  "text": "My advisor let me and his other students know that he is interviewing for a position at another university a couple of states over. He seems pretty confident he\u2019ll get it. While I\u2019m happy he is moving forward in his career, I feel fairly betrayed. My wife has a career in our current city and we have a kid so it\u2019s not like I can just get up and move. I am a second year PhD student and am just about to propose my thesis. What experiences have you all had with this sort of transition? How is it following your advisor to a new school? How is it staying behind and having to switch advisor or be advisor-less? Any tips for managing the transition? Any help/thoughts are appreciated.",

He just got another supervisor who was kind of close to being able to advise him on his topic, and did a lot of self-directed work. The stronger you personally are in your content knowledge and specialization, the better off you'll be.\n\nI can't realistically see any good reason to follow your supervisor unless perhaps you are a) planning on pursuing academic professionally, b) have no other half-decent options for supervision, and c) cannot possibly finish your topic without a subject matter expert either due to your own knowledge/abilities or because your field is that discriminatory. I mean, HE might be cool to continue supervising you, but will his new university accept you? Will they transfer your course credits? Will they offer you the funding structure you have at your current university? Will the program requirements even be the same?\n\nMy personal advice is the cut bait and find a substitute at your own university.

I was also about to assemble my thesis committee and have my proposal. \n\nIf you can find someone else to work with at your university, stay and work with them. It takes so damn long to get reestablished at a university that it'll absolutely delay your graduation date. Having followed my advisor, I find it so hard to believe that doing so is in a student's best interests, while such a decision is a straight win for an advisor. Make the best decision for you. \n\nMy situation was pretty awful, I suppose. Never knew my advisor was interviewing, they just... Expected me to join them. I heard in May and needed to decide by June. Oh yeah, and this was in the middle of COVID. My wife was heartbroken. \n\nNow, according to my advisor, I'm about two years behind schedule, and my advisor enjoys reminding me of this fact every single time I meet with them. Behind what schedule? I do human subjects research, how the hell were we supposed to get anything done when the country was closed? \n\nHonestly, I feel like I could quit, I'm so tired of my advisor. One of the reasons they left the first university was their propensity to burn bridges within their department. I don't know why I expected that to just magically change, I hardly know any faculty at this new university but we've got a reputation of overworking students.\n\nThese days I'm mostly fueled by spite and stubbornness. Not passion for my research. Occasionally I'll get to work on something that excites me. But it's happening less frequently with each month.\n\nE: OK, like 90% of the above was just me grinding my personal axe. The practical concerns are to wonder about class credit transfer. I lost a year of classes when I switched and had to retake some poorly taught hybrid classes. You'll also have to start a new IRB/IACUC program from scratch, which is very time consuming.",

I had applied around (incl staying at my M.S. with my advisor, though the university was not the best career wise moving forward) and got into my number one choice that rejected me when I applied from my B.S. \n\nI had no idea my advisor was moving while I was trying to decide what to do, number one school or stay with the advisor I knew was a perfect fit for me. She didn't want to tell me and have that pressure me to move with her over my top choice, but she ended up caving and telling me before I had to commit. \n\nThe move was pretty seamless for me and other students who were in the middle of the PhD already. New school was great with having flexibility on transferring courses/bending requirements/etc. \n\nWe all had the option to stay and get a new advisor since we had contracts, but I imagine that would have been a nightmare since no other profs had similar research areas. \n\nDidn't meet my spouse until moving to the new location, and the other students were already living apart from spouses during grad. The SO situation would really complicate things if I was already married before moving. This did come up after graduating and there were no employers nearby in my field; fortunately wife's field has jobs pretty much anywhere.",

It was to MIT, which I feel like is a chance you don\u2019t pass up\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t to a top school I don\u2019t think I would have gone. But my situation was very different, no kids and my (now) husband\u2019s PI happened to be married to my PI so we were both involved in the move. I\u2019d say it took like 6+ months to actually get back up and running to full productivity after the move. Some students who moved had to do an extra requirement that the department they were formerly affiliated with didn\u2019t require, but all of my classes transferred and I didn\u2019t have to redo my proposal or other oral exams. I wouldn\u2019t transfer if it means starting over. I also lost all of my friends I had made at my former school, which sucked. I still Zoom with a few of them, but it\u2019s different than being in person, as I\u2019m sure we all know after the past two years. So my support system of peers was cut off, I essentially have no \u2018class\u2019 cohort now, and also have no support system of professors. I never took any classes at MIT so I have no connection to any other profs here. Other than that the research group dynamic stayed the same so day-to-day work wasn\u2019t that much different. Just very isolated until I could make new friends here, which I did eventually do. Overall I think it was the right move for my specific situation. We liked the Boston area enough to buy a house here and the job market is fantastic for biotech. But if there weren\u2019t so many logical reasons for it being the right move, I don\u2019t think it would have done it again. It was extremely stressful and heartbreaking, and my relationship with my PI sucks anyway so I could have been equally happy if not happier transferring to a different PI at my old school, which several students who used to be in the lab did with success. Your first two years of research are usually garbage anyway, so starting a new project in a different lab won\u2019t lose you that much time and you\u2019ll be able to gain momentum much faster because your skills have grown. Anyway, only you know the full situation and what choice is right for you. But I would start talking to the department office and other professors you have connections with and explore options. No one is going to blame you if you don\u2019t move, and if your department is worth it\u2019s salt they\u2019ll help you find a new lab.",
