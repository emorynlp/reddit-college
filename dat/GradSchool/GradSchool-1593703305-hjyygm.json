I mean come on, we're in the middle of a global pandemic that's having psychological effects on us that we haven't really fully realized. \n\nOn top of that, we have to think about research again? My research feels so freaking pointless in the grand scheme of things right now! It's only normal that you feel like it's a lot. I'm also troubleshooting something that I've done well plenty of times before, working on one thing that's kind of interesting, and trying to get my stipend paid to me because administrators ain't shit. We have to figure out how to get to campus and back safely without exposing ourselves to COVID, whether that's paying for parking, gingerly taking the bus, or investing in some sort of commuting tool like a bike or scooter.\n\nI'm 100% with you. Treat yoself. Believe me, I feel your pain. We're all in this together.",

But all the pressure on top of working in shifts and returning back to lab after 2 months out of it isn\u2019t helping. New experiments are difficult when you also can\u2019t get close enough to anyone to have them show you.\n\nI feel your frustration, and I hope things start looking up for you soon. A key part of research going well is confidence, and that\u2019s difficult when it seems like everything is working against you. Hang in there!",

I go through my ritual of going in the office, putting on lab pants, going to lab, sanitizing everything, then setting up my bench space.

Ever since March when this whole thing heated up, I have found I have more space taken up in my brain by world news, and less space available for planning experiments and thinking about science. I have thought about it and decided that I must accept a lower level of productivity for the benefit of my mental health and well-being. The most important thing is your health! My advice to you, which is what I've been doing myself, is to accept a new normal of reduced hours spent working and thinking about work, and more hours for self-care. I have found that putting less pressure on myself to perform and be highly productive during this CRAZY fucking time has been beneficial. \nGood luck and take care.",

So, remember to be gentle with yourself!\n\n- Ask for a break if you need a break;**do NOT make the mistake of trying to push through the early signs of burnout or else you WILL regret it**\n- Ration your news intake (including exposure via Facebook)\n- Every morning when you get out of bed, take 5\u201310 seconds to try and touch your toes without bending your knees\n- Drink more water throughout the day\n- Find an entertaining, easy-reading fiction book with a visually interesting cover to read before bed (I'm enjoying [The Boy from the Woods](https://smile.amazon.com/The-Boy-from-Woods-Harlan-Coben-audiobook/dp/B07ZPDRVYF) right now)\n- Set your alarm to wake up at the same time every morning (but maybe give yourself Saturdays)\n- Treat yourself to your favorite kind of juice the next time you get groceries\n- Try to take a short walk in the morning and another in the evening\n- Make sure you are still setting time aside for hobbies, friends, etc\n- Listen to an engaging, lighthearted podcast like [We Have Concerns](http://www.wehaveconcerns.com/)\n- Call someone who makes you happy just to say hi, especially if this isn't something you routinely do\n- Start casually learning a language on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) or something unrelated to work/productivity on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)\n- If you have a roommate and you both drink, then watch an entertainingly ridiculous action movie and play a drinking game ([source 1](https://www.ranker.com/list/best-movies-for-drinking-games/ranker-film), [source 2](https://www.lovepanky.com/my-life/work-and-office/best-movie-drinking-games), [source 3](https://www.gamesradar.com/50-best-movie-drinking-games/))\n- After your break, ease back into work by reviewing your process to see if there are any points where you can reduce the need for willpower (I highly recommend [How to Take Smart Notes](https://smile.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction/dp/1542866502?sa-no-redirect=1), which recommends the [Zettelkasten method](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125); if you get into it, then I also recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))",

The problem is not that I don't know what to do or I'm not prepared, but the little problems that used to be annoying are now almost day-ruining because I feel I'm so far behind. Then, the bigger \"catastrophes\" which ruined my day or week before seem career-ending now.\n\nI'm just whining.",

              "text": "You definitely aren't just whining! That's a very common issue that can arise when in an anxiety-provoking, uncertain situation like this pandemic. Your brain and body are already in a constant state of stress response due to the current state of the world, which leads to emotional as well as physical burnout, and can mean that previously \"minor\" problems feel like impossible, day/life-ruining catastrophes because you don't have the same emotional bandwidth to deal with them. You're not alone in that response, and it doesn't mean you're doing something wrong, our brains can only handle so much stressful stimuli at one time. I don't have a solution for you, but like a lot of people have said, just try to be gentle with yourself and figure out what level of \"productivity\" you can reasonably aim for, and don't beat yourself up if that level is lower than it was before this happened. Best of luck to you!",
