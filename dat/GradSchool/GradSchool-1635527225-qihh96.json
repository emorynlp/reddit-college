  "title:": "Lab excluded me from a meeting today",
  "text": "I guess I was the only one that attended the meeting online today.\n\nEveryone else was present in-person, but I wasn't -- I had my reasons, I basically had a chunkload of meetings this morning and there was no way I'd be able to make the meeting in-person. As soon as work finished, I had a meeting with my country's embassy (it was a panel interview for funding), and I had a window of (a whopping) *4 minutes* until the lab meeting started. The drive to campus takes around 10 minutes and I was starving: I was sort of hoping I'd have a bite to eat while discussions were going on (I wouldn't weigh on much, I'm just a mere undergraduate honours student and the lab just adopted me so I can gain graduate student experience). The paper to be discussed during the session was very chunky too, I had spent 2 days reading it with nothing seeping in my head (it was an evolution paper and I: 1 have not taken evolution and 2 am currently taking introductory genetics).\n\nFor context, our lab meets every week and honestly I'm the only undergrad that attends the meetings (there are two of us undergrads, the second is in a field school and has spotty internet for this semester). This morning, I had worked from 8am-12nn, meetings were at 1pm. Due to timezones, I didn't actually read the notice the embassy had given me until I had woken up and I had to attend the panel... so I couldn't even have given the lab quick enough notice. I mean, I could have done it in the morning, but that genuinely make me feel like a dick and a half for cancelling last minute (so I opted on not sending an email).\n\nCall notification showed up for the lab meeting, joined and there was a faculty member in the call along with the meeting host (a student), next thing I know the faculty member leaves the call because they're on-campus (but in a different room) and I'm the only one that isn't.\n\nCall ends out of the blue. I try joining back in, but definitely seems like I just got excluded from the call (i.e. there was no virtual meeting anymore, seeing as everyone was in-person).\n\nGod, I'm so embarrassed. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I send an email to my supervisor it'll come out super excuse-y and gross. I don't know -- I feel like I've been disappointing my supervisor recently too (I had a faculty presentation that I sort of bombed) and I feel like I really should have given the lab an early notice going like \"hey babes i'm going to be online today, that ok?\" \n\nI feel like I fucked up. I mean, I'll see this supervisor again on Monday (we regularly meet up then) but I don't know if I should say something now, or if I should say something on Monday instead. What should I do?",

      "text": "I think you probably did not fuck up as bad as you are thinking you did in your head - just to ease your anxiety I'd just send an email apologizing for missing the meeting and saying that you thought you'd be able to join online. Might be worth inquiring about if the virtual meetings will continue to be held when most people are in person.",

          "text": "I agree. It sounds like a simple mistake on the part of whoever was supposed to organize the online part of the meeting. A simple follow up email meeting with a quick sorry for missing the meeting and a question about clarifying whether there will be online options in the future seems like it's a good idea. Don't overthink it too much. It's an awkward time with no one really being sure how to navigate hybrid meetings.",

      "text": "I think you're thinking about this much more than they probably are. They probably didn't realize that they accidentally excluded you. If you're worried about it, a brief email like others described is fine. I also think you could just show up to the next meeting and not worry about this again. The number of times I've had a zoom call go wrong and the host or PI doesn't ever realize it can't be counted on my fingers.",

      "text": "Like others have already mentioned, there's a good chance that it was nothing more than a technical issue.  As a matter of fact, I just went to a hybrid in-person/Zoom talk, and the laptop ran out of battery and cut off the Zoom connection in the middle of the Q&A session.  It happens.  Again, as others suggested, an email should hopefully clear things up. Hope you feel better!",
