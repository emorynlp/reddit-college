Sometimes, it can be tough, it can be embarrassing because they speak multiple languages, because they dress better, because they can bring back fancy lunches and I\u2019m over in my cube eating corn pone for breakfast every day, because they go to lots of different countries on their summer breaks aside from their home nations.\nThe thing is that I have so many functional skills that they don\u2019t, and they appreciate the hell out of me for that. I fixed the coffee maker in the office because it had sat there broken for almost a year, I keep the plants in the window alive so that there\u2019s some oxygen in our stuffy ass office, and I\u2019ve taught more than one colleague to cook. We get so focused on the flashy stuff that we don\u2019t look underneath to see if people have the basics, and the basics are what keep you alive.\nYou\u2019re working on having both.

In grad school you end up the average of your closest classmates, and by choosing who you spend time with carefully you can raise yourself up.\n\nIn most cases however, you are comparing your whole self to someone else's best attributes (which they display publicly).",

I think one of the best things I did was surround myself with people who were \"better.\" This made me set a bar for my expectations, and get assistance from them in getting there. \n\nWhat steps did you take to learn X? Where did you struggle the most, how would you avoid it?\n\nAsking these questions and acknowledging that you don't have the knowledge is the best way to \"fast track\" your experience because people tend to be open to helping with that. You can learn from their mistakes and successes. If you fake that you have the experience and put up a front that you are already knowledgable, you just hurt yourself. \n\nOnce you gain the knowledge, be sure to help others, just as they helped you!\n\nOn a side note, your first sentence...\n> I have had the chance to interact with other grad students whose genius just made me marvel every single time they opened their mouth.\n\nI think going through the programs, you run across people all the time like this. \"They just seem so knowledgable, so much further ahead, how can they only be in year 2?!\" But what I have come to realize, granted this is anecdotal, is that usually younger students are just so damn sure of themselves. I've made it this far, I must know what I'm talking about, clearly this person hasn't thought of X or Y, etc. The reality is that they are usually blowing smoke. Some people can be very confident up front and present themselves well, but that front can be paper-thin.\n\nFrom watching other students, this seems to go away over the years, or at least dampen. Gradually, they realize how little they actually know about anything, so the types of questions change and that assurance in the answers go away. Not always, but many times.\n\nI recall sitting in a meeting one day when this younger student was presenting some work where he used a public database for something. Looked great on the surface; I asked one simple question about controlling for a variable in that, and the immediate response was that he didn't know how to use the software and so he couldn't be sure, etc... But he had just spent the past 5 minutes talking about how this graph proves his position for X and what it means.",

But sometimes there are people who are just ridiculously clever. Unfortunately for my mediocre ass and fragile ego, they exist. And it's fine, they are a minority and learning from them (not book knowledge, more from their attitude) is certainly better than sulking or trying to diminish them.",

So ye I think you have a background that only you can have, a passion that only you can possess.

The only person you can compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday. Did you do one thing\u2014anything\u2014that moved you closer to your goals today?

I went to the \"elite\" city university and the rural, land grant university. Both had good people, both had bad people. But there were more farm boys at the latter, and it was a much better atmosphere. I will always choose to stay at that kind of institution, honestly.",

              "text": "Never to discredit anyone but in my opinion, rural people have a deeper appreciation of opportunities because they are few and far between. We are raised having to work now, complain later with limited finances and parents who teach us that humility and hard work will be rewarded in kind. We know we won\u2019t get rich but we will be rewarded for our labors. And we help others cause we know that one day we will need help ourselves, whether it\u2019s doing research or loading hay trailers. \nAs you\u2019ve said, there are good and bad people in all groups, but in my experiences, the city is where more money is and is where people have to be closed off because of the danger in the urban environment, making them seem rude or snobby. This perceived attitude coupled with more financial opportunities makes them sometimes unappreciative of the things they have.\n\nNow of course, I know this isn\u2019t true across the board and I\u2019ve known assholes raised in the farm who think the world owes them something and I\u2019ve meet good ole boys who grew up in city blocks who would give you their last dollar and the pot they piss in. Simply put, if they act square with me, they\u2019re all right. \n\nIt don\u2019t matter where you begin, only where you end up and the lives you touch along the way. That\u2019s something OP will have to find out for themselves just like I had to, but the fact that he/she is asking the question means it\u2019s a step in the right direction. Regardless of what OP does, I\u2019m proud of what he/she has accomplished despite not knowing a thing about them.",

I don't know too much about cars, but I know a little about wiring. Figured it might be something simple. We go to pop the hood and I found an entire aftermarket security system installed ON TOP OF the stock system. Come to find out, he didn't even know about the extra system and had been accidentally leaving it in a battery-draining mode every time he parked the car.\n\nIt took me an hour to uninstall that monstrosity, and the car runs great now. My roommate still thinks I'm some kind of magical Fix-it Felix.",
