  "text": "So so far I only have one professor replied my email who stated she would write for me but due to the long term pandemic she could only offer my performance in the class discussion/papers but nothing strong about my personalities. Let\u2019s say even I manage to find 3 profs writing for me but just completely nothing particular out of classes since we don\u2019t have strong personal relationships, how big is the chance I could get admitted by a grad school? I\u2019m applying to 7-8 geography programs and schools are mainly ranked 100-150th in the US.",

      "text": "I only knew one of the professors I asked to write a letter of rec decently well. (He was my boss for an undergrad teaching job but I'd never had him as an instructor). For my other two profs I asked department heads/ profs that had been at the university for a long time that had mentioned to at least one student that they'd write a letter of rec for pretty much anyone that had been in their class where they made an A in the class. I had to (or got to depending on how you look at it) write one of them myself. For the other professor he asked me for my resume before he wrote the letter of rec. I still have no clue what they said but I think it was ok. I'm currently getting my masters at a similarly ranked school. I didn't get into most of the schools I applied to but I think the primary reason was not reaching out to any potential advisors. Secondary I think was not doing any undergraduate research. I think the letters of REC were fine. Ask around in your department and see if any of your previous professors are known for being nice about writing letters of rec? 2/3 of my letters were also from professors in a complimentary but different field from my undergrad and masters.",
