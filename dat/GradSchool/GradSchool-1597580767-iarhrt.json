  "text": "My small minded parents think that going blonde (not anywhere near platinum, but more a natural blonde with tones from my current reddish brown hair color) will make me look younger, and leave a bad first impression when I do interviews with PIs this fall.\n\nTheir words: \u201cyou are there to be a scientist not to be glamorous\u201d\n\nWhat the actual fuck? Shouldn\u2019t you be allowed to embrace femininity and also be a graduate student?\n\nIt\u2019s 2020. I guess this is more of a rant because prejudice like this still exists. It\u2019s like my own family sees me going to grad school like an \u201cact\u201d and I\u2019m \u201cplaying scientist\u201d and I \u201cdon\u2019t fit\u201d and need to worry about stupid shit like first impressions because I got highlights?

In my experience, there is no correlation between personal aesthetic and quality of work in academia. \n\nYou don\u2019t want a PI that\u2019s superficial in their assessments, so if someone makes a judgement call using personal aesthetic as a criteria, this could be a good filter/red flag for you. Just a reminder: it is equally, if not more important, for the PI to impress you, and you should be extremely choosy in your assessment of them. There are many PIs with \u201cless-than-ideal\u201d qualities (either sinking research or poor mentorship style) just hoping to get students.",

As for how you might look in school, really it does not matter. I am an undergrad student and the top scorer in my faculty changes her hair colour every month or two. Literally no fucks given in the school LOL. You might consider the likings of your professor though, usually, they do not grade on your visuals but I have seen some teachers and professors dislike colourful hairs (as in non-natural colours) and often gave results below what they deserve. But again, the students wrote a letter to the head stating the incident and the professor was strictly moved down to teach lower classes and the results were rechecked by others by which my friend got an A+ from B.",

Hair color truly has no bearing, especially if it's a natural color like blond. Your parents probably have good intentions but do not realize the current culture in graduate school.",

She recommended I stay natural.\n\nI never got an interview and proceeded to go full platinum white. Then I got an interview at another school and rolled in with my white hair and white pants with colorful fucking flowers all over them and got the job.\n\nMy therapist happens to be department chair at the first school I mentioned, and he's like 6'4'' with neck and knuckle tattoos, ear gauges, and black nail polish. \n\nIt shouldn't matter. We who are entering academia need to... make it not matter.\n\nAnother argument: A Black colleague of mine often wears turbans and do-rags. His students, male and female, have often told him how inspiring it is to see someone in \"Black\" clothing teaching at a college. \n\nThis goes the other way, too--there's a prof at my school whose uniform is a three-piece suit with bow tie and pocket square. I swear he brilliantines his hair and teleports in from the 1920s every day. His office is all wood with tea cups and antique books and ornate rugs.

      "text": "In your particular case, I think fine.\n\nTo answer your questions more generally:\n\nAs a few others have answered, I think the \"when\" and \"how much\" are kind of the key points to this question. \n\nAs everyone has said, your appearance isn't going to matter that much once you're in the door. \n\nFor interviews/professional dress occasions, conservative is generally safer. Neutral-colored clothing that covers the chest, shoulders, knees. Neutral-toned makeup, hair and nails neat and well-maintained, hair color within the range of natural colors.\n\nNow, note that I said safer, not that you have to dress that way. I would still say that during admissions all your clothes should at the very least pass the high-schools dress code check. You should be good with having color in your look (hair, clothes) without it detracting from your professionalism as long as it's styled well (hair: neat, clothes: fitting appropriately).\n\nAs has been mentioned though, it is still true that people may be biased against you for looking too \"glamorous.\" I don't think your hair color as you described it falls under that category, but your parents can see you unlike us, and their outlook is not only theirs to have but may be shared by others.\n\nGrad school interviews/admissions is about fit. Can you present yourself professionally? Are you someone who will contribute intellectually? Do you get along well with others? \n\nI'd say that conservative dress balances well if you're going to be a bit more outgoing and relaxed. Similarly, acting more professional balances out a less-conservative look.",

Ultimately what you look like and how you present yourself are up to you and I doubt whatever you choose will be a deal-breaker to getting into your program.",

Most professors expect grad students to be young and a little less conventional than, let's say your average corporate office worker.

I've seen from both sides of the room and students are easier to teach and control if you \"look the part\"\n2) when you interview for jobs after grad school or internships during grad school you should dress professionally. What ever that means in your field, just dress for the part.\n3) while in grad school you can get away with a lot in most western countries. Occasionally you find an old professor who doesn't like girls in a romper but... They probably still feel uncomfortable with black people voting.... so some older professors are just old. You can't really change their minds sometimes. Try not to worry so much and the handful of people who are out of date.\n\nWithin my program most women don't wear makeup to work or class but the ones who do tend to go pretty light. Most wear pretty conservative clothing. A few like rompers. When we attend conferences or professional events women tend to dress in business clothing more than guys.\n\nDon't worry about some hair color. Most professors just care about your ability to work.

I\u2019m not saying do that lmao it was just a combination of not caring, computer work, being broke, etc... but just throwing that out there, our PI did not even notice, and didn\u2019t care as long as we got our work done.\n\nEdit: you can talk to current students about work culture and expectations to help gauge what the PI is like if that helps.
