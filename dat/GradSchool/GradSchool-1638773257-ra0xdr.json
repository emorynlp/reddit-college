  "text": "Hi all, \n\nI have come across few SOP prompts for MS CS that are asking to mention future/career plans in SOP.\n\nI am interested in NON THESIS course and a job after graduation. \n\nShould I mention that I want to do a industry job afterwards? I feel this could affect my application negatively. \n\nAnd if I write I'm interested in research will that boost my chances of getting admited given everything else same. \n\nOne solution is to either *not mention about job even when SOP prompt asks for future plans* \nor \nWrite research as future plan. \n\nI am applying for UMASS AMHERST, UCD etc.\n\nAny suggestions?",
