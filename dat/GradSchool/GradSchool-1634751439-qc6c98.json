  "text": "I'm a terrible procrastinator. I took a gap year after graduating with my Bachelor's in psychology to work on my resume and prepare for graduate school (and also just to take a mental break after dealing with COVID-ified college). However, I still haven't begun studying for the GRE or done any research to narrow down the schools to which I'd like to apply. Am I just too late to feasibly do these things? Do I have to take another gap year now?",

If it's high enough for the programs you want to apply to, then you could just take the test. Studying for the GRE is common but by no means necessary if you're already getting the score you want.\n\nYou should definitely start doing these things now, though. You'll need to notify your letter-writers soon. My first applications were due at the end of November when I applied.",

Yeah, there are some things you can study (e.g. word lists of exotic definitions), but for the most part, studying (for me) focused on understanding what the question was asking.\n\nSo, no, you haven't left it too late.  As others of have suggested, a few practice tests should help you a lot.",

      "text": "I think you should sit down and research schools right away because that will tell you how feasible it is to apply in the first place. Like if their deadlines are November 1st, it's probably too late if you haven't taken the GRE yet. But if they're December or January, you still have time. You probably have a list of schools in mind if you think about it, even if it's just ones in areas you'd like to live in. Just sit down and make a spreadsheet.\n\nI also second the person who said to take a practice GRE test after you figure out what deadlines are for programs. It helped me be more efficient in studying since I really didn't need to review every math concept they test on. If you bomb it, next year might be better (start studying earlier!) but if you're already above the cut offs for programs you want to apply to, you can just do maybe a small amount of reviewing and take the test this year.",

      "text": "Are you aiming for fall 2022? It's not impossible, that's for sure. It's potentially improbable, however, depending on the program you're interested in. If you're applying to a PhD program, it's probably not enough time to get all your ducks in a row - particularly if you haven't taken the GRE or narrowed down the schools.  If you're at that point, particularly the latter, then you haven't really done a lot of the heavy lifting, as what type(s) of programs you apply to can vary greatly between what schools offer what programs, what faculty are there, etc. If you're looking for a more general Master's program though, you have time still. But if you haven't contacted LOR writers, prepared your resume, or written a personal statement, these can take a while (and it can be considered rude to contact LOR writers \"last minute\").\n\nYou mention that you're a procrastinator, but you also had a boatload of time to do this. There could've easily been extenuating circumstances in your life preventing you from getting yourself together, even as simple as focusing on your mental health post-college. However, you should ask yourself if you really want to do this if you've put it off so long. The answer may still be yes, but your actions would indicate otherwise thus far.",

I would spend today taking a GRE practice exam to see where you're at (it can improve a bit with just a little amount of studying but very drastic changes are unlikely.

I didn't bother to study for writing or reading (and honestly idk how you would) and did maybe a few days of math prep. I didn't do as well as I could have if I had really crunched on prep but I got above a 50th percentile and had no problem getting into my top choice programs.\n\nThe GRE isn't like the MCAT or LSAT and you likely can take it this month with a bit of prep and do fine on it. Now, in terms of getting letters of rec written and submitted in a timely manner... That might be a different story. I'd say if apps are due Dec or Jan, then you could make it but some probably had Oct 1 cutoff dates.",
