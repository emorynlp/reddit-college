  "text": "This isn't a question, I just need someone to empathize with me. My university refuses to accept my thesis unless the file is under 35 mb. My research requires a lot of figures (I have about 70) and in order to get the file that small I have to compress them to all hell; some of them aren't even readable anymore. The university doesn't even keep paper copies anymore so this will be the only version of it out there. It just breaks my heart that I put so much time into it just to have any readers only see a crap version because of bureaucracy.",

The most recent exchange was where I gave her my 195mb document (she said the file limit was 200mb) and she said she would talk to \"her programmers\" to try to get it to work. A few days later and she said they had succeeded, but it turns out their idea of success was compressing it down to 35mb and making all my images tiny. I'm not really sure how competent the \"programmer\" is, because she said it took him a full day to shrink the file down but it only takes like 60 seconds to do that with Acrobat Pro's Advanced Optimization.",

Just might take some work.\n\n>Scaling them down so the file is <35mb makes them look awful\n\nIf you're letting the program do it that's doing the PDF conversion, it may be applying a one size fits all solution. So you need to optimize each image before placing it in your document.\n\nYou also may need to set your PDF program not to adjust your images once they are well optimized for size. \n\n>Charts and tables are greyscale.\n\nWhat file format did you save them in before inserting them in your document? GIFs are only 8 bit, maximum of 256 colors.  They are lossless other than that, but generally have a small file size.\n\nSo with images that have very few colors, especially grayscale, converting them to GIFs before you put them in your document could greatly reduce their size.\n\n>Most of the figures are maps and need to be full color.\n\nMaps can also often be converted to GIF, as they use a small color set compared to photographs.\n\nJust take a couple of your map images and convert them. See what I mean?",

And so the more you have the PDF program reduce the file size, the more it's going to compress the images with lossy compression.\n\nSince these are not photographs, converting them all to GIF and making sure they are the correct resolution before being placed in the file probably will solve the problem. And if not, then dropping them to 72 DPI if the document still exceeds the maximum file size would take it the rest of the way.\n\nHard to know for sure. The OP hasn't replied to me.
