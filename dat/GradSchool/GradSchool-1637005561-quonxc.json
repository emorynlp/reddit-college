  "title:": "Pretty sure my lab mates are feeling pretty burnt out - what is the best way I can help?",
  "text": "I recently started a full-time lab manager position for a lab with three grad students and one postdoc. Our PI can be a pain in the ass, and it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a whole lot of lab camaraderie or strong relationships between any members. Recently, I\u2019ve noticed my lab mates looking more tired, speaking up less, working from home more, and generally getting less done. I know the weeks leading up to the holidays are tough, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just looking forward to the break ahead. However, I honestly haven\u2019t had too much to do in the past 2-3 weeks, I\u2019m feeling relatively fresh, and I\u2019d really like to do something nice for everyone. \n\nWhat is the best way to support my lab mates and maybe boost morale? In a perfect world, what would you want from a research staffer, professionally and coming from a human perspective?",

Those can seem insurmountable when burnt out. \n\nAnd probably more important, do whatever you can to encourage people to take time off and have firm boundaries between work and personal life. If there's a culture of long hours/overwork/being available at all times, do your best to change that. \n\nThat's what will actually help with burnout.",

      "text": "From a human perspective? Some sort of interaction that didn't involve being in the lab, didn't involve anything related to work, and didn't cost me money. It's nice to have a beer or 3 with the people in my group on occasion, too, but that's less frequent because of my budget. One of the things I find really refreshing is going on short hikes on the weekends with the people in my group. It's not an option for everyone, but it's a really nice way to break the monotony of the slog that is grad school. Your mileage may vary with this one, depending on how social/outdoorsy the students are.\n\nIn the office/lab itself, like having coffee/tea available and a place to enjoy it away from the immediate tasks is really nice. Before the pandemic, my research group had a weekly lunch at one of the cheaper local restaurants, but that has been kind of nixed as of late. That was always a good opportunity for people to interact/bond/network/etc.\n\nBurn out is not an easy thing to fight, speaking from experience, students will often stretch themselves in order to meet deadlines and get things done, especially while still doing coursework (Physics typically has no coursework after 2-3 years into the PhD here). Over time this deficit of self care time just builds until their productivity starts to wane. I think what I'm trying to say is that you should (if appropriate) encourage them to take time for themselves away from work/school.",

      "text": "Make sure you let them know when they do something well. Sometimes we get in a rut because we are used to offering negative critiques, but it\u2019s just as important to show people that their effort is appreciated and they\u2019re doing a good job. Always thank them (and mean it \u2013 sincerely). Everyone deserves to feel valued. \n\nWhat sort of things do you have the ability to change as a lab manager? I liked to sit down with people and ask them how they\u2019re doing. That will give you the most insight here. I also ask if there\u2019s anything they\u2019re having trouble with. I ask what their goals are, and how we can shape their work to make sure they\u2019re building the skills and CV they need to succeed. People will be happier and do better work if you play to their strengths. I would also run through upcoming deadlines and help them prioritize.\n\nI found when I did that, people were pretty honest. It made it easier for them to bring up issues or ask for help in the future, too. \n\nIf it\u2019s at all possible, if you see folks are working extremely long hours, I would try to work out a way for them to cut back. Yes, the work is important, but keeping people healthy matters more. I\u2019m not suggesting you micromanage, but if you can reshuffle some stuff or get a deadline extended, it can help stress levels a lot. \n\nThis stuff requires some buy-in from the professor, and depending on how they\u2019re used to treating people, you could be sticking your neck out pretty far. I hope that\u2019s not the case. I would sure hope you could at least sit down with lab members and then go to the professor if you see any needs that could be met. Sometimes it\u2019s a training opportunity or conference, or a presentation opportunity. Sometimes people just feel overwhelmed and want a break (but be careful how you frame that to the prof). Regardless, it can make a big difference to people to get that support.",
