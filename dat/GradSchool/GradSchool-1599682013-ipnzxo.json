Make a check list of emails to send, make a check list of manuscripts to work on (then sections within each manuscript), make a check list of items to prepare for the next days lab work. I have my check lists in my calendar on my phone so that whenever I think of a task I can add it, and when I've done a task I can remove it. Don't just add a task to the list though. Add a time for that task to get done, if it needs to be broken up and done over a few days that's totally fine, just make sure it gets done. Eventually you will find a method that works for you and keeps your tasks efficient. They say if you want something done give it to a busy person, because they'll find time to get it done. This is definitely how grad school is. However, be sure to fit in leisure and activities that support your mental health. Otherwise you will get catastrophically burnt out and all the planning will go to the way side. Remember, grad school doesn't have to be miserable. I actually love grad school. Same days are long, but for me personally the good absolutely outweighs the bad.",

      "text": "I have found that I am way more productive in the mornings than at any other part of the day. So I have started reserving the first 2hrs of the day for high priority tasks. This has helped my stress and time management so much and I would definitely recommend giving it a shot. I typically do my planning on Friday morning so that I can go into the weekend knowing there is a game plan in place. Also, so if my advisor asks for an update on what I plan to do (which she loves to send random Friday or weekend emails) that I am ready to send a response. Monday - Thursday I focus on assignments/reading/writing/progress reports etc. The remainder of the day is dedicated to benchwork. I try to never plan for more than 5-6hrs worth of benchwork in a day because science often takes longer than you would expect even with careful planning.",

      "text": "If you're in a biology field, this approach might help with academic article consumption:\n\n* Print the article out. Devote your attention to this task without distraction. \n* Decide *a priori* how relevant the paper is to your research. If it's for lab journal club, treat it as highly relevant. If it's for a class the treat it as lower relevance. \n* For low relevance, read the abstract carefully, look at the figures, and their descriptions, if necessary to understand. If you get the story, you can move on. If you don't get it, skim the results section to see if it can help you make sense of their narrative. Skip the introduction, methods and discussion unless there's something that catches your eye. Write the narrative in your own words either on the front page, or beside the figures. \n* For high relevance, do the above first, and the read the whole damn paper. The methodology section becomes super important here. Take copious notes. Go through the author's logic piece by piece. Think about whether there are alternative explanations that fit the data. Identify the gaps in knowledge. Then read it again, but this time think about how it relates to your own research. Take more notes. \n\nYou will forget what you've read. But you will hopefully remember your notes and why you wrote those notes. \n\nNot all papers deserve the same degree of attention to serve your purpose. You can churn through a lot of papers relatively quickly by just getting the gist of it and moving on.\n\nNB: you really need to read a lot of papers first before you get a feel for understanding a narrative from the abstract and figures alone. But as with anything, the more practice you have at something, the better you'll get at it.\n\nNB2: I have no idea what other STEM field papers look like and I don't have a clue about non-STEM fields. I suspect a similar attention-priority approach is generally applicable.",

Prioritize what you need to do each day. Pick one or two things that need to be done that day, with a few other smaller tasks you can work on if you finish early but can also be done later if you run out of time.",

Sometimes, it is that bad, but more often than not, it's their attitude. I don't like those kind of negative thinkers, and I stay away from them IRL because this negative mentality can spread. \n\nFor many (maybe most?), grad school is a great experience. It's challenging, but it's supposed to be. Don't go to grad school unless you love doing what it entails. It doesn't entail 12-16 hr days unless you have shitty self-control",
