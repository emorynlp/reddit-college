  "title:": "Grad students have to listen to our bodies during times of stress because our minds are too busy to realize we're stressed out",
  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nSo, I don't know if others can relate, but I find that because 1) PhD program's demand that you constantly be producing and working and 2) it is often the case that very \"go-go-go\" people are attracted to/ excel within academia, it is easy to not register when you are stressed out.\n\nWithin academia, I think the line between enjoying your work and over-working yourself is thin and that, as a result, it is hard to identify when you start pushing yourself too far, which is only magnified by the fact that, because we are constantly spending so much of our emotional and intellectual energy on our work, we tend to forget to check in with ourselves.\n\nSomething I have realized (I am currently in my 3rd year of my PhD program after doing a 2 year Masters) is that my body will tell me that I am stressed out long before my mind will start to register it, and that paying attention to your body and the signs it gives you in regards to being stressed is key to promoting your mental health within academia.\n\nI feel like these \u201csigns\u201d vary from person to person, but for me, they are often:\n\n1. Troubles sleeping - either insomnia, particularly even after taking sleeping pills, or waking up throughout the night. \n\n2. Having achy and sore muscles \u2013 this is typically more than the usual back/trap pain and elbow/wrist pain associated with extensive laptop use. For example, my legs get very lethargic when I am stressed, even after a good night sleep. \n\n3. Feeling abnormally warm \u2013 my body temperature is consistently higher. \n\n4. Feeling exhausted and lethargic during the day even after a good sleep\n\n5. Heart palpitations that do not seem to be linked to anything \n\n6. Craving sugar or alcohol \u2013 not just liking or desiring these things, but legit craving them\n\n7. Increased anxiety that typically is not socially motivated: for example, during high times of stress I am more likely to check to see if my oven is on before leaving the house even if I know it\u2019s off, but personally, I do not feel more anxious around other people (I am also more of an extravert).\n\n8. Increased irritability \n\n9. Changes in appetite \u2013 a few years ago, my appetite went up when I was stressed, but now it decreases. However, in general, I will engage in more \u201cemotional\u201d eating when stressed.\n\nEdit. 10. Sometimes my left eye will twitch. \n\nCan you all relate? Are there any physical signs that you experience that signal to you that you may be stressed even when your mind doesn\u2019t register it? Got any tips for self-care withina academia?",

I'm 22F and I feel like I've aged twenty years in the past five weeks.\n\nMy anxiety disorder has spiked, migraines all the time, feeling fatigued even more (I have anemia so I'm usually tired), mood changes, and my stomach disorder has flared too. Funny enough instead of getting hot all the time, I get really cold and I'm developing TMJ in my jaw because I'm so stressed at night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard and I 100% agree. You gotta be practicing self care. I had to drop a class and it was the best thing I've ever done. Helped reduce my stress ten fold.",

      "text": "I can relate to *all of these*, but especially the fatigue one. I've been having one of those weeks where I wake up, go to work, work non-stop *all* day (save maybe 15min for lunch), come home, eat dinner, work more, go to bed, repeat again in the morning. The fatigue is real. My body is trying to tell me to slow down, but unfortunately work doesn't stop when you mentally/physically need to take a day -- especially when it's events or workshops that you're having to run. \n\nI also find that I am more heavily critical of my marriage when I am stressed out. I expect more out of my home environment because my work environment is terrible... whether it's help cleaning, whether it's for my husband to interact with me and plan things for us to do together, etc. I expect these things all the time, but I am most upset by their absence when my academic work is piling on and causing undue stress. I guess I feel like, because my working environment is causing me a lot of stress, that my home environment should respond to that and be even more supportive. That doesn't happen, lol. ",

I was told by my doctor that I have to de-stress, stat, and I ended up taking an extension and was also put on Zoloft to treat my anxiety. The above symptoms of stress all went away pretty much immediately (even the memory problems, which I was really worried about).\n\nI'm now a few days away from my submission deadline and while I'm stressed out again, it's a lot better. I am always tired and could sleep for ages, and the tension headaches, heart palpitations, and shitty memory are back, but honestly, this is minor compared to how I was one year ago. Plus, I'm almost done.",

Sore - Check, I used to walk 5 miles a day with no problem, since starting this program, my back feels like broken glass in the morning.\n\n4. Exhausted - Check, have to sit down after doing simple things.\n\n5. Heart palpitations - Not sure.  Might just be sudden pangs of increased stress elevating the heart rate.\n\n6. Craving sugar - I don't even want to know how much weight I've gained at this place.\n\n7. Increased anxiety - Check, although that's probably a justified reaction to other problems I've built up as a result of life being garbage.\n\n8. Increased irritability - Check, angry most nights that I ended up in such a crap place after all the effort I put into life, commonly pop 9 mg of melatonin to sleep.\n\nHere's one more: I'm frying my eyes by mindlessly staring into a screen, sometimes when I'm stressed I can see where the vein is throbbing in my vision, and I've got a big pile of facial hair on the flood that I've pulled out.  I hope that grows back.\n\nI cannot wait until I figure out how to get out of this place because my program is killing me.  I didn't used to be like this; my last program, it was easy to stay healthy & happy.  Then it turned out that everything I've worked my hardest for for the past 7 years has led me to this, and this is getting rejected from literally every decent program and lab in my field and ending up at a depressing, isolated, sub-par research station that doesn't even have the facilities to properly do what I need to do.  If I had any clue of what else I wanted to do, I'd be gone.  Hope I can figure it out before I do too much more damage.",

Heart palpitations- that one seems pretty common among all of us, which I find quite concerning\n2. Social anxiety where I have low self-confidence with \u201chigher ups\u201d. At the same time, \u201cregular\u201d people are annoying because they take time away from my work.\n3. A general anxiety throughout the day, which is made 100x worse when people ask me \u201cWhat are you so stressed about?\u201d\n4. The eye twitch\n5. I got that headache that makes flashing diagonal stripes once too. That was creepy. \n6. I get really jumpy because I\u2019m in my head and don\u2019t notice things around me until they\u2019re on me. \n7. I make really stupid mistakes- what we called PhD brain when I was working in administration (because faculty made stupid mistakes so often we would joke that all their smarts went into getting their PhD and none was left for simple logic). \n8. My movements aren\u2019t as coordinated so I accidentally cut or bruise myself a lot more. \n9. My period is early or late, by like a week. . \n10. I crave really rich food (French fries!!) or don\u2019t care to eat at all. \n11. Nothing is fun anymore and everything is an endless to-do list. \n12. My hands shake because I\u2019m in go-go-go mode. \n\nI do find that hobbies help by forcing me to live in another world for a couple of hours, and when I return to work I [sometimes] forget why I was so stressed before.

At this point in school (I'm a 4th year PhD student) I don't experience the anxiety or racing heart as much as I did earlier on (my mental health has definitely evened out in this final year or so), but I can sleep 3 hours or 10 hours and still feel dead on my feet. I've fallen asleep at my desk without realizing it (which is SO unlike me). Thats when I know it's time to take a break, a real one. It's amazing, really, how your body responds to the stress before you even realize how stressed you are!\n\nDefinitely understand the feeling. Grad school has unlocked all sorts of odd things I didn't know my mind or body was capable of. But hey, all part of the experience right? \ud83d\ude02 but it's super important to listen to your body, because nothing is worth that level of stress. I've also found healthy ways of coping, like working out, reading, or spending time with my husband (and kitty cat!). I've found a good balance and try to keep the stress to a manageable level by taking breaks when my body tells me I need to. Otherwise I start royally messing up everything and it's way better to take a few hours or a day to recenter than mess up a week's worth of work. \n\nHang in there! ",

If I don't have that 2 hours, I'll be scattered all day and dropping the ball on everything. This naturally leads me to be either frequently scatter-brained or frequently tardy, which makes me feel very worried about what people are thinking of me even though nobody has made a comment or seems to notice.  \n\n\nSo, because I'm stressed I sleep too much. Because I sleep too much I end up either being scatter-brained or late which stresses me out and increases social anxiety. The stress and social anxiety probably contribute to me needed to sleep more and more. God help me lmao",

I've had a lot of suggestions thrown at me and it's kind of paralyzingly overwhelming, and I just feel so mentally and physically exhausted that it feels hard to figure out where to start. I'm going to talk to my advisor tomorrow, though. She might know more about what's available through the university, and conveniently her husband is also on the city council and might know about resources available through the city as well.",

I was absolutely terrified; they almost exactly mimic a stroke, and I had a few hours in my life where I thought I would never be able to feel or use my left arm again due to having a stroke in my early 20s. Myself and my family have no history of any sort of migraine, so my neurologist asked for details about my everyday life. After a cathartic venting session, he said he was certain it was an extreme reaction to stress, and that I cannot afford to continue working as I had been.\n\nYou are so right about the \"go-go-go\" mentality. The weirdest part of the whole experience is that I was not even the most stressed out person I knew; I was only one year into a Masters! I think it's important to realize that everybody handles stress differently, and everyone's \"too much\" threshold is different. It took me a while to realize that I could not keep up with my coworkers, but my work wasn't worth sacrificing my health over. Nobody else is going to look after you; if you don't, you will just end up hurting yourself.",

Coincidentally, this was the day that my thesis proposal draft was due to my committee and the day  before I flew out  to a research conference - so definitely stress related. \n\nThe ER found no issues in my brain scan, but I would definitely not hesitate to call 911 if you experience any of these symptoms. Even if they find nothing, it's a wake up call and something that a therapist can help you work with.\n",
