  "title:": "Covid has revealed serious flaws in Academia. Seems like academia is in denial about the impact of the pandemic on grad/undergrad students",
  "text": "Currently I'm a second semester MA student at a top 20 school. So far I've frankly been baffled how desperately academia is trying to pretend everything is normal. There is a massive global pandemic which forced everything online, we're seemingly in a second great depression, and many countries including my own (United States) are falling into deep civil unrest. And while all this is going on, as graduate students we're expected to carry on like everything is fine. But everything is not fine. The world is on fire, yet professors keep piling on the work expecting us to keep up.\n\nIt's absolutely unreasonable to expect us to be able to focus on our research during a time like this. Personally, online remote learning is absolute hell. The lack of libraries or cafes open to study outside my room makes studying sooooo much more difficult. Add to that the lack of social interaction for those of us living alone and it's no wonder grad student mental health going down the drain as the world also goes down the drain.\n\nBut strangely...academia has failed to recognize these issues in any meaningful way. When reaching out to professors, advisors, and family friends in academia they all echo the same sentiments \"Push forward\" and \"Seek therapy\". Even today I received a tone deaf email from the dean of my school saying something along the lines of \"During these unprecedented times I hope we can seek refuge in our intellectual research\". To me this is a refusal to acknowledge the emotional, mental, and sometimes even physical difficulties some students are now going though. We're not research machines....we're human beings. Since the beginning of the year I've moved 5 times and was staying in motels for a bit. I know quite a few other grad students with similar experiences...\n\nI find it funny that academia prides itself on being so open to change and forward thinking. Yet when push comes to shove and the world rapidly changes around them, academia proves itself to be just another large (profit motivated) institution that is slow to adapt and recognize problems.\n\nAcademia is deeply in denial about the current state of affairs and it's expectations of students. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way but nobody wants to talk about this. What do you guys think?\n\nUpdate:  Since this seemed to really resonate with fellow grad students and some  faculty in this sub I decided to expand it and post it on medium.\n\n[https://brooks3532.medium.com/academia-is-in-deep-denial-about-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-its-students-and-faculty-db15ffcf910f](https://brooks3532.medium.com/academia-is-in-deep-denial-about-the-impact-of-the-pandemic-on-its-students-and-faculty-db15ffcf910f)\n\nI really want to encourage people to start talking about this. If you or fellow classmates feel the same please share!",

Some protests in the streets here in the US of A, but it is not a revolution as in Yemen, Iraq, Mali. We are not dealing with a government as incapable as Lebanon or Venezuela. Protesters are not being gunned down in the streets by the military (if you equate tear gas, slap your self). I'm a single dad (full time) in grad school at a top 10, with no job because of canceled child care and a full team research-intensive free labor position at a think tank. It sounds like you need to take a walk and get some fresh air. We are privileged being in school right now, while so many are wondering what corner to sleep on, how to feed their children, or watching as their entire life (business) goes down the drain. \n\nGet on with your life, don't be a B word, and keep your spirits up. We all hate this situation, but frankly the majority of the world is in a hell of a worse spot then any of us.",

It's like they think all of their students live in the English countryside, not needing work, and just studying in their spare time. Furthermore, Academia has aligned itself with money-making schemes that make it resemble a corporation rather than a collection of individuals. Hence, why they have little incentive to treat students more than worker bees or slaves. But I'm just thinking aloud....",

I don't feel like I'm making meaningful progress on my thesis, I'm unable to stay focused enough to complete assignments, and the lack of social interaction / structure altogether is zapping me of the will to really be **in it** and work consistently toward my degree. It's like many people have already said--the topic of covid and how hard everything is has become tiresome, and if you just keep verbalizing it you sound like a broken record (or worse, a do-nothing complainer while other people are out there \\*doing something about it\\*). I'll probably have to talk to my advisor and be honest about how little I've accomplished since we last met (virtually, sometime in September), but this would be the umpteenth time I've done that over the course of the pandemic, and I'm ashamed. *Because* no one talks about it (and to be fair, where would they talk about it anyway, there's no real casual conversation or impromptu sharing of personal details anymore), it's impossible to know what anyone else in my lab is really going through, what their day looks like, how productive they are, how much they're struggling/thriving, etc. But it seems like everyone else is making progress except me.

Take it from someone wrapping up their PhD after just over 6 year in this environment as a chronically ill student: people's behavior in covid and the clearly toxic work culture that compels people to violate spacing rules, masking rules, or work insane hours during an extremely stressful time etc is 100% in line with the academia I've experienced thus far. The increased work load, expectations, guilt tripping etc were all my experience prior to the pandemic. When you are in a position that makes typical academia 12-hour-a-day slave labor difficult or are not the typical student (or both), they suddenly expect more from you. This is a common experience for chronically ill people, women, POC, etc.",

I just thought it was crazy to even encourage people to go through that stress EARLY before they've even had a chance to start their project, during a pandemic, and during all the civil unrest that was happening at the beginning of the summer.",

You say that the world is on fire and professors are piling on the work, expecting you to keep up, and that this is a problem. There is a lot to unpack in your post. The world is very different than last year - things are in fact very bad. But we aren't in a major war, you can get all of the supplies you need at the grocery store, and you happen to be plugged into an organization which is continuing to demand excellence and produce what are on average high performing human beings who are very good for society (and probably provides you with pretty good healthcare). Universities have always had problems managing student mental health, but you knew that before covid-19 hit, and I don't mean that to sound as shitty as it does. It sounds to me like you are focusing so deeply on how bad this all is, and how unfair it all is, that you are failing to recognize the unique opportunity that we in the academic world have to still make real progress during this craziness.  You \\*can\\* handle the workload, that is why you were accepted. Why \\*won't\\* you find refuge in your work? Many people don't even have that, and wish they did. Everyone is struggling right now, and as always, you can embrace it or you can complain about it. The results of each tactic are not surprising.\n\nThere are some unique statements you have made, though. You live alone and have moved 5 times since January, including living in motels?  You seem to be saying you're doing all of your work from home, and your whole post is about struggling with mental health during all of this. Your professors aren't wrong - speak to a therapist. You have had a stranger ride through the pandemic than average. There is nothing wrong with doing so, and it is a great resource designed for people exactly in your current mindset. This paragraph x1000%. Do it.\n\nAre you getting outside for walks and exercise? Maintaining a healthy diet? Vitamins? Those are not just empty statements to brush off the way you feel. You have many tools at your disposal. Use them all.",

Clealry you haven't experienced what OP is talking about.\n\nTherapy is genuine advice, but \"walking\", \"healthy diet\", \"vitamins\", are all not cures to living through chaos. Those are things that may help you get through the day, but they're not going to help you fix any serious mental health problems. And therapy is not as easily accessible as admin makes it seem. It often takes month to see a therapist, so you just sit there suffering in the meantime. This is exactly what OP is talking about.",

You may end up looking like an ass.\n\nOf course diet and exercise are closely associated with mental health. If there is a wait to call a therapist, you should get on that waiting list right away.\n\nEdit - this is tautological, but may need to be said again. You have the handles to control your life that you have. You may want other handles, but you don't have them. You are hurting yourself if you do not take advantage of the handles you have.",

Not going to solve people suffering from serious mental health issues from the trauma we've all gone through this year. I think most people try to exercise and eat healthy when they can, as well as get mental health help as quickly as they can, but again, what OP was saying is that people in academia need to understand that it's not that easy to do all that when you're depressed, anxious, etc. And most importantly, having empathy would be great!",

It's like \"Y'all expect us to prepare for Actual University comprehensive exams by studying at Zoom U while the world is a colossal dumpster fire and also pick a lab for the next 5-7 years by random guessing?\" and it feels like the university's blabbering about mental health is performative.",

It is coming up on 8 months since the pandemic first shut my university down and is showing no signs of relenting any time soon. If I am going to be continue being in graduate school, it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to just cut the expectations for classwork and research just because we have to work from home (assuming the research is even possible with the restrictions.) The funding isn\u2019t there to give everyone a year extension on their appointments and doing a lesser degree/thesis ultimately feels like shooting myself in the foot. I hate working from home and my productivity has suffered at times, but I have to remind myself they are actually paying me to sit down and do work and I am privileged to have a stable job during this shit show. The whole situation is fucked but sometimes you just have to suck it up. Unpopular opinion maybe?",

I think the role of 'therapy' or taking 'refuge in work' is a similar solution, a band-aid over a much more serious problem. \n\nGenuine academics who care about their students' development are few and far between, and the 'publish or perish' culture has turned academia into a predatory system that preys on the ideas and aspirations of graduate students.",

Students have been admitted to this program for this year, and no provisions are being made to accommodate potentially being locked out of the labs again. Students are being encouraged to do practical based theses like there\u2019s no chance of another lockdown.

Half the classes have no interaction, it's not like the professors could not do zoom or teams, they just do not want to. Or you are having a zoom with your advisor or professor and they are looking away from the screen and shaking their heads at one of their kids or spouses, no real privacy either....",

Whether it's a professor who tweets about Black Lives Matter only to fetishize their PoC students, one who preaches about the importance of diversity but mocks students with accents, faculty who claim they understand the struggles of low income folks but then insist on you burying yourself in your work, it happens a lot. \n\nThe election has been hard on me as a LGBT person, in addition to the pandemic, but I've only gotten dumbass \"advice\" kind of like what you talked about. \"Try not to think about it\" or \"Maybe focusing on your research would help\" is a dumbass thing to say when folks are worried about their fundamental rights taken away. My research directly relates to the election... It's even more galling when this advice comes from folks who, demographically, tend to do pretty well regardless who's in power. I mean, bless your heart you mean well, but sit TF down. \n\nWhat bothers me even more is that I am in a program that closely relates to political science! I get not having something to say, in which case say nothing. It's really bothersome to me when people say \"I understand\" when they clearly do not.",

In the US a Harvard study saw it over 3 times more likely graduate students experienced mental health issues than other Americans, https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/#:~:text=A%20recent%20Harvard%20study%20concluded,mental%20health%20disorders%20and%20depression.&text=Most%20people%20probably%20lump%20doctoral,such%20as%20law%20or%20medicine. Covid has only exacerbated this issue and many people who actually run the school are pretty disconnected from the students as they are mostly administrators and not educators. Honestly it's hard to say how much the administration cares for students aside from bringing in Grant money, paying tuition, and boosting the schools educational stats. My advisor is more understanding especially as he is a new professor and recently was in school himself, but he doesn't control the major school policies. All schools are different but this is the feel I've gotten from most of my friends at other institutions too. Sadly, academia is another large ivory tower along with this most admins are accountable to their board of trustees. Most at my school are associated with large private entities like Warner Bros, CNN, etc, but clearly a group who really are probably just trying to make money off of their stake in the school",

For those doing purely administrative work, it might be a case of just downloading the appropriate VPN and Duo software, but for people like us who work closely with students, there have been zero support in how we can actually effectively meet with students remotely. It wasnt even a matter of, \"hey guys, here are some ways you can use existing infrastructure to work with students.\" there was basically nothing and it took me 3 months to figure things out.\n\nPersonal vent but we've also been paying parking this whole time. Basically if you stop your parking, you're put at the back of the queue and your original parking lot is not guaranteed. And when asked about it, the response was that parking is what's keeping us employed. They could issue us all refunds on parking but it means having to lay off people. It didn't seem like a big deal 3 months ago, but I've effectively been paying $80 a month to keep a parking space for the last 9 months.\n\nIt feels like we're getting the good end of the deal because we get to keep our jobs. Sure. But we're not without empathy and we're trying our best despite the lack of support from upper management. Not to mention we're also having to deal with our own kids having online school.",

So at my institutions our pass/fail during normal times can\u2019t count for undergrad or grad requirements. Due to the pandemic the university changed that rule so any student who took a pass/fail during spring 2020 now has a notation attributing the change to COVID and it now counts for requirements.",

Not always but often. At the graduate student level many are going to be career academia. They help set the tone of academia moving forward. Those that go into industry set the tone for the industry. The contributions new generations of workers bring is huge. Is it a quick fix, absolutely not. However I will say Faculty set the tone for their classes. I have students who have flexible faculty who are revitalizing the way they test and give assignments. Then I have students who have faculty who just took their normal syllabus and added more reading/ writing to \u201cmake up for\u201d the in person connection. Nothing can make up for conversation, it\u2019s not possible. I think everyone is trying their best, but I also think as an industry we have never had to deal with widespread burnout, and how to handle it at a macro level. Telling students to reach out for help but not being able to/willing to accommodate the requests they need to be successful is a problem. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I will say this, the average case of burnout takes 6mo-2years (conservatively) to heal, with proactive and reactive intervention. We need to remember that for many graduate and undergraduate students they are uniquely susceptible to burnout, and many of the methods to create a recovery plan are not available to them. I.e. finding a different job, managing external expectations, boundaries for a work/life/school balance. This is an industry issue. One that we need to look at fixing.",
