Then the path to that end will not only be clearer, but far easier to tread. \n\nThe good grad programs will try to identify students who have a goal for themselves that the graduate program's strengths can help them each.",

Either way I\u2019d eventually like to get a PhD and teach at a university, so I\u2019m not overly worried about the job side of things (especially given I\u2019ll have a qualifying law degree to fall back on)",

I guess you have to find out which one of the topics will be less ponderous to you after 30-40 years of working in that field. Ideally you would be able to utilize both skill sets in your work but that is not always a given.",
