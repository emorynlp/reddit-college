  "text": "I'm a college student applying for grad school in the fall.  I have a former employer who might be able to write a letter but most graduate programs in my major strongly prefer or require that at least two of the letters be from professors.  I currently have none in mind.  I have professors whose classes I did well in and enjoyed but I don't know them and they don't know me on a personal level.  The advice is always to go to office hours but I have no idea what to say since I never actually have questions.  I try my best to participate in class as required for that part of the grade but I'm not good at that either because I'm super introverted and awkward so tend to be the quiet one.  I guess the only thing I have going for me is that I attend every class and get good grades.  I also spent the last 2 semesters remote due to COVID which just made me more anonymous to my professors. Is it appropriate to ask for a LOR from a professor whom I've never spoken to one on one outside of class?  Would they just tell me that they don't know me well enough to do so?  Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Many of us had to ask profs that we dont know very well. If they dont feel like they can write you one, they will simply tell you so, dont worry about rejection and just ask.\n\nDo send out your cv with the email so the prof knows more about you. And you can suggest to them that you can help them write a draft they can work on, they are more likely to say yes if they dont have to write on up from scratch",

Do you still have the final version with their feedback?\n\nSend them a copy with your request. That allows them to refresh their memory on the work that you did in the class. That work is what's important. Not that you *know* your professor personally.",
