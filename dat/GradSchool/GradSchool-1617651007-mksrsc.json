  "text": "Genuine question to everyone. My graduate program offers almost no mentoring support and without a ton of searching, it's almost impossible to figure out what the graduation requirements are.\n\nOn top of all this, we've had multiple faculty members \"disappear\" from the program due to misconduct and get put on administrative leave. Other graduate students have committed actual crimes against each other like assault or stalking and the rest of us were case witnesses to these things and had to help report to the police to make it stop.\n\nJust the work would've been hard enough but I feel that my program environment is unreconcilably dangerous at this point.\n\nHas anyone else been utterly traumatized by grad school? How do you escape the toxicity?\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the perspective. I've been in this environment for so long that I thought I was weak for asking about this. I'm post-proposal ABD so I've decided to just push through and graduate ASAP and then never talk to anyone from here again. \n\nEdit 2: I'm also going to warn any prospectives who will talk to me to avoid. It's the least I can do.",

      "text": "No, grad school should absolutely not be this traumatic. My grad program was fantastic and I feel like I won the lottery sometimes. \n\nEveryone was EXTREMELY supportive (students and faculty alike). I never felt scared asking for help. All professors make themselves readily available to grad students. My advisor scheduled weekly meetings for us to chat. There was no micromanaging which was great, but faculty were more than willing to help you whenever you needed it. There was also no hounding committee members to review your paper. You give them a deadline (usually 2 weeks) and they all get back to you within that deadline with great comments. \n\nMental health was recognized as being very important. My advisor strongly recommended I work Monday to Friday from 9-5 and that's it. She also recommended I take about 3 weeks of vacation per year. This is what most grad students did from my experiences (the ones that worked in a lab had a bit longer schedules, but most of us didn't work in a lab). \n\nThere were also great opportunities to present at national and international conferences. I had the pleasure of presenting at an international conference. \n\nThe environment wasn't toxic at all. And I really wish all grad programs were like that. The cut-throat attitude is insane.",

My program definitely lied about offering a lot of their courses (i.e. 80% of your \"classes\" have to be arranged as an independent study), plus when I arrived the guidance for how to form a committee and how to pass your comps was \"email people with similar interests and ask if they want to join your committee, then just ask your committee when you're ready to hold comps and make sure you do it by X number of years.\" Also, you have to reapply for half-funding every year and it may or may not come with medical insurance depending on if they feel like giving you a TA half-line or an adjunct half-line. ETA also my program has literally no \\*actual\\* faculty members and everyone just teaches classes in the program but works for different depts.  \n\n\nSo my program is pretty shitty in a lot of ways, but your situation sounds even worse and concerning in terms of physical safety as well as mental health. As others have said, if you talk to an ombudsman they hold everything you say in strict confidentiality and even if they can't help they know whom to contact so you can get help...Also, keep a record of any and every email exchanged with your dept about these issues, with the police, etc. so that you have evidence in case it's needed to submit to, say, an ombudsman, union, etc.",

It sounds like this department is actively preventing students from succeeding with its bad social climate and administrative practices. If you\u2019re not going to be able to finish with the degree you want, it\u2019s time to look into a transfer (and sooner rather than later). But if you believe you can adjust your expectations and your relationship to academia, keep your head down, and get through it to get the degree without accruing more emotional trauma on the way, then stick it out since it\u2019s such a highly regarded program. (That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do myself, anyway. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd)\n\nEdit: I saw in your other comment that you got through quals. In my department, it\u2019s fairly easy to get distance from the program as you write your dissertation, since it\u2019s largely a solo enterprise anyway. Is that a possibility for you? (And the most important thing for this is that you have a committee who won\u2019t screw you over in the end, even if they\u2019re not very helpful throughout the process.)",

I think that while some departments have relatively healthy environments (the environment where I did my master's was much healthier), any organization that relies on extremely strict hierarchy (ie most grad programs) will inevitably be rife with at least some abuse of power. Especially in venues where the perceived stakes of every interaction with superiors are very high.",

We're all adults here and we're capable of figuring out what needs to be done ourselves, so no one should expect all information to be handed to them on a silver platter, but it shouldn't be *too* hard to find your graduation requirements. I'd expect it to take me ~30-60 minutes of searching through my university's ordinances, which is significantly less time than it takes to figure out rental laws or tax codes. \n\nIt's normal for any department or place of employment to have a few assholes, and maybe you'd be unlucky enough to have a major asshole who commits something as serious as assault, but if the majority of the people around you are terrible then that's not normal. With that many bad apples I wouldn't trust their judgement in admitting students. They might be admitting bad/incompetent students because they are also bad/incompetent. So not only do you want to leave because the place is toxic, but you also want to leave because it won't reflect well on you to carry this reputation with you.  Your department is likely already well-known to be terrible within your field.",
