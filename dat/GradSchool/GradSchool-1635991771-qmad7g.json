  "text": "I'm trying to get into an engineering masters program, but my undergrad GPa was too low for the cutoff. It was recomended I take 3 grad classes (1 each semester) to show I can handle the work. I passed the first one with a high grade, no issues at all. The second class I thought i was okay in, but now I've been late on several assignments and am lost on the final project. I am not sure if I can salvage a passing grade in the next month. I have talked with the TA but I am still unable to understand basic skills of the material. I havent been able to dedicste as much time to the class due to work, and I am worried not passing a class will keep my out from being able to apply into the program",
