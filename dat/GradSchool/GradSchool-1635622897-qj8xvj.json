  "title:": "How can I make my resume/CV/personal statement look good with little going for me aside from a decent GPA?",
  "text": "I am currently a senior undergraduate student graduating in May with a BS in Psychology, and I am looking to get my application ready this month for a MA in Clinical Mental Health Counseling at Northern Arizona University. I am feeling very intimidated and discouraged about assembling my resume and CV because aside from having a decent GPA (3.46), it really feels like I don\u2019t have much going for me. \nAside from the internship I am currently at, I have no relevant work experience or volunteer work (I\u2019ve worked at a movie theater throughout college), I have no research experience because my lab in behavioral intervention class isn\u2019t until next semester. And I have no scholarships, awards, or anything relevant to add to my resume and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not going to get into a Masters program because of it. Help! How do I make my resume competitive and stand out? Thanks in advance!",

Don't focus on the grade - focus on what the goal was, what skills were required, and what actions you performed.",
