  "text": "I am currently working for a defense contractor at a US Air Force base as a software engineer. Now, I am thinking about applying to more big name defense contractors, like Lockheed Martin, as a software engineer. If I were able to get a job offer from Lockheed Martin, how much would it help my grad school applications for computer science next year?\n\nI checked to see if the grad schools I want to attend have alumni from both my current defense contracting company and Lockheed Martin. My current defense contractor has no employee alumni that attended any of the masters programs that I want to attend whereas Lockheed Martin has thousands of its alumni who attended those masters programs.\n\nMy current defense contracting company would pay for my masters program as long as I stay one year after my last tuition reimbursement. As far as I can tell from reading information from the internet, Lockheed Martin would be able to pay for 90-95% of my masters programs, but I would have to stay for two years after my last tuition reimbursement.\n\nFor masters programs in computer science, would working for Lockheed Martin help me a lot more than working for my current defense contracting company? I know what I work on matters, but I think where I work might have a lot of importance based on how many alumni from my current employer and Lockheed Martin attended the masters programs I want to attend.",
