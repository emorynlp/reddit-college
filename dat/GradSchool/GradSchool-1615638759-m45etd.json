My fam had to use food stamps when I was really little, subsidized lunch in grade school, and finally stopped renting when I hit high school. I have a scar on my elbow caused by falling onto the floor vent in the trailer home we lived in for a while. The family car was my grandparents old car. Wendy's was a treat. Vacations involved pretending I didn't need a bed for cheaper rates.\n\nI mean, I'm not like.... A lot more elite now or something. Lol. I just don't have to use food stamps and get rooms with beds enough for my kids too. When I can actually afford to travel with them.\n\nSo. Are we all \"elites\"?

Monetarily, I would bet that the vast majority of PhD holders are somewhere in the middle class, where losing their job can be a pretty devastating blow. A tiny percentage of them hold any real power in society (which, IMO, is what makes someone an elite). But having a grad degree does grant you a good amount of cultural privilege - you're likely more comfortable navigating professional spaces, and socializing with other middle class folks. Unfortunately, the right need someone to blame for all of society's ills, and it's way easier to point fingers at the \"evil SJW professors\" than at the billionaires of the world.",

Education is a huge part of class, so education allows us to move up in class. There is also a certain amount of elitism associated with grad school, and many people in grad school, at least historically, have been economically in the elite class. Common perception may be a bit behind reality that we\u2019re not all elites, but the reality also is that many people with graduate education are elite. When you look at many professors, they are out of touch with tenure, guaranteed income.\n\nBasically, yes, grad school is becoming more accessible and less elite, and many of us are broke AF, but it has a long history of being for elites and still contains many, so people are going to keep seeing it that way",

      "text": "I think this misunderstands how these people view \"elite\". It isn't a class issue for them. Keep in mind a lot of people railing at the elite also see Donald Trump, a self proclaimed billionaire CEO who lived until recently in a golden penthouse in manhattan as \"one of them\".\n\nI think when people bitch at \"the elite\" what they are really complaining about are people in professions and positions they perceive to be exclusionary and prestigious. Academics get hate because our position is seen as \"prestigious\" and some sort of exclusive club that turns deserving people away.\n\nMost of the modern populist \"anti elite\" figures seem to have a common theme in their past of being excluded from some prestigious club or thing they wanted in on.  For Donald Trump it was the manhattan rich social circles that turned him away. For Steve Bannon it was Hollywood producers and Tech CEOs that said no. For Tucker Carlson he was rejected by the CIA (and is still salty about it to the point he still includes it as a big part of his biography). for Charlie Kirk he was rejected by West Point and for Jason Chaffetz it was the US Secret Service that turned him down.\n\nIf you actually look at the salaries for some of these professions, it isn't that much. The CIA and Secret Service don't pay that well, and at most  you'd be making low six figures. Most of the time you'd be making something like $60K a year if that. Carlson in particular makes many times more at Fox News than what he would have made at the CIA. But it's not the money that breeds his resentment there, it's the idea that he was excluded from some thing he wanted in on that would have been seen as at least somewhat prestigious had he got in.\n\nThis is also the reason so many of these same people obsess so much about affirmative action: it isn't really about class tensions, it's about feeling like \"somebody else took your spot\" in a club you wanted in that you felt you were more entitled to. This is why Steve Bannon, despite railing against the liberal elite, loves to brag about the fact he went to Harvard. He \\*does\\* in fact possess an elitist attitude, he just doesn't like the fact he's been excluded from some of the clubs because that hurts his ego.\n\nI seem to remember hearing comments from some extended family about how they thought \"all those liberals were giving away spots at Harvard to those minorities when they didn't deserve it\" with affirmative action, and that is ultimately where this \"liberal elite\" sentiment really comes from. It's a sense of entitlement to inclusion in a club that they are absolutely not entitled to, and blaming others for lack of admission into it instead of admitting they aren't that special as a means of preserving ego.",

Making students listen to your perspective (and hopefully form their own) in order to pass a class they need for their degree is a lot more power than most people have.

There are a lot of seemingly wealthy people who are broke, but their station in life places them in the crowd of the elite, which meant access and opportunities. So, I don't think it's so much about the money in the bank, as much as the respect and access. \n\nYou're in school with people who will ultimately be in influential seats that will allow you to skip the line due to their relationship with you, your institution of study, or even just respect for your degrees. Even just an insider providing you information about how the system functions puts you ahead of most out in the market. When I think about the majority of Americans that did not go/finish college and what it's like applying to jobs, it's disheartening. \n\nOn another angle, I feel the elite term is also meant to highlight a form of study that came from books and not from real life- an out of touch, safe way of observing life without having to get your hands \"dirty\". There will be members of the true elite that will not respect you because you earned your money and didn't inherit it and have a similar childhood or experience growing up. So I agree there are varying classes within the elite,  and wish America would not lump everyone together for one experience.",

      "text": "I think these people are getting hung up on semantics. Of course it is possible for a grad student to embody \"elitism\" in looking down on those with less education. It is possible for damn near anyone to be an elitist, some guy with the luxury trim version of your car might be just as arrogant about your car being the base model. The \"elitist\" attitude should not be confused with actual \"elites\".\n\nWho are the actual elites? I'd argue the ones in the upper echelon of society with undue influence on its workings and excessive wealth. So who are these people? (They're a surprisingly insular group).\n \nLauren Rivera at Northwestern spent a large portion of her career studying them. Specifically the hiring practices of America's white-shoe firms (the most elite accounting, legal, investing institutions). She coined the term \"Culture Matching\" to describe the process by which these institutions recruit the next generation of elites. ([Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0003122412463213)) \n\nShe found that these firms were incredibly specific in their searches. They wanted people from very specific schools (almost always HPYS and Penn for business), very specific majors, with very specific backgrounds and hobbies, etc. Fitting in with the culture was far more important than grades or skills. While interviewing someone at a recruiting fair she watched them toss the resume of an Asian guy from MIT who was near the top of his class. They causally explained that he wasn't a good \"fit\". Yes, surely racism is a large part of this, classism, sexism, and sectarianism too, but these folks were so specific they looked for the right hobbies and interests. They were just as quick to discard people for not matching those requirements; in fact one specifically wanted young white men from Yale who enjoyed mountain climbing, while another specifically rejected \"active\" / sporty people.\n\nRivera's work is way outside of my field, but always fascinating to read as it is a look into an almost alien world right next door. \n\nBy these standards, most grad students are not \"elite\" at all. In fact, I'd argue there is no path to becoming \"elites\" for the majority of us. No credentials, no accomplishments, no work success will make up for you not being their specific fit. Even if you or I became tenured professors at Berkeley or resident physicians at Hopkins, we'd never be seen by these folks as part of their group.\n_________\n\n**TL;DR:** No, looking at Rivera's research, elites are very insular group and no educational credential will make you one of them.",

I was raised to believe that pretty much my only option was joining the army. The last vacation I went on was 20 years ago when I was 10 years old and a relative flew us out to visit. \n\nBeing \"elite\" in the context of grad school has nothing to do with money; it has to do with the fact that higher education is something that a lot of people don't have access to. Growing up in a school district that had semi-quality educators is a privilege. Being able to afford the time and money (even if that money is a loan) is a privilege. Being able to live with family while you're in school (if you could) is a privilege. Having people that support you emotionally is a privilege. And the degree that that privilege grants us allows us to look better on our resume and open better doors faster. \n\nUntil we address the systems of inequity that make higher education so inaccessible there are always going to be people who think we're elitist. If that's jarring to you, you should work to change those systems. Otherwise, it shouldn't bother you that people feel that way because it doesn't diminish from the work you put in to get to where you are.

If you end up working with or forming relationships with non academics who have this understanding (a LOT of them do), you will have to come to terms with this inner conflict.\n\nAlso some food for thought. What do you think about the fact that you seem to have been unaware of this mentality by non-academia folks?

There is some truth that there are \u201celitists\u201d in academia (just as there are in most fields), but certainly not everyone, or even most people now, in academia are really \u201celite\u201d.\n\n> So. Are we all \"elites\"? I feel like I'm one surprise bill away from poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s a culture war dog whistle. Colleges and universities have been a huge target in many culture war subjects, so using the term in a pejorative way and associating it with colleges serves to create a sentiment where it can automatically keep some from listen to an argument because the \u201celites\u201d are perceived as bad and cannot be trusted. So even if they speak the truth, you cannot believe it. \n\nThe ironic thing is that many of the people who stoke these sentiments often have better academic pedigrees than most of us ever will. Yes, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, please tell us about the evil institutions that were crucial for your success and ability to become US senators. And actually, are there any federal legislators without a degree? Still, unfortunately, that attitude filters down to ordinary folks who may very well have have felt ignored by and condescend by some academic or some one with a college degree, at some point. Again, I think most of this use of the term \u201celite\u201d is meant as a smear, often for unfounded reasons, but it should also be a reminder to all of us not to be an asshole to people who do have less education or fewer credentials than us. Sometimes, you are gonna have to pull rank, but there are good and bad ways to go about doing so.",

      "text": "I don\u2019t think the characterization of all those who pursue higher ed as \u201celites\u201d is useful or in good faith, especially since they seem to decrying political differences more than anything else. \n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that having a graduate degree is an immense privilege in almost any country (I would argue any college degree is a great privilege when you look at the high school/college salary gap). Even education aside, one\u2019s degree status is a very reliable predictor for future income and socioeconomic class. Moreover, so many things are becoming polarized where education status is a reliable predictor (especially politics), to the point where university graduates have *very different* interests and priorities than those who did not attend university.\n\nAnd while there are those who come from poorer backgrounds or even remain poor after a university degree (I myself was a financial aid kid), it\u2019s still a privilege in the same sense that white privilege is still a thing even though there are white people in poverty. \n\n\nThis is all the context for why someone would make a derogatory remark about people who attend university in the first place. It doesn\u2019t excuse or justify it, but these socioeconomic differences as well as polarization along education lines are part of the cause of tension between those who do attend university and those who don\u2019t. This hostility is not just because they hate the idea of learning or whatever. \n\n\nPersonally I also think \u201celite\u201d is an apt descriptor for myself and my personal colleagues given I pursued a PhD at a well regarded university; there is definitely a bubble in terms of the lives we lead that is incredibly hard to pierce. My immediate interests are not the same as one who lives in a poor rural town. Even though I grew up a financial aid kid, by virtue of having a STEM PhD I have an extremely high likelihood  of a solid and secure middle class life for the rest of my life without having to keep clawing my way up the socioeconomic ladder or constantly fearing homelessness. \n\nNot to mention that those who come from poorer or \u201cless refined\u201d backgrounds often face prejudices in university and graduate school. \u201cElitism\u201d is a very real phenomenon. Also, in sociological terms, the American \u201celite\u201d tend to interact and so on in higher education.",

Just having parents who are willing to let you live with them during college or even between college and grad school, to lend you money for your first month's rent until your financial aid and/or stipend kick in etc. is something most don't have. My parents, even being uneducated, pushed to make sure I did well in school and supported me at the very least morally when they couldn't materially. \n\nMost of the kids I grew up with didn't have nearly the support network I had.

In the U.S. (it's important to distinguish this from other countries) following WWII, there was default deference to -- and admiration of -- expertise. The Vietnam era shook that foundation, and Reaganites eventually threaded the needle on being powerful people saying experts were the problem. They did that not by questioning expertise per se but by separating people into dainty elites -- and tying them to the liberal policies they tended to advocate -- and \"hard-working Americans guided experience and common sense\", which happened to work as a way to combine the working class/white populists and anyone reflexively against liberal policies (the socially and economically conservative) into a voting bloc.\n\nFast forward to now, and the use of \"elite\" isn't even parsed anymore. It's simply shorthand for people with the power to change things in a liberal direction, even if it's being a poor grad student -- you're part of a powerful force we call higher education. Beyond that, elite a nonsense word in the U.S. now, because the people bashing \"the elite\" were more often born rich, white, went to law school, belong to country clubs, etc. and everything else a dictionary definition of societal elite would have you picture.\n\nIt reminds me to recommend the books of Heather Hendershot, who's done great work on the various iterations of 20th century conservatism as it negotiated how to feel about elitism. http://www.heatherhendershot.com/home/category/books/",

The coal plants and logging factories are shutting down or automating, and the jobs those families have relied on for generations are gone. To get a job, the young people have to leave the community, go to a city, and get a degree. And they don't go back to the community ever again because there are no jobs there that pay enough to cover their student loan repayments.",

Having a college degree meant I had the option to teach in my subject area while taking Ed courses (not true in every state). This meant I could work full time in a safe and respected profession with good benefits, make enough money to  squeak by with a roof over our head, and still be able to spend time with my kids after school and on weekends. I needed support in other ways - the fact that kids in a single salary home headed by a new teacher qualify for free medical benefits from the state says a lot. My kids and I were using hand me downs and thrift store clothes and furnishings for their whole childhood, and when community members gave away free food I went and got some for us too.  But bottom line, that college degree saved our butts. Best thing my parents ever did for me, was expect me to go to college.",

People will look at you very differently depending on if you have a degree or hardly finished high school - even if you don't try to leverage that. The kind of people you've surrounded yourself with over your doctorate are also unlikely to be average, giving you likely access to a high impact network. If you ever have kids, they will also be treated very differently in eg. Schools or kindergarten if people get to be aware of you having a PhD. \n\nPlus, of course, intellectual doors. I think it's easy to forget as most of our immediate network is also easily capable of doing so, but some of the skills like critical thinking etc. just aren't that common/well developed across the average population. \n\nI'm sure there are many more, and I'm sure that they also don't immediately matter to you when you are struggling with unemployment. It's hard to notice these things when you can't guarantee your own security, and that really sucks, so pls don't think I'm saying that your situation is \"even\" because of other privileges. But more generally, it is just not quite right to say that just because some PhDs don't make you very employable, they don't carry privileges and open doors.",

I assume that everyone struggled and worked very hard to get here, since getting here pretty much requires that. At least in my field, graduate admission is so competitive, you pretty much need everything to have a chance of getting in.\n\nI was pointing out that we have privilege in the sense that we have the personal capacity to meet the minimum requirements to get into graduate school, which most people don't have. This is likely our cognitive ability as well as our capacity to continually put forth a lot of effort over a long period of time. \n\nI guess it depends on what your definition of privilege is though. Most people take it as advantages that you did not earn, and it's not like people choose to be smart or not, or choose to be driven or not, or choose not have personal barriers (e.g. depression) that hold them back, so in that sense, the things that let us perform well enough to get into graduate school were unearned (although our grades/experience/recommendations that did certainly were, and often were by an extraordinary effort). I think that we are all very fortunate to be able to get here (whether coming here was a good choice or not...), even if we did not come from advantaged backgrounds. \n\nI think of myself as extraordinarily privileged, even though my parents are both poor, never finished high school, and live super-rural. Sure, I did not have the material or social advantages that most of my peers had, but thing is, I didn't need them to succeed, and I think that is super privileged.",

Or if not elitism, a certain sense of being out of touch with students\u2019 struggles, or the life of people who aren\u2019t like you.\n\nA couple of students were struggling because sadly their laptops were pretty old. I was struggling for a while as well and was just hoping my laptop could hold on until I found enough money to buy a new one (since I couldn\u2019t fix it). \n\nOur lab is presentation heavy and it can be inconvenient for students during quals too if laptops are a little glitchy. (I don\u2019t think my laptop issues ever became very noticeable so my PI wasn\u2019t aware.)\n\nI thought my prof was pretty tone deaf when I heard him say \u201chey, why don\u2019t you buy a new one?\u201d to the others. I mean, maybe he had suggested that they try to fix the laptop first and I didn\u2019t hear. However, I found this a little elitist / out of touch in general because it presumes they have money to burn on a new laptop. Also, I live in an area with limited public transportation and it would be so hard to go to school here without access to a car.\n\nAhhh idk, maybe I\u2019m not even using the term elitist right. It could just be a prof/student divide rather than a class struggle issue.",

It was just a cringe moment that stuck with me.\n\nFor a bit of context, he lives modestly but seems to be way too into buying electronics. His office is filled with 4+ monitors, and our lab has many of his old laptops which we hook up to various instruments. So maybe he said that as his habit is to just to buy electronics consistently when a good one is released? \n\nAnyway I feel I\u2019ve written too much about this  topic already haha",

You might not have noticed it, but you have moved into a different society and a different \"class\" just by going to university. You are no longer the same as you were growing up, and your particular mix of privilege and underprivilege has changed. University is an added privilege.\n\nPeople in more rural communities and those not served by universities see that privilege but lack such fundamental vocabulary and knowledge of the system to adequately express that disdain.\n\nThey call us all elites *because* they aren't privy to how the educated class works or its lingo.",

Then if you want to propose conclusions that require that Y *not* be true for a certain X specimen, the burden is on you to really prove that this particular X does not have Y. After all that work, you look back and say \"wow, all that justification required seems kind of extreme/outsized compared to the true very non-zero probability that it was not-Y\".

About 1/3 of households in the U.S. make less than $30,000 per year, and that's households, not individuals. And just the U.S., too.\n\nAs far as I understood it, the point was to explain why so many people think of academics, including graduate students, as \"elites.\" I just really don't think the economic costs of grad school are the right explanation any more than people not understanding how much work grad school is.\n\nAs I said, that doesn't mean there aren't any people for whom that's the distinction, but in general...it's really much more about social expectations than economics.\n\nAnd I guess I don't know what kind of grad school you're talking about, but none of the programs I know of require any thousands of dollars for exams (many don't even require the couple hundred for the GRE any more) and *they* pay *you* to come for interviews, not the other way around. Grad school is a variable experience, though, and certainly some have higher economic costs than others. In fact, the ones that are cheaper tend to also be the ones that focus most on \"intellectual achievement,\" so the social barriers are going to be even higher in those cases compared to something like medical school or law school where maybe the economic cost is more important.",
