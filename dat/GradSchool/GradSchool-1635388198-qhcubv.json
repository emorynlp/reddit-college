  "text": "I have a question . So I took two community college courses for a very short time my senior year in high school, but then I moved to a different state because of family issues. Do these courses need to be included into my grad transcripts request? I never got to finish them because I couldn\u2019t take them at my other high school, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to look bad on admissions. Honestly these classes never even crossed my mind until now, and I forgot I had even taken them until I saw that you could be rejected admission for not delivering all transcripts. I\u2019m worried these might be W\u2019s I\u2019m transferring too, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to look bad. I had to move away because my other side of my family was extremely dysfunctional and affecting my health to the point to where I was suicidal at this time in my life.",

      "text": "The best answer will come from the specific programs you are applying to, but 99% of the time it\u2019s safe to bet that yes, they need to be included. Grad schools often need transcripts from ALL post secondary institutions you have attended - I\u2019d include any and all post-secondary transcripts you have.",
