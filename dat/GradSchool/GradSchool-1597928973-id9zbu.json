The problem is often just that one's thoughts are not fully organized yet.  If you're getting writer's block, try outlining and/or refining that outline.  \n\nMost of us are pretty good at writing 5-10 paragraph essays by the time we get to graduate school.  If you're good enough at it, you're used to shooting from the hip and just ... writing.  It works because your thoughts are already pretty organized, so you can pick your way through a few paragraphs naturally.  The thing is, inspiration like that doesn't scale.  Outlining does -- you can use it both to organize your thoughts and to separate the different parts of your larger work.  \n\nThat last aspect (separation) lets you write one part of your article or dissertation, while the other is still \"shaking out\".  That's important because at the dissertation scale you actually *can't* keep everything in your head all at once to let it shake out.  Practically nobody can just sit down and write even a rough draft dissertation from start to finish -- and if it were possible, we'd just set aspirations higher.    So you have to be able to push aside most of the work in order to focus on the details in any one section.  That is what an outline is for.",

          "text": "I needed to read this. \n\nYear 3 (2018/19) was a headache but it is for everyone: passed comps, thought about potential projects, had a prospectus presentation--it didn't go super well but they basically said, \"you're super smart and hard working. Not everyone has a perfect thesis plan their first go, let's keep at it.\"\n\nI felt good going into year 4. Then my PI abruptly retired for health reasons. I'm passed on to a different guy, who is nice enough but does NOT do the same kind of work as me. We spend the fall kind of back and forthing some ideas. They're not great but something. His method is not mine even a little bit, and he's nixing every attempt I make to shift towards something I cam wrap my head around. Then covid hits, and the work I'm able to get out, I'm told isn't good enough. \n\nWe don't have a plan. I don't have a thesis design, idea, etc. He's so insanely busy with so many things, that I'm way down his list of priorities. So I'm about to start year 5 without a chapter finished, without a plan for subsequent ones, and without the support structure I had for my first few years. I'm being asked to write up a chapter on a given period that we think will be a case study, but without any direction on WHAT to write about. (It's like a thesis by induction, and everyone in the dept. except my new PI thinks it's bonkers but I have NOONE else in my subfield to work with instead)\n\nI was SUCH a good student in coursework, but the last 2 years have just fucking crushed me. I feel very much like a hamster on a wheel. I work my ass off, get shut down hard, and start over. If I had 1 or 2 even crappy chapters done, I'd feel better. But I feel like I'm stuck in neutral at the starting line with time running out. So incredibly frustrating. Especially since its impossible for me to distinguish whether it's ME and something I'm doing wrong, or if it's just a bad PI fit (and if so what can I do with no alternative PIs), or if it's just that covid threw off a process that was otherwise on the right track...\n\nSorry for the rant, I just had to type it all out.",

              "text": "It's almost certainly a bad PI fit for most of it, and COVID exacerbates it. Your experience isn't atypical, and being way down on your advisor's list of priorities is, unfortunately, a realty for a lot of grad students. I had to constantly wrangle my chair and other committee members and remind them to review my chapters so that I could move on to the next one and graduate. It got to a point where they were taking so long with my chapters that I just kept on writing them and sending them off without knowing if I was going in a direction they agreed with. \n\nMy partner's committee chair was the same way, never responding to emails or getting back to her about her chapters, so she had to twiddle her thumbs for months waiting to hear back, constantly checking in and receiving no answer. \n\nAnother student's chair was a grad student's nightmare, directing her to explore this or that, wasting her time, making her write up dozens and dozens of pages on these little side adventures, and then telling her later to just remove it all because it wasn't necessary or relevant. I can only imagine her fury when being told that. \n\nAt some point, we have to put our foot down and just say no. I had to do this with committee members too, as did my partner and the other student. They ask you to explore something else or try a different methodology, and at the beginning, that's fine. You should explore things, you know? You might find something that works better. But by the fifth or sixth year of grad school, you just need to get it done and move on, and a lot of advisors just need to be told this. It may be worth having a sit-down with your PI to explain to him the reality that you're running out of time and need to graduate, and then explain what your boundaries will be, such as rejecting his insistence that you explore some other method or go into more detail on some topic or another. \n\nA good way to frame it with him might be to suggest that these are all things you can explore once the dissertation is complete, and different methods or topics could serve as a great way to expand upon your dissertation and get publications out of it. That's what worked for me and for my partner, and oftentimes, even if your advisors or PI are rigid bastards, telling them \"no\" is all it takes to narrow things down and keep things moving.",

Yeah looking again at the issues, I've very much got a case of 2 things combining to make a problem worse than the sum of its parts (covid, poor PI fit). Also, as much as I know logically that I'm not in like, trouble of them kicking me out or anything (my PI personally likes me, the whole dept does, they know my original PI's unexpected retirement is something that affected me, and above all having me not graduate is bad for rates so they have a vested interest in seeing me through)... but it still feels so incredibly worrisome because the fear of this lasting not only into an unfunded year 6 but what if year 7... it's just terrifying. I am so burned out and tired of doing this, and it still feels like I have an insurmountable amount yet to do. \n\nI appreciate the idea that I need to just say no, and also the suggestions as to how. I think I've done a good job of sort of standing up for myself in recent months, but all I got out of him was like, \"yeah PhD work can kick your butt if you let it. I'd like to see this be a productive year for you. Now go figure out that hook for your chapter, I'm not sure I see how you're going to make this compelling...\" Like, fucking christ. \n\nI'm really uncertain how best to pose the, \"bro can we just get this done?\" convo, other than that, he's hoping this initial chapter I'm working on can be a standalone article. My next chat with him I'm going to frankly say that I'm not interested in tightening it up for submission. I want to move on to chapter 2. Any additional tinkering w/ chapter 1 can be a side project, but let's please get me MOVING. (Also I'm 110% NOT going academic track after this. I hate research now.  I am a good teacher and have a ton of useful skills from before coming to the PhD that could apply to many career paths. But this process has absolutely and without salvageability completely sapped me of any interest in pursuing a research career in academia. But how and when to broach that is another issue...)",

I'm glad that you're generally in a good position within the department, though, and you have it right that they have a vested interest in seeing you graduate. That also means that they have a vested interest in helping you get funding should it come to that, and that's something you can drop in your conversation with your PI. It can be as straightforward as \"I need to complete this by the end of this academic year. I cannot afford to continue unfunded. If you don't help me finish this by tightening expectations, I will be forced to leave this program and not graduate.\" You're already aware of this, but sometimes our committee members need this \"come to Jesus\" talk to get some reality slapped into them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> My next chat with him I'm going to frankly say that I'm not interested in tightening it up for submission. I want to move on to chapter 2. Any additional tinkering w/ chapter 1 can be a side project, but let's please get me MOVING. \n\nYes! This is exactly the kind of bullshit I'm talking about. It's nice that they get excited about publication possibilities, but that can come later. Let's keep it moving, shall we? A good dissertation is a done dissertation, after all. The real research work comes after that. Keep doing this kind of thing, and you might see some results when it comes to movement.\n\nI'm really sorry that this experience has destroyed any interest in research for you. The funny thing is that grad school sort of did the opposite for me. I came in really wanting to teach, then I actually fell into a research project that made me really enjoy research, and I had a couple terrible semesters with students plagiarizing that my passion for teaching just melted away. And now, where do I find myself? Fucking teaching, because writing my dissertation sapped every ounce of my motivation for doing research! I still like research, but I can't be bothered to sit down and do any of it when my current position only requires me to teach (I'm a lecturer). \n\nSo don't be too hard on yourself if you come out of grad school not wanting to research anymore. I know so many current PhDs who feel the same way. My partner also got a tenure track position, and she's said that all the inane administrative and service work they are required to do has sapped her passion for all the advocacy she used to do. Now she just does these things to get points toward tenure. Add that to zero research motivation due to grad school, slap on a pandemic, and you get a wonderful recipe for disillusionment!\n\nJust keep on your PI and emphasize that you all need to manage expectations at this point and just get things done. Drive home to him and your other committee members that no funding means no graduation. And then just take the dissertation day by day. I fully understand how insurmountable it feels right now, but consider that if you wrote just one page per day for the next 200 days, you'd have a finished product by spring break. I found breaking it down day by day like that was the only way I was able to manage the enormity of the task before me.",

Yes they have intimated that my excellent teaching record could justify giving me an easy means of finding a 6th year by just running my own class as lead instructor. So securing a 6th year of funding isn't really that hard to envision, I'm just tired. I don't WANT to spend a 6th year here, I simply cannot get out in less. \n\nAs for the page count to day count. Damn that slaps. I mean, it's impossible to perfectly gauge bc I'd still have to do all the actual research (rip archives, thx covid-- that's part of the issue is we've had to totally adjust HOW I'm looking at my area of interest since I can no longer see so much with archives closed)... but in the grand scheme that's really quite reassuring. \n\nIt's helpful to just repeat to myself that finishing in 6 is very doable once I can get over this hump. Even my PI has said it should start to snowball once I get a little bit further. And if that's true then I'm 2/3 done. (FWIW I'm a really good writer, and can work independently and quickly very well. The issue is the ideas just don't come anymore, I'm like gunshy after so throughly being shot down every time I tried over the past 2 years to propose anything)",

You'll definitely spend days where you don't write at all and have to focus on research, teaching, or other tasks, or you may just need days to not do anything at all, but don't think you're falling behind. You could not write for a week and then have one day where you hammer out ten pages, and you've not only not fallen behind on your one page per day goal, but you've actually come out ahead. But don't obsess over the one-page-per-day thing either. That was just a good way for me to put the project in perspective and helped me manage it.\n\nAnd yes, it will snowball once you get going. I think that's how I finished it. I spent the summer before my last year gathering data, and then spent most of fall writing. I stopped caring too eventually, but you'll find that not caring will give way to angry spite, and you'll finish the damn thing just to be done with it. That's enough to get you over the finish line, and that's all that matters in the end.",
