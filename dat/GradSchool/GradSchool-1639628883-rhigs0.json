  "text": "I saw on someone else's CV recently that they put being a Fulbright finalist (they got it the next year) and I was a finalist for a very competitive internship program run by a recognizable company. Should I list it in under the awards section of my CV? I didn't get it but I did go through the interview rounds so I feel finalist is honest.",

      "text": "Depends.\n\nFulbright finalist means they one the award. That definitely goes on a CV. \n\nDo you perhaps mean semifinalist? These are usually heavily advertised and also probably appropriate to put on a CV.\n\nOther finalist positions might be less so, especially if they\u2019re not advertised publicly.  NSF GRFP honorable mention is another non-award that is usually fine / good to put on your CV.",

          "text": "OP mentioned that this was for an industry internship. IIRC, at least one industrial internship program (Novartis) explicitly calls those applicants who make it through all rounds of centralized evaluation \"finalists\", pending an actual internship placement (which isn't guaranteed). I guess it's kind of analogous to Fulbright finalist status, in that you've made it through the vetting but are still pending a confirmed appointment. \n\nEither way, I certainly agree that public evidence of the award/honor status is a pretty good threshold for CV inclusion.",
