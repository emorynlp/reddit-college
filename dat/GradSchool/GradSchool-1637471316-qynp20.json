  "title:": "Asking my advisor for time off and I need help\u2026",
  "text": "For some unspecified reason, my PI only lets us take time off in single week intervals, *maybe* twice a year\u2026 it is exceptionally frustrating. I haven\u2019t had a vacation or seen my family in over two years, since before the pandemic, and I want to go home (~2k miles away). I\u2019m a 4th year grad student and I\u2019m primarily computational and capable of doing my work remotely, and I have since the pandemic started. So there are no cells to feed or experiments that will be hindered by my physical absence. A little bit more context, I am immunocompromised and not only will I be driving home (~3days) to avoid planes, but I won\u2019t be going until after the new year (January) to avoid any potential crowds caused by the holidays. I know this seems weird and it\u2019s not preferred but if it keeps me safe and I still get to see my parents idc. There really shouldn\u2019t be an issue here but I\u2019m really nervous about asking for time off because I know he will insist only a week. It\u2019s also worth noting he is seemingly constantly disappointed with me due to setbacks caused by my disability so I get the sense he thinks I don\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d time off. Could y\u2019all please help me phrase something that sounds firm and determined but also not insubordinate? I need help and any is appreciated!",

      "text": "Well that's BS (on your adviser's part). Not sure how comfortable you'd feel with this, but I'd be inclined to take a \"tell, don't ask\" approach. Maybe do it in writing so you can take the time to give/remind them of the same context you just gave us, without having the pressure of them staring you down while you make your argument. Maybe lay out some plans to show how you're going to keep up with your work obligations despite the \"extra\" (in their eyes) time off, to shift the focus from time input to work outputs. \n\nBtw not sure if it helps at all but given the specifics you provided - > 2 years with no holiday, family thousands of miles away - a longer break sounds ENTIRELY warranted. If your advisor can't see that, I hope you can find the courage to do it anyway.",

      "text": "Don't you have a work contract tho? It must specify how many days off you have per year and whether or not they are cumulative. \n\ni had a compulsory medical check up once a year and the therapist told me that i MUST take all of my vacation days not just for my mental/physical well-being, but also because they burn out at the end of a year and I'm basically loosing my paid vacation. \n\nthat being said, as an employee you're entitled to a certain number of days off, your PI has no legal right to forbid you from using it. \n\nI'd suggest you don't ask for permission l, but notify your PI in advance and ONLY through email, no verbal agreement or anything that can't be used as a record of communication.\n\nHowever, if your PI isn't a robot and actually is a human being, you may add a personal note along the lines: i know it's been tough on everyone in the past 2 years with global pandemic, and that some research have been set back. This also had a significant impact on my productivity and ability to focus, since i haven't seen my family. I'm planning on taking some vacation for a period of _____ to _____. \n\n\nI mean, if your PI doesn't understand that well-rested employee is more productive than a burnt-out employee, they must be not very bright. It's in their best interest.",
