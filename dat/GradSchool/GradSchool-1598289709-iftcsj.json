I still have neck and shoulder problems from all my lab posture issues and it's been over 6 years since I left academia...  \n\n\nI definitely discovered I had muscle knots that was causing my pain and being unable to sleep at night. Took me a few months to realize that muscles can cause THAT much pain. Lifting/weight training (whether you're a guy or a gal) was one of the few things that I think can actually heal you over time - everything else is unfortunately just temporary. I did find hard massage balls, chiro and dry needling to help though - everything else I tried when I was desperate was mostly nonsense.  \n\n\nSeriously, though. Take care of yourselves, ya'll. Grad school is just a part of the rest of your life - it's really not worth chronic damage to your body or your soul.",

So basically they perform techniques that research can\u2019t back. \n\nThink of a car with a misaligned chassis that\u2019s causing faster wear on two tires compared to the other two. Would you rather replace the tires every few thousand miles, or would you rather fix the cars alignment and treat the source of the problem? \n\nTo me that\u2019s the difference between chiropractors and physical therapy. A good physical therapist will treat the source rather than just realigning as chiropractors do.",
