  "text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m half way through my masters program and have been working as a graduate assistant at my campuses library for about six months. And it\u2019s terrible. I honestly just want to make sure it\u2019s just not me who feels like full time staff treat GA\u2019s terribly. My job is mostly managing the student workers that work the front desk at the library (check out books, study rooms etc). I just feel like I get more job duties everyday and less and less instruction. Zero communication and then my supervisors are super passive aggressive when I ask questions. I would have quit awhile ago if it wasn\u2019t for the great health insurance. I guess I\u2019m mostly just venting but my job is really terrible for honestly no reason. I haven\u2019t done anything for my supervisors to treat me with such little respect. It could be a really chill job. I have been applying to full time positions. Fingers crossed",
