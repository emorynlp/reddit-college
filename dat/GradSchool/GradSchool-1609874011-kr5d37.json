I'm sorry so many people have had or are having similar experiences of burnout, but I appreciate the chance to commiserate. You've helped me realize I shouldn't be so hard on myself about all of this. Its a tough road. Take care of yourselves out there!",

This year especially has been rough (first year of a PhD, got bad health news with plans for an upcoming surgery, and ~2-3 years of prior burnout) and I\u2019ve been considering taking a break from the program until the summer. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to explain to my family that I DO love what I do, I just feel so tired most days and dread doing the work (love talking about it with peers and reading, but writing has become nearly impossible some days). This post gave me something to consider, and will probably send out a couple of emails today to see what I can do. Thank you, OP and everyone else sharing their experiences :)",

      "text": "So there is exhaustion and getting sick of doing something that you could call burnout in my book and then there is the feeling of burnout that you might get based on evaluating how much progress you've made versus how much progress you think you ought to have made.\n\nScrolling non-extensively, I guess people have talked about the former in detail. For the second case my (not so comprehensive) advice would be:\n\nDon't put all your proverbial eggs in one basket is what I think did the trick for me. It's easy to get lost in the detail when it comes to open-ended research. It should be natural to feel awful and feel like you're not being productive enough when this is the case. But then getting stuck in a downward spiral of more \"pointless\" work and consequently feeling more awful should, ideally to a large extent,  be avoidable misery. But you might just never know it was kinda \"pointless\" to keep pushing a dead end if you don't step back, zoom out, do something else and then come back afresh. Keeping perspective is key. Burning out might not really be burning out and might just be someone genuinely hitting a dead end yet not realizing they have.\n\nAlso, take care about your biology. You are not a machine and even machines can't keep running forever without maintenance. Exercise, get sleep, take breaks regularly when things feel like they're not going anywhere and you are actually feeling exhausted. Grad school is tough. I don't think intellectual burnout is the same as other burnouts people talk about in industry. But unsustainability is probably a fundamental cause underlying both.",

I think so many people tie their entire life into grad school because they have nothing else to tie their life to. \n\nWere you like this in undergrad? If you look at grad school like your life, you make it your life, and it's a shitty life. \n\nYou need to make your own life and have grad school be a part of that. Work 9-5, then go *do your own life.* Find love, do a hobby, work out. \n\nThere's always a reason why you can't do 9-5, but the reality is you can probably do 9-5 and graduate on time. It's about prioritizing yourself and your work, not fucking around, and then enjoying life so you can come back strong. \n\nThis is really hard to do, but I think the first step is realizing and working towards having YOUR OWN LIFE outside of school. Because honestly, these same actions are what cause adults to be workaholics and just work long hours for money or whatever it is. \n\nThose people don't just pop up, they're doing *this* in school and never developed their own life.",

So it's like I really never actually have that time off. I don't know that I'm necessarily a work-a-holic, but I'm a people-pleaser and a perfectionist. I'm trying to be more self compassionate and learn that I can say no to people, and that I don't have to make everyone happy, I just have to graduate! I'm not the kind of person who wants to spend 24/7 in the lab or doing research. It is important to me to pursue my other hobbies and spend time with the people I love.

              "text": "Oh I used to be a peaple-pleaser and perfectionist too, and I still have problems with too much detail when writing. However, I learned that,\n\na) Nobody cares about my stuff, and b) I'm not actually happy when I'm left to my own devices. \n\nSo in realizing that, I learned to step back a bit, work on my own stuff to my standards, but also, remember that nobody is going to understand/appreciate it as much as I do, so put that same energy into something that makes me happy. \n\nAlso, if you've ever seen a graduate student leave, it'll be surprising to see how quickly your PI replaces that position with someone else and gives them the same topic. \n\nYou think if you just leave, the topic will die and they'll be sad? No, the PI will probably work on it themselves and pull in grad students if they can't find a new student within a semester. \n\nIt's just like a job. Treat it like a job and it'll make you happier. Also, stepping away from it will let you relax and you'll be better at solving it because you're not so emotionally invested in a bad way. \n\n---\n\nI get it though. I have a colleague who breathes his work and is definitely better at most things research-related than I am. But that's ok, cause I'm just doing my own thing. He often frets/complains about work, and I never really have those worries/issues. \n\nIt's not a race either, so if we both graduate and he's making 2x what I do, who cares? I'm just doing my own thing. It's not like when you get a job, you'll suddenly be a different person who wants to be ambitious or try new shit. Maybe, if you have money, but most people just stay the same person, just with money, and spend it the same way they spent their other money before. I could honestly quit, be a teacher, make 40k, and be fine, cause my hobbies would let me do that on that budget, and I'd just not spend money on other shit to make it happen. \n\nThat mentality doesn't change if I make 40 or 80k",

At one point I had several very serious convos with faculty about a leave of absence. I didn't do it, but the conversations helped validate how I felt was legitimate. And if possible, try to ignore the feeling that your success / failure is on the line... that is NOT decided in grad school. Good luck :).",

The professional academics I know still love their field, but it definitely morphs into a job and they do put boundaries between their work and the rest of their life. They don't want to do anything else, but it's not their reason for living anymore either. The 18 hour days might get you that prestigious position, but it won't stop you from losing it because you can't keep going at that pace. FWIW, I still think my field is really cool and I love talking about it - but the daily grind of academia, the bullshit, the politics? No. Thanks. Never again. Sometimes I do guest teaching in public school classrooms and I LOVE that.\n\n>For the non-academic burnout, what happened physically and how did you recover? What's still weird mentally?\n\ntl;dr I got very sick and had a bunch of tests done. I thought I probably had something like MS or CFS, but in the end it was only gallbladder disease and severe anemia. I got lucky. That was a couple of years ago now. Mentally, I still can't face the idea of an office 8-5, because it went to hell at the end in a pretty traumatizing way. For years though, it was pretty great. But I just don't think I can do that life again. I want to make my own career, and I'm just getting started with that. It's going to be much riskier and less consistent, but it's what I want to do.

      "text": "I reached a pretty much continuous state of burn out for several years and just finished my PhD in Nov. I used the exact same term often, I was just trying to drag myself through the mud to the finish line.\n\nThe good news: It is definitely possible to recover from even long-term burn out. \n\nThe bad news: It is very difficult to recover from burn out while still doing the thing that led to it in the first place. \n\nTaking a break from the work is really the only way to really recover, but that is way easier said than done, especially since taking just a full weekend or even week to recharge may not cut it for years worth of burn out. So if you want to work on full recovery before finishing you may need to consider taking an actual leave of absence or long break, or at the very least adopt a really strict schedule so that you consistently have time evenings/weekends with no work. \n\nThat all is further complicated by the nature of burn out- if you're like me, the burn out initially was part of overworking but has turned into an inability to do any work over time. It feels like you can't take any sort of break because you aren't actually getting work done, so there isn't anything take a break from. This is not true though, constantly trying to work and stressing/thinking about work is incredibly taxing, and just because it may feel like you already aren't doing anything does not mean you are getting a break. \n\nYou know yourself better than anyone, so only you can decide if you are at a breaking point or if you can try to push through. It is 100% okay and good to leave a program, take a leave, etc. for your health and well-being if needed; I know many people who did so and they were far happier for it and have found good jobs. \n\nIf you feel that you want to try to push through, you still need to address the burn out as much as possible since it will not go away on its own and burn out makes even simple tasks much much harder to do. Therapy, medication, social support all help. The most important thing still is establishing time where you are not working at all, meaning you are not allowed to do work and have to do something else. This is really hard because if productivity is low it feels like you should be trying to work all the time to make up for it, but this will only make the burn out worse and you will not be more productive. So even if you don't get anything done during \"work time\", \"no work time\" still means you step away from the work for the day. I lost weeks/months of time to burn out and health issues and I graduated in 5.5 years (avg for program is 6) with a very happy advisor/committee- beating yourself up over not getting stuff done won't help and in the long run those low productivity days mean nothing, and I would have been better served using that time to rest and recover.\n\nTalk with your advisor and committee. Determine what you still need to do to finish. You don't have to commit to a specific timeline necessarily, it's more important to know what's left. Then you can implement strategies to work towards those tasks.",

The only thing I'd say is if you do take a leave, be very proactive in your healing and recharging - I don't think I would have gotten over my burnout without therapy and healing my body, as tempting as it would have been to get drunk every night and watch endless Netflix.",

Basically your body has been in fight or flight mode for months or years and at least in my case, it felt like I couldn\u2019t get out of that feeling of simultaneous panic and exhaustion. I also had poor eating and sleeping habits because my job was so demanding, and then was drinking too much in the evening to cope because I was just so tense and stressed.\n\nHere's more from the APA if you want to read about the physical consequences of stress: [https://www.apa.org/topics/stress-body](https://www.apa.org/topics/stress-body)\n\nSo to heal the damage of all of those things I tried to focus on 1) my physical health and 2) working with a therapist on tools to manage stress in the future.\n\nFor the physical stuff I just stuck to the things any GP would tell you for general health, like get enough sleep, drink lots of water, eat more vegetables and less sugar and processed foods, get enough exercise. It's honestly very worth talking to your own doctor about these things and specifics, or someone at campus health.\n\nFor the mental side, therapy was important but so was yoga, because going regularly helped me learn how to focus on my breathing and centre/ground myself, which I use a lot now when I feel \u2018panicky\u2019. Deep breathing (specifically the exhale) is supposed to be really good for prompting your parasympathetic nervous system and telling your body to calm down.\n\nI also noticed for myself that while I felt great when I had a glass of wine or two, that I had much worse anxiety the next day. So now I try to drink less often, and if I am in a bad headspace I don\u2019t drink at all. \n\nSorry this was so long-winded, but I hope it was helpful!",

          "text": ">That all is further complicated by the nature of burn out- if you're like me, the burn out initially was part of overworking but has turned into an inability to do any work over time. It feels like you can't take any sort of break because you aren't actually getting work done, so there isn't anything take a break from. This is not true though, constantly trying to work and stressing/thinking about work is incredibly taxing, and just because it may feel like you already aren't doing anything does not mean you are getting a break. \n\nThis is 10000% me, thank you for commenting about this",

I burned out at work (not grad school, so different but still), and taking 10 weeks off made a huge difference. \n\nAs an added bonus, my manager revised our team goals to lighten our loads. Turns out, losing 1 of a 4 person team is worth planning to prevent.\n\nAnyway, if you can take some time off for hobbies, rest, and self reflection, you should! I hope you recover well. Burnout is a horrible feeling.",
