If you find schools that accept lower than 3, then you\u2019re in good shape. Maybe some schools would make exceptions too, it could be worth asking. Just don\u2019t expect to get into higher-ranked schools (I didn\u2019t bother with McGill and UBC myself).",

      "text": "Short answer is yes. The longer answer is that it depends on the competitive standards both of the school you are applying to and the field at large. For example: a school might state that they won\u2019t consider anyone with a sub-3.0 gpa, but in reality due to the competition they won\u2019t admit anyone below a 3.6. Unfortunately, this information is never made public and there is a huge lack of transparency regarding the inner workings of these processes. The reality of the matter is that (at least for my field) schools get anywhere from 300-700 applications for 12 spots. They\u2019re not going to read all of those. They\u2019re going to use some sort of filter to get that number down to a manageable size. In many cases the easiest thing to use is gpa. But again, that\u2019s just my field and how competitive it is, I can\u2019t speak to yours.\n\nWork experience helps, but in order to overcome a sub-3.0 you\u2019re going to have to work for a very long time. Please consider the financial trade offs both of working and of doing a PhD (including whether a postdoc will be necessary afterward). I\u2019m not advising you on what to do, but I personally know a number of people that figured a PhD wouldn\u2019t be worth all of that time, effort, and opportunity cost and just went and made a career in industry. A PhD isn\u2019t to be undertaken lightly. Consider the route carefully and make sure it actually is what you want and -perhaps more importantly- will help you get to where you want to be as a career.\n\nJust my two cents. Best of luck!",

Also, how hard should we lean in to that experience in the essays?\n\nI'm honestly tempted to say: \n\nLook, I'm in my 30s with 13 years of lab experience and I'm willing to take a pay cut to do research in synthetic biology.  I'm not just familiar with techniques and instruments, I teach them to students.  When we get a new instrument, I'm the first to learn it so I can teach it to the rest of the department. You'd basically be getting a post-doc.  Plus, I'm not 23 so I can feed myself and won't bring drama to the lab.",
