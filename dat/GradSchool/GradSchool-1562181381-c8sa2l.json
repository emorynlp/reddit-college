  "text": "Of philosophy, of course. It's so unreal. I was so nervous before the defense that I couldn't eat or sleep properly for days. I couldn't even bring myself to practice the talk but when I got up there it just flew by and the audience enjoyed it and gave me a long applause.\n\nI was feeling pretty good, but then the closed door was brutal. Effectively, the thesis needs some work, where is the spectra, etc. I felt kinda defeated when they sent me out. Then they came out laughing and each congratulated me. I still can't believe I did it!",
