  "text": "I started my PhD this semester and I feel constantly stressed and anxious. I feel dumb and unfit for the lab even though I love the research. Does it get better with time? Or some of you felt this way during the whole time of a PhD? I cannot imagine living like this for many years.",

      "text": "Usually it does. If imposter syndrome is your major problem, it usually gets better. If there are issues with the lab management, your PI's attitude, etc. then it might not  but you might gain understanding over time.\n\nIn my experience, often what happens is after you're done with your first year, there will be some excitement for new students. You end up showing them the ropes and that is the moment where you feel like you are starting to know the ropes...and then it really improves. It can come in waves, as each new hurdle feels harder and you might feel stupid again, but then a little less stupid, and then smart, and then you find a new hurdle, but over all it gets easier.",

      "text": "I think the fact that you love the research is a good sign. For me, things haven't gotten better, but I also lost all interest in my research and academia in general so I didn't have that to keep me going. \n\nI do feel like my imposter syndrome went away, though. Something to keep in mind is that being \"smart\" isn't what leads to success in grad school--being driven, working hard, and staying organized are arguably the most important factors. \n\nAlso, when it comes to imposter syndrome, think of it this way: either you deserve to be where you're at (most likely), or you managed to con an entire department of intelligent and accomplished professors into granting you admission. Either way you're talented and going far ;). That rationalization helped me in my first year, and I haven't really experienced imposter syndrome specifically since then. For me, it is mostly just burn out and stress stemming from the fact that i don't feel like my research has any real world value. Since you note that you're still enjoying your research, I think there's definitely hope that things will get better for you. Good luck!",

I often feel like I somehow made a whole department see something in me that I don't have, but even if it were the case I should actually be proud haha but for real, thanks for your words, honestly what helped me go through undergrad and a master and now my PhD was solely that I like my research, which has been in the same line since I started studying. I hope you get better soon!  Finding no purpose for your work must be really tough but you're certainly strong for keep doing it.",
