Is the guarantor needed incase the student who is an adult has possibility to die? What's the collateral? Or do they give loans attached your SSN without collateral?",

      "text": "Forget immigrant, I don't know how *anyone* can afford over $70,000 a year in tuition. The median annual income in the United States is like $50,000, so the tuition here is more than most families make in a year. I would be extremely skeptical of paying that much money for a Master's level degree unless they have scholarships/grants you can apply to that dramatically reduce the cost of attendance. \n\nFor a program like that, I would assume people would take out loans and then pray that their post-graduation career will command them a salary high enough to pay off all that debt. From my perspective, that does not sound like a worthwhile investment.",

          "text": "You aren't supposed to pay for your own MBA\n\nIf you do, though, you just take out loans. If you're working like an established career (ie near 100k a year or more) paying off 50k in loans over a decade isn't the hardest thing ever. In a lot of major cities in the US, median income is closer to 80k so it's a lot less of an imposition",
