  "title:": "Completing a PhD at the same place I got my BS",
  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI\u2019m in a masters program at the same university where I completed undergrad. It made sense to go into the grad program here because my advisor has the exact same interests as I do, but other professors warned me that going to the same school for my graduate degree would make me less desirable as a researcher in the future. My plan was to maybe get a PhD somewhere else, but my project has turned into what is, essentially, a dissertation. If I spend another year here, I would be walking away with a PhD.\n\nIf I don\u2019t get a PhD here, I don\u2019t think that I will go on to get one anytime soon. I\u2019m 30 and the other person who is prevalent in my field will not be accepting any new grad students this year or the next. \n\nHas anyone stayed at the same university for a PhD? If so, did you have difficulty selling yourself in the future as a result? \n\nI\u2019d be interested to hear anyone\u2019s opinion, regardless of whether you had this experience or went to different universities.",

      "text": "Yes, in an ideal scenario doing a Bachelor/Master/PhD all at other locations is an advantage. In practice, it is a minor advantage. One of those if-all-other-things-are-equal advantages. In reality there are plenty of other important factors. For your scenario, where you can walk away with a PhD in essentially a year (because nobody cares about your (lack of) Master's degree after a PhD) I would definitely do that. No hesitation.",

      "text": "I did my Phd and Bachelors at different universities (but the same city) so I feel like I got the best of both worlds.  I was talking to some friends a few years ago about this. We came to the conclusion that if you want a shot at becoming an academic/professor -- a different school will put you at an advantage. If you need the advanced degree for private/public sector job (not academia), it doesn't matter and you might be put at a slight advantage staying because you (may) be able to finish faster.\n\n\nPros:\n\n* Keep your favorite pizza place\n* No learning curve for the culture and policies of the undergrad school\n* (Probably) have a relationship with your advisors before you begin\n* Can hit the ground running, so to speak. No adjustment time\n\nCons:\n\n* I see this with my friends/colleagues who do undergrad and grad at the same university - you begin to think that the way at your school is the **only** way to do things and the way that others do things is wrong/less effective/etc.\n* (unless you're already at a desirable university for your field) your opportunities to network (both academic and professional) may become more limited because you see the same people.\n* People have different research skills, interests, and capabilities - going to a different university can expose you to these new ideas and make you a more creative academic.",

Every university has a unique culture. Even separate colleges and departments within a university have different ways of doing things. It's similar to the \"hidden curriculum\" that first generation students have so much trouble learning. Getting exposed to those small \"unwritten rules\" will give you insight/perspective/experience that will help during interviews.",

      "text": "I did both BS and PhD at the same place. I worked on a project as an undergrad that I wanted to continue - so I even stayed with the same advisor! As far as I can tell it has not negatively impacted my career. I went into industry, and here the focus initially (right out of PhD) is on what skills you bring. Once you\u2019re in, it\u2019s all about industry experience in future job searches. Being on the hiring side from time to time, I haven\u2019t weighed whether people stayed at the same university for multiple degrees.\n\nSelling yourself is about how you discuss your work. Can you engage in a back and forth, think on your feet. Do you understand experimental design etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re trying to stay in academics, the old rules may still apply. But we don\u2019t have the same limitations on gaining new experiences and skills today. \n\nFor context I received PhD in 2015 and am now a principal scientist at a biotech in Boston (3rd position post-grad).",

      "text": "I did BS/MS/PhD all at different institutions. I was told by many profs, it was better professionally because you learn different styles of research and group dynamics, variety of skills, and you significantly broaden your network of collaborators, which is huge in getting a job.\n\nAt least in my field knowing someone, or knowing someone who knows someone can get you a high level job you otherwise would not even be considered for. E.g.: I did an undergrad internship with an alumni during my BS, and every year we had a 'career day' with other alumni coming back to give advice, offer internships/job openings, etc. There was one from a major govt research lab that I wanted to intern at (was told not to even apply the year before) so I tried to get in again, but this year he was more blunt and said sorry but do not waste your time applying if your not in grad level, your resume wont even go through. Later at our annual after hours bar socializing, my old internship and the one I wanted to work with were catching up. I come up to the bar to grab a drink and they call me over, new one says just email me when you apply and and I'll make sure your resume gets through. That internship is what got me accepted to my MS program (asked my prof why I got in).\n\nMy MS prof was dead set on me doing a PhD, with or without her. But I was not, so she got me into the state level 'epa' to get an idea of MS level jobs, and ended up with a job offer to stay.\n\nPhD advisor (obviously I was converted to wanting to stay in research) got me into collaborations with NASA, which ended up netting me two 1st author papers, and a post doc offer.\n\nOnce or twice every year for 5 years the govt lab internship guy would email me saying 'hey you graduate yet?\". Ended up interviewing a week after defending. During which my now boss said 'we don't have funding, maybe in 3-4 months we can figure something out'. During my interview session with the folks I worked with interning, I told them that and that it meant I had to take another offer I had in hand. About an hour before leaving, they hunt me down and say 'pulled some strings, not 100% where the money will come from, but we'll figure that out', and I got the job, largely because that internship that came out of two guys chatting over beers.\n\nThat said, it was just my personal experience and networking is a huge part of being successful in my field. I would not disqualify a candidate for staying at the same school, but there would certainly be a question about it. If the answer was good, that would be the end of it. Just need to show how you learned a breadth of skills, learned how to collaborate with a variety of research/personality style, and how you can have variety and adapt your research to the ever changing funding climate/directions.\n\nPersonally, if I could get a PhD staying one year v maybe 3-5 more years at another place, it would probably be a no-brainer. I got into my number 1 school for PhD (rejected for my MS), but ended up where I did partly bc it was only 3 yrs v 5 at my #1.",

Did I prepare for that question in advance? Yes. Just know your advisor is more important to getting the job after then the name of your school.
