Many professors are super busy with their own stuff, so to save them time, they'll have you write your own LoR and they'll look over it and if they see something that needs changing, they'll change it.\nOn mine, I just wrote two things that I excelled at and one thing that I needed improvement on. This helps with balance, and doesn't make it look like your bragging about yourself and you don't need improvement. Lol\n\nBut don't be turned off by writing your own letters. I was the same way at first too, but then I saw it as a way to truly evaluate myself!",

That said, I went to a small, teaching-focused undergrad where it was easier to get profs to write recs for you, which could also be considered a bit of an unfair advantage.

      "text": "One of the profs I worked for as an undergrad research assistant had me do this (two other profs wrote me letters themselves). I thought it was strange at first, too, but we had a good working relationship and I knew he thought highly of me. He told me to make the letter as over-the-top positive as I could, and then let him tone it down if need be. I never saw the final letter after he reviewed it, but ended up getting offers to a couple of very good PhD programs.\n\nI later learned that this practise is indeed fairly common. I think it depends a lot on the professor and how many other students they have asking for letters.\n\nThat being said, professors for whom you've worked or volunteered are more likely to be willing to refer you compared to a prof who only knows you as a student in their class.",

From my understanding, undergrad class sizes are far bigger than grad programs and some undergrad professors can be teaching near 200 students per term. Because of that, I think it makes total sense. If the application was a grad student applying for a PhD program, then I would think that having the professor have more of an influence in the LOR would be better.",

After you write the letter and send it to your prof, they will likely read it over to confirm that they\u2019re comfortable signing it from themselves, and then forward that to your grad programs\u2019 admissions. You would want to include anything about yourself that makes you a good fit for each program: what qualities would you bring, as a student, to the program. I would also probably include some descriptions of academic success that you\u2019ve had under the supervision or guidance of each prof that is signing your letter, this way the program gains an idea of what mentoring you would be like if you were accepted.
