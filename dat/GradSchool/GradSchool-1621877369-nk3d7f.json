I just wanted to show another perspective and ideally someone to validate I\u2019m not just lazy....\n\nI pretty much keep a 9-5 schedule except for when I have long in vivo experiments, a big presentation or the rare occasion I have motivation. Sometimes if I have no lab work I just take a day off if I\u2019m tired/bored or just don\u2019t want to work. \n\nMy advisor is happy with my progress and I should finish with 2 first author papers. I still die from imposter syndrome when I read about people doing 80 hour weeks though",

You are doing amazing. You manage to hold your position, get satisfactory results while keeping a healthy and sane head on your shoulders. This is something I want to get to right now. So be proud. Also Imposter Syndrome affect everybody at some point, some people for longer. Hustle culture is being paraded everywhere. It's shit. That is really making people sick. So don't worry, you are healthy. It's them who need to worry about.",

They read 1 sentence every 30min and only feel safe because \"they spent the day at the library\".\n\nImo, it is the same thing in the lab.

I might skim a paper before bed, but I tried to only do that if it was a paper that I really wanted to read and would get me excited to write more the next day. \n\nI did my writing early in the morning, like starting at 7 am. So I always had time in the evenings to have hobbies and a life. I usually tucked myself into bed by 10:30-11. \n\nEveryone works differently, but I think coming up with a system for how you work is critical to your success as grad student and beyond. \n\nEven today, I have set hours where I open my emails because I hate how email fragments the day and distracts from major tasks.

I realized that I actively wean myself out of the \"workaholic researcher\" state of mind during the last months of my RA days in preparation for the start of my PhD. I actually was successful during the first year of my PhD-- supervisors were happy with my progress  even though I don't spend 50+ hrs in the lab. I had time to join uni clubs & societies and attend most/some of their events as well as do some of my hobbies.\n\nI started to feel pressure to overwork again during the lockdown when I would see one of my labmates still going to the lab almost everyday even though our supervisor didn't really require us to (we were both considered essential workers for our institute since we were in charge of refilling N2  for one of the NMRs in our bldg). Soon, other labmates were also coming to the lab even during lockdown since they also feel pressured to come (including me), seeing that my supervisor was pleased that this one student that was still generating results/data. I relapsed to my workaholic researcher days shortly after this, to the point that I felt guilty not working during the Christmas break because I knew that my labmates were still working in the lab (granted most of them did not celebrate Christmas). I burned out around that time and what's worse is it took like 2 months of barely scraping by (and a very disappointing progress report during our lab meeting) before I can regain interest with my research again. \n\nIt's just really hard to maintain a non-workaholic attitude when you see all the people in your lab being a workaholic. I just really want to go back to that time when I'm not affected by the overworking culture of my labmates because I know I was effective during that time. \ud83d\ude22",

My results came relatively easily, but I know people who had to slave away just to get one sample or set of data.

I think a lot of grad students don't understand that they have the power to say no (unless they have an abusive advisor). \n\nHow I see it, it is my responsibility to modulate the amount of work on my plate. I often push back on my advisor. He'll say \"I need you to do A, B, and C by next week\" and my response is \"Ok I can have two of those done, which two are most important?\". I understand it is not that simple for many people with their advisors, but it's an example of how I modulate my workload.\n\nIn order to get around the imposter syndrome, I did a lot of reading about how much work is feasible in a week. Turns out that we can only productively focus on \"deep work\" for \\~4-5 hours a day (measured by time spent completely tuned in and focused). Most Ph.D. work (learning, writing, coding, etc) is considered deep work. We also cap out at about 45-50 hours a week (at a desk, not necessarily 100% focused) before we hit diminishing returns. Anything above 55 hours, and you can actually start to have negative returns because you start to make mistakes. \n\nAlso, there are innumerable short- and long-term health impacts of overworking. The WHO just came out with a report that showed in drastically increases the risk of stroke down the line (10+ years after the overworking)\n\nMoral of the story, it's actually detrimental to work that many hours.",

If you work shorter hours, but get plenty done, then that's the only metric you need to care about. \n\n\"Comparison is the thief of joy.\" Find your joy, your balance, and stick to it.

So I frequently work evenings or weekends, but I also frequently don't even log on until noon or lose motivation midday and go run errands instead. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a post-doc now and still coasting on this work life balance despite what people say academia should be like.",

In Germany you get 30 days of vacation, I have a lot of letters that I still have 20+ vacation days left and loose them off not taken by a deadline. I basically hoped to be done sooner by taking less time of (not even Sundays for while). Looking back I'm not actually sure this is true.

I did everything with zero support from my department, PI or community. Burnout was not a surprise. also all my thesis work is hand on, lab work that I could not do from home.\n\nEdited to add more but I think you get my point!

The latter is all about hard work and the former is all about ingenuity and mental \"freshness\". \n\nThe hard part about the early phase of a PhD is that you probably don't have much menial work to do yet. You don't have data to analyse, you don't have papers to write, and all of your research is at a conceptual stage. You can read papers, sure, but that's tiring and deathly boring when it's the only thing on your calendar for 6 hours a day, for months on end. So it's very normal that you'd do maybe 4-5 hours of work and then have to call it quits. \n\nI don't work anywhere near 40 hours a week because I don't feel I need to. I get my work done in the time I do spend and I use my \"free\" time in work hours to ponder things, which is basically just normal work for a theorist. Sometimes our best ideas come during a nice stroll, or playing a video game! I don't feel any guilt for my work hours. I don't even track them. I'd recommend you stop tracking yours too.",

      "text": "I personally hate workaholic culture and tend to be pretty insistent on keeping my workload <=40 hours most weeks (since before big deadlines I sometimes wind up with up to 60 hour weeks). I'm very lucky to be in a department where TA duties are fairly relaxed and pay is acceptable (which I know contributes to many grads' need to work beyond otherwise reasonable bounds). But yeah you're not alone, it sometimes feels alienating to establish a firm work-life boundary because academic culture doesn't always support having one (and it certainly is a privilege to be able to do so).",

I know I am a workaholic but am trying desperately to reform. \n\nI am guessing it may be similar for others but there are a lot of factors that go into making me feel like I have to be constantly working. Years of being told that hard work is how to get ahead. Working at companies where everything was an emergency all the time, and overtime was expected because not delivering was not acceptable. I\u2019m a people-pleaser which makes it tough for me to push back. And yes, identity is probably part of it - I\u2019m proud of being good at what I do and if my data looks shitty then I want to fix that ASAP even if it\u2019s a dumb amount of work.\n\nHonestly after years of having my nose to the grindstone, trying to relax stresses me out because I feel guilty for not being productive. I get that it\u2019s not mentally healthy and I\u2019m working on that but it\u2019s definitely a factor.",

Those are demonstrably untrue. You can care very much about your work and be wholly dedicated to doing a good job and still not be a workaholic, so I wouldn\u2019t say those are causes at all. They may not even be necessary conditions.\n\nIf you see workaholism as arising from good qualities like that then you\u2019ll easily class workaholism as a good thing, and find it a lot harder to let go of.",

I certainly do not think people who are better at maintaining work-life balance don\u2019t care about their jobs. \n\nI have coworkers who are excellent at their jobs but much better than I am at drawing and maintaining boundaries - and I admire them for that.

Seeing people work all day drains me but I can also see why someone might do it and obviously the more hours you put in the better you're at something but also the more at risk of burnout or letting other areas slide by. It's more of a cost benefit analysis and should be more of a personal choice when it comes to overtime.\n\nI'd say it's a choice unless you're making everyone else around you miserable.",
