  "text": "I'm a MS student who's preparing to graduate and also apply to PhD programs abroad (I'm from Asia) this year. I had a question regarding the relevance of my master's thesis to PhD applications.\n\nIn my school, a master's thesis is largely considered a formality. Students often participate in other research projects and publish in journals and conferences during their time. If they have first-authored publications before graduating, those are largely \"recycled\" and used as master's theses. If they don't, then they're often advised (as was I) to \"recycle\" papers that they participated in as coauthors but to add \"more story\" to it.\n\nI've been working on a research project for the past 7-8 months or so but the results are still not publishable and I'll probably continue to work on this until December. My thesis is due in November and my advisor's told me to just use another publication that I have. The problem is that this publication deals with a topic that's a bit unrelated to what I'm working on right now and what I want to work on during my PhD.\n\nMy question is, would this be considered a problem during PhD applications? I don't want faculty to see my thesis and think I'm an idiot but at the same time I can't really find the time to put into this. Any thoughts are appreciated.",
