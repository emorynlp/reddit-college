  "text": "  \n\n\nI haven\u2019t done shit. And I need advice. Sorry for the ramble, but here is my series of events that have led me to this point. \n\nI enrolled in Fall 2019, had a tough first semester, but loved taking classes and met once a week with my PI, Sara. My situation is a little different as I had funding from an outside source that didn\u2019t involve any of her data, research, etc. But I am effectively her student, though I feel extremely disconnected from other students in the lab.\n\nSpring 2020- Sara went on sabbatical, and then fucking COVID happened. I HATED online learning and most of my classes got super abbreviated and I can\u2019t say I got much out of them. (Stats, writing courses, coding courses, etc) \n\nFall 2020- Finished my proposal for research, hit some milestones, still hated (absolutely hated), and didn\u2019t thrive at all in my online classes at all (my fault tbh). My PI came back from sabbatical, had some time for online meeting times-but I was so embarrassed by how little progress I had made that I rarely contacted her, and she rarely (if ever)  contacted me. \n\nSpring 2021- Found out Sara was going through a divorce, all while managing 20 something students, and directing an LTER. I finished all my coursework but completed nothing regarding my thesis, literally nothing. I had weekly meetings with another person I work with more closely on my committee, and that seemed to help, a little. Finally got some help with coding in person. But then I ran out of funding and this was supposed to be the semester I graduated/defended my master's thesis. She told me that I was about 5 months behind. \n\nFall 2021-  Now the semester is almost over, and I still have nothing done. I have a TA-ship and that was a HUGE learning curve for me, but I still never heard a word from Sara. \n\nThat is until yesterday, she sent an email that basically said: \u201csend me what you have, you need a full draft done by 12/6, or I won\u2019t put in a request for you to be funded, bye.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m FREAKING out. I have no idea how to respond to her. She scares me, I feel really dumb, and I know I have nothing to show. It would be absolutely impossible for me to have a full draft by then. Currently, I have a timeline that I\u2019m working with that sets me up to have a full draft (a manuscript) by 2/11/2022.\n\nI just don\u2019t know how to tell her \u201cI felt hyper unsupported, struggled through mental health and a break-up, not to mention a global pandemic\u201d. I\u2019m just so scared and overwhelmed I literally don\u2019t know what to do.",

Be honest, but do your homework and present something reasonable. Take ownership, at the of the day it\u2019s your work, and she may just be trying to scare you. I doubt they\u2019ll just kick you out but you need to present some work on how you will get all of it done in the next few months",

      "text": "I guess my advice is just to be honest with her as soon as you can. I\u2019ve been in situations where I\u2019ve felt awful about lack of progress,but just meeting with my advisor and coming up with a path forward together has always made me feel better about it in the end. Also try not to be too hard on yourself? You seem to be blaming yourself for a lot of things that are outside your control (ie struggling with online classes). I personally found this experience to be incredibly isolating and in that environment sometimes I just CANNOT find the motivation to do literally anything even though I\u2019m super stressed about lack of progress. This shit is HARD!",
