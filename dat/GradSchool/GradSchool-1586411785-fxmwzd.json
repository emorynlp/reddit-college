  "text": "I passed my dissertation defense today with a few revisions! It seemed really anticlimactic with all the work that I put in the past 5 years. But as soon as my advisor called me Dr. kat_scratch_fever, my heart just soared! That was until a few hours later when I was coming down from the adrenaline high. I feel like I ran a mental marathon. Here I thought I'd celebrate all night but I crashed. Hard. It was worth it though.",
