  "text": "It's been almost 10 years since I graduated college, which was the last time I was in any type of school, and I've worked in corporate positions ever since. Now I am looking to apply to grad school for a Masters in Counseling which requires an academic reference. When I reached out to admissions about a possible alternative, they said I could submit a professional one but it would have to be a very strong one as it's not deal to be missing an academic reference. I've seen similar posts asking about this in this sub that had some good suggestions, but I wanted to pick your brains about my thought process:\n\nI *could* reach out to my college professors, catch them up on what I've been up to, and see if they would be willing to write me one. I could also look into taking a class on my own and try to get one from that professor (though this option might not work out due to timing). But in my view neither choice would be of great substance as it would merely check off the \"academic\" portion but would likely be pretty generic and less relevant compared to other references I could get from those who have known me for years. Would it not carry more weight to have two strong professional references from bosses/colleagues who have worked with me in different capacities in the most recent years? I have a solid GPA from undergrad so that demonstrates I am capable of succeeding in the classroom (my degree was in Communications and Psychology so a lot of the classes I took are relevant for the Masters program I'm pursuing), and in my professional life I've had to meet deadlines, take ownership of various projects, and collaborate with others, not unlike what happens in purely academic settings.\n\nOne program I am interested in does offer an alternative via an acquaintance that teaches at college-level or has a doctorate (but you don't have to have taken a class with them), which might suggest that they care about the person writing the reference being in higher education... which I guess might make a little more sense? Ultimately if it's safest to include an academic reference, I am willing to do what I can to include it. Just curious about people's thoughts on this!",

If so, your previous professor would be able to refresh their memory of your work by looking at those.",

      "text": "I took a Coursera class called \"Introduction to Micro- and Macroeconomics\" from a pluralist perspective because some of the masters programs I was applying to required that applicants know about it a little. I was able to track down the professor at her home university and got an okay LOR from her. That, plus two strong professional references and my SOI helped me get into a program in Canada. Otherwise, the rest of my qualifications are similar to yours in that I got my undergrad degree in 2000 and I'd been working in my field for about 10 years. It's worth a shot.",
