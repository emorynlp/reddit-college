  "text": "I am at a complete loss for words. I work in mathematics and have been working on a particular problem for almost a year. I was not expecting much in terms of competition given how specific and relatively inactive my field is (the line of research I am working in really has papers typically with \\~5 citations per year). Moreover, there is much breadth in terms of the types of problems people work on in this field. Now, lo and behold, not only is a paper published this month on the exact problem I am trying to solve, but they do it more or less THE SAME WAY I WAS DOING IT (i.e., I can't publish an \"alternative proof\" type paper or anything). I am picking up the pieces and looking towards finding another problem in this area which maybe I can apply my work to... but FUCK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust needed to vent.",

Then Hurricane Maria hit and we were out of the lab for a month and without power for a few more. This result in a significant delay in his project. Just when he was in the middle of writing his dissertation, he received a newsletter from a journal with a paper recomendation. This paper was almost exactly like his project. After a few weeks of crying and been angry he decided to pivot to something similar and even was able to use some of his old results. \n\nI know this can be heartbreaking, at least you know you can make quality research. Hope you find something new and exciting to work on. Best of luck!",

It had had only emerged right before I submitted and I had to rush to put the chapter together. We didn't realise we were working on the same thing but there were a *few* differences in the approach and I had an angle she hadn't thought of. We've agreed to coauthor the follow-up to her paper, assuming it gets published soon, so it might be worth reaching out! My situation doesn't isn't nearly as bad as yours but it happens a lot and people understand. And, on the bright side, you're clearly doing something right if an idea you were working on and its solution got published. Hope it works out for you :)",

Look for cases where it fails and use your thesis to highlight them.  \n\nNot an expert on various areas of math but let's say you developed a new way of predictive modeling and a paper showing how the modeling method worked was published while I was research it.  The next step here I would do is to torture that damn method to find it's weakness.  Does it work with sparse datasets?  Does it work with data with a great deal of heteroskedasticity.   Does it work with near zero variance data?  Does it work with high multicollinearity?   See where it fails, demonstrate why it fails and you have a new thesis that still uses most of your work.",
