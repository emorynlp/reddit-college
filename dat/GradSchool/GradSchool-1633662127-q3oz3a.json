  "title:": "Advice needed: Thesis advisor damaged my laptop",
  "text": "I'm in a bit of a precarious situation.\n\nToday I was in the computer lab on campus working on my research. I had my laptop inside my backpack on a chair next to me. My thesis advisor came in to speak with me and dropped my backpack from about two feet onto the ground so he could sit in the chair.\n\nI checked my laptop immediately and thought it was fine. I got home and discovered the USB antenna for my wireless mouse had been jammed into the USB port. I had to break the antenna to remove it so the mouse is now useless. Part of the antenna remained jammed inside the port so I had to go over to the local PC repair shop to have it removed. It took less than a minute so the guy didn't bill me for that, thankfully. Unfortunately, I got home and discovered the USB port does not work any more, either. I tried multiple USB drives and none connected, so I'm certain that something is not working with it.\n\nI know my advisor didn't do it on purpose but at the same time, he handled my possessions extremely carelessly. I wouldn't handle a bag of rocks the way he did (that might be because I'm a geologist, though...).\n\nI'm okay with eating the cost of a new mouse but I'm a more upset about the USB port. The local PC repair shop has free diagnostics on factory built laptops (which mine is) but I'm sure even the cheapest of repairs is going to run $50.00 at the least assuming its something simple.\n\nThe school cut my TA position due to budget woes so I'm trying to be as frugal as possible right now given I have minimal income. I don't want to rock the boat with my thesis advisor by telling him he damaged my PC but I also don't really want to eat the entire cost of repairing my PC assuming it can be repaired for a reasonable amount.\n\nAny advice would be welcome.",

I think it's fine to get an estimate from the repair shop and tell your adviser that you know he did not intentionally damage your computer, but when he dropped your backpack on the floor he damaged your laptop and it needs to be repaired, said in a tone that implies he is going to pay for it. \n\nIt doesn't matter whether he intended to damage your property or not, your computer was damaged because he was negligent so he should pay for the damages. However, unfortunately, given that he has less than common sense already, you may end up having to pay the cost yourself. If you explain your tight financial situation with the repair shop, they might offer you a payment plan depending on the cost. \n\nAlternatively, if your student union has some kind of mutual support fund (if you even have a union) you could also look into that. My student union was giving folks money for unexpected expenses because of pandemic-related budget cuts, so others might have done similarly.",

I opened up the screen to make sure it wasn't spiderwebbed and when it turned on immediately, I assumed it was fine, put it back in my pack and went about my day. It was only when I got home and my mouse wasn't working that I realized the receiver was wedged into the USB port.\n\nI went to the local PC shop today and the guy told me the USB ports on most laptops are soldered onto the motherboard.

Luckily the damage seems to be isolated to the USB port with no further damage that I've detected. The USB splitter for $15 I bought has given me the same functionality as I had previously. \n\n>In the long run, maintaining a positive relationship with your advisor is way more important than $50.\n\nSometimes you have to ignore what is \u201cfair\u201d and do what is pragmatic.\n\nThat's pretty much what I'm gonna do.

Say that you are trying to save some money because your position was cut and if there is an insurance for this you would be glad if you could use that. \nThere are two options now: he realizes it was his fault entirely and he just pays you. No harm done. \nOr he says there is no such insurance. (Which in my opinion he would only say if he doesn't care). In this case for relationship reasons I would not pursue it any further. You would be in the right but it might not be worth it if it means your supervisor hates you now. \n\nI assume there is no insurance for this case",
