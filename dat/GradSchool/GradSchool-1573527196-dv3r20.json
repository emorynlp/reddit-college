  "text": "I want someone to understand what I\u2019ve been through these past few year. I\u2019m currently a PhD student, about a month away from my defense. By many measures, I\u2019ve been successful in grad school. I have six manuscripts, and I\u2019ve sequenced quite literally tens of thousands of DNA samples. But today, my advisor told me that I\u2019ve disappointed her so much that she\u2019s stepping down as my advisor. My last experiment (for manuscript #7) failed for reasons outside my control (imo, it failed because of decisions she made, but regardless, it\u2019s science. Projects fail all the time). But in her eyes, it was a personal failure of mine. I already have a post-doc lined up for January. I feel so betrayed and let down. I\u2019ll have to find a new advisor and committee and hopefully they will approve my work and let me defend. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019ll still be ok and I won\u2019t lose the post-doc, but it hurts the most that my advisor thinks I\u2019m a failure. I\u2019ve dedicated almost every waking hour of the past 5 years to her and the lab. I\u2019ve worked so hard. \n\nI know exactly when and where and why my relationship with my advisor started to break down. A little over a year ago, I was a victim of a home invasion and physical and sexual assault. The person then stalked and harassed me for months. Long story short, the police and court system were no help at all. When I told my advisor, she gave me an awkward pat on the back and said \u201cYou\u2019re strong, I know you\u2019ll be ok\u201d. I was most definitely not ok. I had daily panic attacks and I never felt safe in my own home, much less going out into the world. I especially did not feel safe on campus where my assailant walked around freely. I moved twice to try to regain some semblance of safety and sanity. I definitely experienced PTSD symptoms, flashbacks, nightmares, and so many hours lost to disassociative episodes. I never really felt like I could open up to my advisor again and we frequently clashed. Since my lab work was done, I mostly stayed home to write. However, she constantly requested that I come to campus for seminars and (imo dumb things like) doing the lab\u2019s dishes. Coming to campus was really, really  hard for me. But I still managed to write 6 papers. But because this last experiment failed, she\u2019s so disappointed in me that she won\u2019t even be my advisor for hopefully my last few weeks of grad school. It also feels like sabotage because I already have my next job lined up. I feel so heartbroken.",

      "text": "Oh my God. For the last month I've been preaching so hard about the importance of mental health and how graduate college could not give a fuck less about it. They treat us like slaves and they don't give a shit about anything but getting themselves published. About a month ago my advisor started send me really aggressive and threatening emails, told me that he doesn't have a research project for me and that everything I've done so far is irrelevant, and won't take out the abusive PhD student in our lab. \n\nI am so incredibly sorry that this has happened to you. You are clearly extremely dedicated and successful and there is nothing that that person could do to rectify what they have done to you. I feel so strongly for you and I'm so sorry that you are going through this and I really hope that you have contacted the dean of your college, the graduate college, the president of the university, the ethics department, everybody you can think of. Talk to your committee members. Talk to faculty mentors. Talk to your other grad students. Talk to anyone you can because this is complete fucking bullshit and I can't fathom standing for it.\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "text": "Wow I am so sorry first of all your experience sounds absolutely heart breaking. \n\nFirst, shame on your teacher. To me it is clear that they feel they are not equipped to handle your situation and cannot act confrontational or admit their short-comings (so common for PhD's, must be the ego or something) but the super important thing about that is that it has NOTHING to do with you. It is not your fault that you were attacked. It is not your fault that you were left to deal with the trauma. It is not your fault that the experiment failed (also like SO WHAT tis life). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, I personally don't think it's worth it to reconcile with your adviser so I would hope that you can find another and a committee and that it all works out for you. And honestly, if it doesn't, it will. Maybe not immediately but you will defend your thesis. You will get a job. Things in our lives are often out of our control, the best thing to do is to keep breathing and roll with the punches. I mean DAMN look at what you've overcome already! This is only a section of a chapter of your book. One good lesson I have taken from your situation, and maybe you can find some comfort from this as well, is that in academia - you come first, regardless of whether you're at the top or the bottom of the food chain, your work, your research, is incredibly more valuable to you than the kind words of your higher ups. Yes networking has a huge place in academia but the \"academic\" portion I would argue is more relevant.",

The wild part is, is it sounds like you were still incredibly productive during this time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely fucked up, and ironically I hope this doesn't echo too badly what your adviser said to you, but stay strong. Not because it's easy, or that you should just bury something as intense as PTSD, which is known to be particularly worse when the event happens in your own home (for the exact reasons you described). But stay strong because if you finish, pass your defense, and successfully move on to your post-doc, then you won. You beat this person who, in a time where awareness of the importance of mental health has significantly increased, is that insensitive as to hold that against you. There's not really much I, or other anonymous commentators on the internet can provide other than some words of support and encouragement. But that being said, prove this bitch wrong.",

      "text": "I've heard of situations like this before, just maybe not so close to the defense, and I think this is one major area that needs to change in academia. In these situations, I think it should be fine to just not have an adviser or the department steps in and assigns a new adviser rather than placing the burden on the student. Professors that just up and quit like that should have to face some consequences too if they do so without a good reason because some people may do it to sabotage their students and those people need to be fired. \n\nI think your adviser needs to be retrained by the department or placed on probation where her supervisory obligations would be up for review on a regular basis. The fact that you experienced such a traumatic event and that your adviser continued to harass you into coming to campus for trivial things given your mental health shows a profound lack of empathy and judgment that I'd consider it negligence. I'm sure there's some grounds for a complaint of some kind given that she knew about your trauma and still chose to victimize you afterwards. \n\nIf your department is worth a damn, your committee should come together and work with you to figure this out.",

Depending in the size of your department/uni, the process might be a bit different or you might have to jump through multiple hoops.\n\nFirst look up the grad student handbook of your department,  grad school and university to make sure you fulfill all requirements. \n\nTake all supporting documents of your work and meet with your program coordinator.  In most cases,  the program director will sort out a path for you.  If you don't get a satisfactory result from this meeting,  talk with your department chair and coordinator from grad school. The more people in administration know about this,  the more immune you'll be in case your advisor comes back at you.\n\nBest option will be to choose a person from your current comittee as your thesis chair and update the forms. Depending on the rules set by your dept, college or uni, In the worst case, your graduation date(graduation walk) may be pushed back by 6 months. You could defend and join your post doc after your phd defense is completed.\n\nIf you're an international student you might have to jump through more hoops. But don't give up.  You're at the finish line. I've been in a similar position as yours and had to switch advisors and groups 3 years into the program. My ex-advisor 'stole' a manuscript and published it 2 years later not including me as an author and also tried to spread false info about me so that other PIs do not take me in as their student. I finished my thesis and graduated this August and am currently at my first postdoc at a very good place.  In such situations,  it's easy to feel that everything is lost. But don't give up. Know that there will always be someone to help you when you need it. \n\nIt is sad to see the amount of academic bullying in Ph.D. programs across the globe. Sadly,  not many students are aware of this while getting into Ph.D. programs.",

Please take care of yourself and you deserve all the amazing things coming to you.\n\n\n 6 manuscripts??

There must be some other advisor willing to take you on for your defense, it's almost no work for them. Plus they can count you as another student whom they successfully mentored.  It seems like the chair of the department might be a good resource in this situation if you have  a good standing with them.\n\nIt's too bad that your former advisor was unwilling to allow you to defend with them. But the sooner you get them out of your life the better. It's almost comical the number of times that I've seen reported here and elsewhere, that an advisor will do something incredibly short sighted and destructive that negatively affects others' and sometimes their own careers.",

I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that some professors (including one at my school who didn\u2019t get tenure mostly due to not caring about students\u2019 academic welfare while they were in his course) are so self-important that when their students, especially grad students (who are especially vulnerable b/c they\u2019re essentially doing indentured academic servitude for 5+ years) reach out about something that poses a legitimate challenge to conducting their work as required, they don\u2019t give them the appropriate leeway or show a shred of sympathy. Obviously you want a professor who knows their field and isn\u2019t just talking out of their ass, but you need to consider both components when hiring someone. OP happened to choose an advisor who didn\u2019t support OP when OP needed it. That\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault. \n\n\n      I don\u2019t care how much grant money or star power you have as a professor in your department, if you can\u2019t also show that you\u2019re a decent human being in dealing with your students and other professors, then that casts serious doubt for me on whether you should be a tenured professor. Life is complex and messy. If you\u2019re a professor and don\u2019t understand that then that\u2019s not cool",
