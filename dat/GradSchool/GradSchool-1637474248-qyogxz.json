  "text": "I graduated with my bachelors in psychology with a 3.9 GPA. The issue is none of my letters of recommendation are from my bachelors professors, just my associate ones. I\u2019m hoping my personal statement can help me but should I mention I\u2019m legally blind and that\u2019s why I was online for my bachelors? I\u2019m aiming to get into the clinical psychology masters at UCF. *reposted due to major typo in title *",

      "text": ">The issue is none of my letters of recommendation are from my bachelors professors, just my associate ones.\n\nDid you have a senior psychology class where you wrote multiple papers, and you earned top marks with good feedback from the professor on the papers? \n\nIf so, you could ask that professor for a recommendation. People get confused and think it's all about knowing the professor personally. But the point of a recommendation letter is to talk about someone's strengths as a student. An online class, that often happens through your writing, and your teacher can attest to that.",
