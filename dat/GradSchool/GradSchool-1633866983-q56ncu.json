  "text": "Hello everyone. I\u2019m writing my personal statement(s) for PhD applications (History) and have a question whether something is worth talking about:\n\nI decided to go abroad for my masters and I\u2019m worried this might negatively affect me since the university is still good school, especially in my subfield, but it\u2019s not one of the \u201celite\u201d schools in the US (the school is accredited in the US)\u2026 Admissions committees and potential supervisors in my discipline should know that it\u2019s still a great school in my field.  \n\nI personally don\u2019t care and am very happy with my choice. But I\u2019m wondering how much time I should dedicate to explaining this because 1. The reasons I chose this school are relevant because I believe it could set me apart from other applicants 2. The school is in the region that I\u2019m studying 3. It\u2019s about me and my personal/academic transformation and experience\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to come across as if I\u2019m trying to explain why I chose this school as if I believe it hurts me and needs explaining. Like I said, I personally don\u2019t care (okay maybe a little since I\u2019m writing this) but I tend go over think and convince myself that this is what admissions will think. But I still want to include this a bit for the aforementioned reasons and it\u2019s relevant to a personal statement. But like I said, I don\u2019t want to come across as I\u2019m making up for something.\n\nSo, is this type of stuff something that is okay to discuss in a personal statement especially if I think it\u2019s relevant and could set me apart from other applicants? Sorry for the long winded post. Thanks",

      "text": "Programmes are egotistic if they think non-U.S. unis are subordinate to U.S. unis. If that's the vibe you get from your inquiry into prospective PhD programmes', best steer clear of them.\n\nThat said, what got me into my PhD programme is the kinds of questions I'm asking, the interventions I'm hoping to make in the field, and how my prior experience shapes interests. Notice I don't downplay myself by discussing why I chose to apply directly from undergrad--programmes were more interested in my potential as a scholar in my chosen discipline along with the usual things (fit, achievements, fundability, etc.).\n\nIt's quite clear you have the experience. So go hard. Make clear the interventions you want to make in your field. Best of luck!",

For our field, two possible pluses would be (possibly) some familiarity with the archives in the country you are planning to do your research on and (definitely) good foreign language skills if this is a country/region where the primary language is not English.",
