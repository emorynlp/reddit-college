  "text": "I teach an undergrad lab which requires 10 labs to be turned in throughout the semester.\nIt's the end of the semester. I'm done with all my finals and I've finished all my grading  right before the end of this week. Final grades are officially due next Monday, but my advisor needs them early because he has to input the grades himself.\n\nI'm about to send him the final grades from my class when I receive a frantic email from a student at 11:55pm. She just saw I posted the final exam grades and she's concerned about passing the class. She's only turned in 3/10 if the labs and she wants to know if she can still turn them in so she can pass the class. \"I'm set to graduate next semester and it'll be very difficult for me to do so if I don't pass this class\".\n\nI talked to my advisor about it today. He laughed and said it was up to me, but feels that she should just get the F since she obviously didn't try in the class.\n\nI took his advice. I feel bad giving a student an F, but good god I didn't want to grade a bunch more labs.",

      "text": "Grades were released yesterday, save 10% attendance/participation. A student received a 62, 58, 58, and 60 on the four assignments. They emailed my friend (the TA) asking to be bumped up a bit in the participation and final essay, because they didn't get the 65 they need to proceed in the program. This student needed something like 113% on the final essay and 100% in participation to pass. They never got a single grade above 62, never emailed, never came for help, never spoke to her. And it's just now donning on them that they won't pass with a 65???? After everything is handed in, and you've seen all of these low grades come in all semester?? Some of these students baffle me, because they're not the only one.\n\nAnd keep in mind, it's not a 65 to pass the class, is a 65 to be allowed to move forward in the entire program..",

      "text": "I felt a similar struggle teaching a composition course this quarter, my very first time instructing. I'm often reminded by my peers, therapist, and loved ones how into my work and passionate I am, considering that it took me until undergrad' to finally succeed in education. Teaching students from all different majors, however, made me realize how many other students don't care or contribute when trying to earn good grades.\n\nNow, a majority of my students passed the class, while only 25% actually not passing. Despite the division of grades, or the clear evidence of students simply not caring about the work, I had several students contest me on why they should pass the class (or be saved). One example was a student who I'll call Grace. She was energetic and youthful, very much someone excited about being at a new level if not new position with age. Alas, she came to class on her phone, asleep, and hardly participating, never asking questions; yet, when I would hand  work back, she would flag me down during or after class to explain why I gave her marks and/or low results. I emphasized that she needed to perform tasks as discussed in lecture, and she would simply return with, \"So how do I do that?\"\n\nI've learned that the students who really want to succeed are going to show up and do so. If not, and if they do show signs of struggling, they realistically must expect that they must ask for help or guidance. It's impossible for us to save them, putting all effort on our end instead of theirs (it takes one to save another, just as it takes one to succeed on their own effort).\n\nWhile your professor's comment (or laughter) makes me wince, I support you for doing the right thing and giving the student the grade that they deserved. It hurts having to be the one to make the hard decisions, but if they were actually going to graduate the following quarter, then it was up to them to put the work in to do so.",

I just lost interest and started doing the bare minimum. It caught up with me when I realized I failed two classes. I didn't petition either of my teachers - I understand it was my own fault, but it was an eye opener. I wanted to attend grad school. This is a terrible mindset. But it was definitely the kick in the butt that I needed. I reconnected with faculty and applied to a ton of internships for the summer hoping to get back on track.

When i put grades in, they come up to me and ask \"Mister, why do i have an F?\"  Hmmm, I wonder why.  Given I also work at a school for at risk kids, so it's expected.  Our jobs also involve teaching them important character values that their parents didn't.  But it is difficult because most of that character building its cemented in when they are children.  Often we find that kids will change when get to their junior/ senior year when they get some revaluation, but this also means they've missed 11 years of instruction and are struggling to make up for it.  So when a kid from this kind of background goes to college, they being this kind of attitude with them.\n\nOn one hand i feel for that person because college is 10000 dollars and year (if you were a cheap ass like me and went to a cheap school) plus opportunity costs of not working vs high school which is virtually free.  So not graduating has the potential of completely upheaving a person's livelihood.\n\nOn the other hand, as educators, we can't affirm this kind of behavior.  Sometimes you can get away with stuff like this in the real world, but if you make it a habit, then it tarnishes the reputation of the education system, completely waters down the usefulness of grades (which are already a shitty way of measuring skill), and turns kids into crappy workers.\n\nIf it were me I'd probably split the difference, let her complete the labs and give her the lowest possible passing grade.",

It was all automated too so even if the professor wanted to be nice, they physically can't raise your grade.

The professor can support your application, but the decision whether to penalise you or not isn't up to them because their relationship with you shouldn't impact your grade.\n\nBy the end of the first year, the people who couldn't cope failed out or voluntarily left. Everyone who remained got good grades because they knew they had to stick to the rules. It's a tough system, but it's fair across the board. I think it's unfair to have left this decision up to you, but don't feel bad for failing someone who doesn't deserve to pass.",

My current department has a zero-tolerance policy (online submission time at 11:59pm, if the submission is even 10 seconds late it's a zero). Some faculty find this problematic and individually extend or ignore the standardized policy based on individual preference, sometimes without the student reaching out. This causes a lot of, \"Well, Dr. A let me turn things in late!\" It's a nightmare.\n\nI worked at a different program that allowed individual faculty to dictate their own late-work policies and that worked a LITTLE better because at least each individual professor enforced their own policies consistently.",

It's supposed to show that you know shit, not that you could afford 8 semesters of tuition. Plus letting incompetent people into the workplace with a degree from your school actively hurts you. It only takes one terrible employee to sour a manager from a school. Especially if it's a non local school.",

Likely, if this is the type of student she is - she won't get one to begin with unless she knows somebody (which is it's own kind of BS). I was posing this more as a question asking if OP wanted to carry the weight of making a choice that could financially burden the student in today's economy. The student deserved the F, and the OP shouldn't have remorse, but sometimes our empathy fights our logical reasoning and we end up hating the choices we have to make. It's a lose lose - yes, it's not OP's fault, and it's a stupid situation to exist. The 'worth it' had more to do with OP, and less about the student's future - which I'm sure, regardless of anything OP has done, will likely not be too great with their work ethic as is.",

She was a hot mess, and turned in 3/10 HW assignments. One weekend, we spent 7 hours studying together. That test was the first one she didn't fail. The professor was so amazed by the effort he could see that *she clearly put in* (and she did. I witnessed it*)*, that he volunteered to allow her to submit her missing 7 assignments late. Did he have to? No. But his compassion gave her a new respect for his profession, made her more excited and invested in class, and motivated her to pass.\n\n Everyone gets so stand-offish about being compassionate, but it's hard to get a job if you ARE qualified - so i don't think that was the concern for the student here. I don't think OP was trying to work out weather or not to let her into the work force, just if they were willing to accept being the disciplinarian, and holding them accountable for what they did (and therefore causing them inconvenience caused by their own stupidity). Not everyone wants to do that, and to OP's credit, they did - and I think their concern is more telling about the sort of caring and mindful person they are - and also how good their judgement is, that they consider these things carefully.",
