  "text": "I know, I know. So many of these posts, but seriously, it feels like an accomplishment. Just finished my first semester after changing my degree. I'm feeling nervous, but optimistic as I continue my thesis work and look into further research and even a possible business down the road. Projects turned in, thesis on track, grades for the classes I teach submitted - I'm all set to binge all the shows that are about to drop new episodes. And I'm actually excited to do more school work over break instead of the normal feeling of crashing and sleeping through it.",
