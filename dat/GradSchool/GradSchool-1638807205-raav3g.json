  "text": "My PhD defense is about 5 weeks from now and I'm really nervous that I'm not going to be prepared for it.\n\nI have been working part-time during my PhD and I just landed a full-time job. I quit my part-time job with my last day being 12 days from today, and then I start my new job the following week. I asked my new employer if it was possible to start after my defense but they said they prefer I start as soon as possible because they are quite busy and need to train me. They said they are happy to give me some days off prior to my defense to make sure I am prepared for it. I've been trying to find the time and energy to study when I'm not working but I'm worried that it will become more difficult once I start my new job. I'll pretty much only have evenings and weekends to study. My PI knows I work part-time and is aware that I've been looking for a full-time job since I was nearing the end of writing my dissertation. \n\nI'm really anxious that I'm going to be unprepared for my defense and fail. How likely is it to fail a PhD defense? Has anyone here worked full-time while preparing for a defense? Any advice or reassurances are welcome. Thanks!",

From what you've outlined, it doesn't sound like you've got any major issues, just anxiety surrounding your defense (which is normal).  I'm sure you've got this!",

This is known as [reappraisal](https://pha.berkeley.edu/2018/12/01/getting-excited-over-anxiety/), and you'll be surprised by how much it can reduce your nervousness. Good luck!",

And the student kept pushing for the defense. So the committee finally gave in because they were essentially a lost cause. The advisor did not tell them they were ready.\n\nIt was a fellow grad student, and none of us who had had classes with that person were surprised.",
