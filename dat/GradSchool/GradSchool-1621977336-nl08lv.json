Take a break, enjoy it guilt-free, and you'll come back to work with a zing and concentration. Same with lunch breaks! If you can't convince yourself to take a break for mental health reasons (which you absolutely should do), look at it from the quality of work angle. You need breaks to do better work.",

      "text": "Comrade, I'm so sorry to hear you're experiencing this. It pains me to know so many of us are dealing with over-work and under-appreciation. One thing I've learned (the hard way) is that if you don't set healthy work boundaries, people are very liable to break them. I am a couple months out from graduation and was working 12-14 hr days and pulling all-nighters once a week trying to meet unreasonable deadlines. I didn't start forcing myself to do something good for my body and brain once a day until my health finally started deteriorating and was starting to lose my hair from stress. You can still be a good student/worker if you put yourself first, the work will still get done even if it takes an extra day or two. Sleep in and take a half or full day off on the weekend, it'll give your brain a break and you'll be sharper the next day. Take a 30 min walk outside in the sun. Smell the flowers. If your university offers counseling services, I cannot recommend them enough. Mental and physical health is such a precious thing that we as students need to protect, don't let the pyramid scheme that is academia guilt you into destroying it. Life is too short.",

Let\u2019s be real, unless someone is a passenger of our sinking ship they don\u2019t really realize why we can\u2019t just \u201ctake a break\u201d. So here\u2019s how I\u2019ve kept myself (barely) afloat and (so-far) breakdown free this year:\n-enjoy the little moments away from the desk like listening to a comedy podcast while taking a shower (even though I know some days there isn\u2019t time to take a shower, gross but true)\n-eat breakfast and make sure it has fiber and protein and don\u2019t eat after 8pm, this\u2019ll help how your body manage it\u2019s units of energy and will help you make the most of what little time you have to sleep \n-do 10 min of some sort of moderate exercise every morning if you can (I\u2019ve looked up 10 min apartment-friendly hiit workouts and they\u2019re perfect) it\u2019ll get the blood flowing and you\u2019ll be able to focus \n-keep the music and tv off when you\u2019re working. If you\u2019re going to spend hours grinding you may as well *grind*\n-drink water, set alarms on your phone if you always forget to, just do it \n-5mg of melatonin a night to make sure you\u2019re getting deep sleep and actually recovering \n-allow yourself to call a friend and just bitch about life and let it all out once in a while\n-have stuff to look forward to! It can literally be a ordering takeout from your fav restaurant one night a week, if that gets you through to work then do it! \n\nMost importantly remember why you\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s HELL now but remember your end goal!! You got this, this pain is temporary, this pain will pay off!!",

For a bit over a month now, I've been immersed in my fieldwork daily, while also trying to recruit interview respondents (at first, it was going well, and now has completely stagnated) and get my really brief survey out (which I have been trying to do ever since I got to the field and it's just been passed off to different people over and over). Nobody is emailing me back, updating me on anything, etc. Things were going so well, and now this week, I have one interview scheduled, which was a cancellation from last week. \n\nI'm basically taking this week off from stretching myself so thin, especially due to the pervasive feelings of discouragement, stress, and actually feeling rather depressed the last couple days. I mean, I still have been doing some work (interviews completed have been fully transcribed, edited, and formatted, and that obviously takes up a lot of time) on top of putting together a guest lecture due tomorrow, and doing some content analysis-type coding for a small hourly position for a friend who got a small (very small) grant to hire me to help. \n\nI'm not telling my advisor about this week. She does not need to know that I am taking the week off from fieldwork so I do not completely lose my mind. She knows I've been working very hard and that I will persist. Do you really need to tell your advisor about your feelings of burnout if you could otherwise try to guilt-free allow yourself a few days off of work? \n\nMy advisor prefers to be hands-off, which is how I do best as well, so maybe yours is more like helicopter parent version of an advisor, I don't know. But take a break. Don't tell your advisor. If you keep pushing too hard, you'll end up in a really bad spot that could really disrupt things and cause issues with your advisor. \n\nTake a couple/few days off. It's better than having a complete breakdown that absolutely will grind your research to a halt.",
