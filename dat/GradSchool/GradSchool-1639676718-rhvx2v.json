  "text": "What are the tips, tricks, and strategies people have used to get through graduate school with good marks and a deep understanding of their subject(s)? Especially for more quantitative programs?\n\nI'm just starting out with pre-requisites (online) but I was never a very focused student in undergrad/high school either. I love the act of learning and am fascinated while in class, but the fact is I just skated by on easier classes in my earlier life and would only get down to studying last minute before finals and projects. Now that everything is online its even more difficult for me to \"buckle down\" and just study or watch the lectures (they are not live).\n\nI'm planning on trying for a masters in Data Science or Computer Science, and while I love the subject matter, I continually screw myself over by not going at a reasonable, consistent pace through even easier courses.\n\nI'm reasonably intelligent but no where near the level needed to just skate through graduate or even undergraduate quant courses the way I seem privy to do.  I really want to pursue graduate studies to switch fields, yet I continually get in my own way as I never cultivated the skills and strategies for consistent, dedicated focus.",

      "text": "Discipline is a transferable skill, so practice it in a different area that's more concrete and gratifying. Exercise, a complex hobby, a new language, or any sort of DIY passion project. \n\nUse a day planner. Make a timeline for yourself, and keep it manageable. Start with something you know you can do. Success builds confidence, and confidence builds motivation, which builds capacity to utilize more cognitive resources.\n\nLast, be honest about how legitimately boring some classes are. Like, they're total bullshit, and sometimes, completely wasting your time. There's some great lectures, and then some... well we all know. Trust that your own emotions are reliable, and if you're tuning out, it's not because you're lazy, or weak, or incompetent. Your own brain is rolling your eyes whether you want to or not. You might think like, \"But I still have to do it\". Of course, but do it in the same way you do dishes, laundry, or grocery shopping. Don't let it undermine your core beliefs like that love of learning. Otherwise you risk attributing genuine boredom or poor quality teaching to your own character, which can lead to a loss of passion and eventual self doubt.",

      "text": "This is a great topic that can be expanded at multiple levels. On the one hand, there are \"tools of the trade\" that can support productivity and focus. One the other hand, many of the things that cause us to get in our own way are related to imbalances and lack of clarity in our life.\n\nYour experience is a lot like mine in undergraduate, I wasn't focused. Graduate school was a place for me to learn how to focus and be self-driven. It doesn't happen overnight. Each week, small improvements are great.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges people face is their own internal pressure and judgement. This often causes more stress, leading people to not feel rested, leading to more anxieties and self-judgement -> a bad cycle. \n\nSelf-kindness and compassion are much more powerful than judgement and pressure. These can be used to create real change - as well as help us recognize when we do really just need to rest.\n\nI know there's no practical tips here. Others, I believe, will offer ample of those. Best of luck to you!",
