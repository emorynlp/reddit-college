  "title:": "Need help with GRE score options (#1: 159V/154Q/5.5AWA, #2: 162V/149Q/6AWA) for Sociology PhD applications",
  "text": "I posted about this about a week or so ago in r/gradadmissions but I was kind of ranting more than asking for advice so now I'd like to just put this out in a clear way.\n\nSo I am applying to Sociology programs in the U.S., having gotten my Bachelor's in Media Studies with a minor in Psychology and worked as a financial reporter for the past two years.\n\nA lot of programs are test-optional this year, but I figured the GRE would help bolster my application and highlight my reasoning skills to make up for such a humanities-heavy background. The first time I took the test after minimal studying, I got a 159V/154Q/5.5AWA. I knew I could bring up the verbal score by at least a few points and wanted to try and boost my qualitative score as much as possible too, so I scheduled a second test and started studying my butt off.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nThe night before my GRE, my dad almost died and was rushed to the hospital for an emergency open-heart surgery. He is doing well now, but as you can imagine, I didn't get much sleep that night (maybe 2 hours) and was mentally very preoccupied. ETS, being the clowns that they are, would not let me reschedule. Luckily, I have always done well in reading/writing and somehow managed to pull off a 162V and a perfect (6.0) AWA score. Math, on the other hand... not so much. In my exhausted state, I ended up getting a 149Q, my personal worst!\n\nNow I'm not sure how to proceed with most of my applications due between 12/1 and 1/15. Some schools allow me to submit both scores, but would it be too much/come off like I'm trying to make up excuses if I explain why my qualitative score tanked? Others only allow one score to be submitted. Should I sacrifice showing off my great verbal and analytical writing scores to at least show I can perform quantitative reasoning at a middling level? Should I just not submit scores at all and just hope for the best?\n\nHoping someone can offer some clarity. I apologize in advance if this is not the right place!",
