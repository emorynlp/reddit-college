Higher level research positions in biotech and pharma are almost exclusively populated by PhDs and MDs. \n\nWhat I'd recommend is finding individuals that are doing the type of work you want to do, and reaching out to them for advice. (LinkedIn may be useful). Many people are happy to talk about themselves and give advice to those that want to follow their paths.",
