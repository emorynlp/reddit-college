The paper concluded by saying that there wasn't enough high quality experimental data and that more was needed.\n\nNow, I could go and read those 15-20 studies that he reviewed and come to the same conclusion. Or, I could take his word for it and trust the peer review process. Since my work doesn't require those studies _directly_, there would be a high opportunity cost to taking the time out and reading those papers.

The choice to rely on the lit review (and, it seems, not to identify the lit review as the source of your knowledge about those sources) suggests you're unconcerned with whether or not you end up inaccurately referring to those sources via details provided in the lit review. That's fine and all but deals with a different question (namely, \"Why might one decide to cite a paper without reading it?\") than the one asked at the beginning of this particular thread of comments.\n\nSo, to circle back around to the question ... poorly.",
