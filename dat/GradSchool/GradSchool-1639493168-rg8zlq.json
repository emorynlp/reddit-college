  "text": "I'm a 3rd-year Ph.D. student in pharma-sciences. I am spiraling out. I have been having mental health issues for the past several months and I talked with my PI about this, mentioning that my psych-doc was changing my meds and I didn't know how it was going to affect my work. He seemed to be empathetic and said \"just do your best\". But, over the past few months, I keep getting emails about how poor my work is and just getting yelled at over little things. Every email sends me into a depression and now he wants to have a meeting with me about my performance.\n\n I am hanging on by a thread but I don't really have any options. My salary comes out of a grant from his lab so I can't change labs, I can't quit as I would put my wife and I in serious financial jeopardy, and I've mentioned issues with my meds a few times to him and he is nice about it at the moment and then it's like he forgets or doesn't care - which is frustrating because our area of study is psychiatric medicine!\n\nI feel trapped and hopeless. My meds aren't working, therapy isn't working, and all I keep thinking is \" I hope I don't wake up tomorrow\".",

      "text": "First I just want to say that I am so sorry you are struggling: it\u2019s been a series of stressful years for us all now on top of grad school, and switching up meds is always kind of scary and uncertain. I would recommend finding out what your options are for accommodations or some sort of leave of absence. It sounds to me like the way your PI is responding is negatively impacting your mental health, which has to come first. It sounds like you\u2019re experiencing some passive suicidal ideation, and that trapped feeling won\u2019t go away until something gives so you can get the psychological breathing room you need.",

Don't use his responses as validation or challenges of your self worth or more importantly whether your medical treatment is working. \n\nAlso just keep doing your best. Ask him to provide feedback and address any comments he has. If his behavior is turning to abusive, document it or go through the appropriate mediation channels.",

This might make it more difficult for them to dismiss you if they actually do want to go down that path. It might help talking with someone from your graduate school union about your options",

      "text": "Your salary may come out of his grant money, that\u2019s typical, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can\u2019t change labs. Try to talk to people and explore resources for grad students on your campus, see if there\u2019s a way to get medical leave or if there\u2019s transitional funding for students who do want to switch labs. I too am prone to defeatism and feeling helpless and trapped in times of mental crisis, but you have to do your best to fight those urges and work find out what your options truly are. I also want to repeat what this sub says constantly (and which I also struggle with internalizing), that you are not your work and you are not a failure if you decide this environment isn\u2019t for you. You are human and you deserve to be happy.",

Do you have someone close to you who can help you talk through this?\n\nI agree with u/cutiequeercris comment - it's always helpful to know what your options are so you can best navigate the situation.  If possible, finding some space/time away from university can help you regain perspective - though it sounds like that may be challenging.\n\nIs there a reason you can't get a job somewhere else? Are you an international student? \n\nWishing you good health as you navigate this.",
