  "title:": "Advice: Nervous about my chances of being admitted to a Clinical Psych PhD Program (Masters Student)",
  "text": "Hello r/GradSchool!\n\n\n**A good TLDR is I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any advice regarding applying to PhD programs in clinical/school psych. worried if my CV/stats are competitive enough to get into a PhD psych program and looking for advice.**\n\nI found the applications for PhDs in clinical psychology rather daunting once I realized the admissions statistics. \n\nWhat worries me is that I have a hit-or-miss stats: A 2.9 undergraduate **GPA** with no involvement, but a 4.0 masters GPA while being a TA, GA, and Research Assistant. On the **GRE**, I scored in the 13th percentile for math, but in the 85th for verbal, and in the 98th for writing. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to make up for this by making my applications to seem to have a holistic \u201cpotential for growth\u201d theme. In **letters of recommendation**, I have letters from former professors, clinical supervisors, and work supervisors to highlight how my skill set/potential for growth is showcased in different aspects of my history. \n\nAlso, I tried to construct my resume/CV to primarily showcase how my long work history (abroad and domestic) of being in the education industry as an ESL teacher, instructional coordinator, and set teacher grew my interpersonal skills, behavior management, and crisis management skills (90% of my work history is working with undocumented migrants/refugees).\n\nAny advice would be amazing. I\u2019m just ruminating until the interview process starts \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05",
