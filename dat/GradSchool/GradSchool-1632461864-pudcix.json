  "text": "Sooo the pressure is on.  I am four weeks into my first two classes and essentially failing.  I am embarassed to say the work load has kind of blown my mind.  \nI got spoiled doing pre reqs where there was a grade every week, with few ungraded assignments. \nInstead Grad school has lots of ungraded work and one or two graded assignments.  I was naive and didn\u2019t do most of the ungraded assignments which might have helped improve my grade. \nThe essentially failing part,  I can still get an A in both classes but I estimate my work load is going to 3 to four hours a day vs the three to four hours per week I put in previously. \nAnyways, here\u2019s to coming from behind this semester.",
