  "title:": "I\u2019m in my final year of a Masters degree and today was the first time a professor encouraged me.",
  "text": "And it was very bittersweet.\n\n\nI was in a meeting with my supervisor and another professor who is part of a project with us. In response to my presentation, he made a lot of comments and questions and eventually started sharing some anecdotes of his experience in research.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was. Maybe the fact that his statements always started with \u201cI\u201d which indicated that he is someone with minimal self-awareness. But then he started talking about the research process. Coming up with a hypothesis, the joy of finding an original thought, the struggles of writing and the relief that comes after the first sentence. It hit home. It\u2019s like he took me by the hand and showed me all these cool toys in the playground. He encouraged me to keep going.\n\n\nThen, silence. Before I could acknowledge this pep talk, my own supervisor chimed in. To my surprise, he admitted that this was probably the first time I was receiving encouragement in my grad journey and apologized/messily thanked the professor on my behalf. He admitted that he only gives me negative, often harsh feedback. \n\n\nBefore any of us could respond to that, he shared his own anecdote of his equally harsh supervisor. The way he spoke about it, though he chuckled nervously, it\u2019s clear that his own grad school experience was inhumane and traumatizing. \n\n\nI felt sad for him, but something clicked within me: hurt people hurt people.",

      "text": "I can relate, but when I finally asked for some encouragement in my last few months, she told me \u201cIve always known you can do it so I never needed to tell you that, you just need to believe it yourself and get it done. You shouldnt need other people to tell you what you can do to do what you can do\u201d. And it really hit home because, especially once I go into industry, a PhD program, or academia, whatever, its all going to be stuff I *can* do but that I just need to find it within myself to do it. \n\nShe had never really given me a bad word but never many good either but I realized thats because she wanted me to become confident without *needing* praise from anyone and I think learning that has made me a lot more productive and confident about my defense next week.",

I think every grad student/employee needs to have a certain level of self-efficacy when starting up. It makes it easier for your mentor to actually mentor you, if you already have some motivation and knowledge of yourself and your abilities.",

              "text": "Very true. My biggest issue was that she had no idea what I was doing. She is the director of the clinical micro lab at the vet hospital at our uni, she teaches, and allows our lab to run itself, so when I went to her for help it was kind of general advice so she didnt help much so one day I was just like \u201cDr. _____ Im lost and I dont think I can do this, I need you to give me some feedback or encouragement to get me there\u201d. And she was just like \u201cIf I didnt think you could do this you would have been gone long ago\u201d, hyped me up a bit, and told me to believe in myself because people arent going to be there to hype me up. \n\nI was incredibly lucky to have an amazing post-doc who mentored me on all the science and some of the personal stuff, but it wasnt until that convo with my advisor like 2 months ago lol that I realized she just wanted me to be able to do science like an independent researcher.",

I made a statement regarding the fact I didn't have positive results and after my committee discussed amongst themselves and called everyone back in, my two committee members (not my advisor) said I did a really great job in spite of things going wrong and that I should be proud of myself because I did what I set out to do and what I was supposed to do. It was so nice but man I wish I had gotten that way beforehand. My advisor was not bad but she was absent or very minimally involved and just didn't want me to be one of her other students who took years to graduate. I did it in  just over 2 years. Anyway, I'm glad you heard it when you did and hope you keep getting encouraged. Grad school is hard and we all need a little something to keep going sometimes! I hope you know I'm proud of you!!",

Using \u201cI\u201d statements keeps you accountable to your own reality. It helps your email responsible for your emotions, but still leaves some space for you to express yourself and seek solutions.\n\nIn the case of my supervisor, all his feedback starts with \u201cyou\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand this. Why aren\u2019t you understanding this? You\u2019re not reading enough. You don\u2019t seem interested.
