  "title:": "Can I reach out to a potential advisor during my junior year of college?",
  "text": "Hello, \n\nI am a junior in college planning to apply to bioengineering PhD programs next year. I have a potential advisor that I am very certain I want to work for, I've been following his work for a long time and his work has been the blueprint of my dreams. I know most phd applicants reach out to their potential advisors during the summer before the application cycle, but I was wondering if there is any advantage/disadvantage of reaching out early (and possibly ask questions about his research, what I can do to better prepare my time in graduate school, etc). He is also one of the biggest professors in his field, which is also part of the reason I wanted to reach out as soon as possible, even though I'm not even sure he will ever reply or even read my email. \n\nAny input will be highly appreciated, thank you all!",

      "text": "Yes you can and I did that too while approaching professors for PhD after graduating. I got a chance to talk to a lot of potential supervisors even before my senior year with a couple of them ready to accept me in their lab. Incase you have a strong research experience, I will suggest you to go ahead and talk to them. If that doesn't work, you can still volunteer for their lab and work with them during your senior year.",

      "text": "Yeah as others have said, don't expect an immediate or even a response at all but make it friendly and show a keen interest. \n\nI did and I ended up getting a meeting + successful application with the supervisor. I read their most cited paper (not always a good metric) and asked for a meeting to discuss the project. \n\nI asked questions from the literature which sparked a good discussion.\n\nThe application process for PhDs in my area (UK) is a bit weird but if you keep at it you'll surely find success.",
