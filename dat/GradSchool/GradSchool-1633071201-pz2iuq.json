  "text": "I'm at a crossroads and can't decide between thesis and a co-op based program, I don't want to get into academia, I prefer working in the industry, so the only reason I want to do a thesis based Master's is because of the funding.\n\nI'd just like to ask a few questions regarding thesis and co-op based Master's that'll help me figure out what's right for me.\n\n* Were you ever at a disadvantage/advantage compared to a thesis route graduate going into the industry? (Especially if the industry job was software engineering or web development, I'm sure AI/ML research would help get better and more specialized jobs.)\n* How was the pay during the internship?\n* Did you work a job or a TAship during the terms you studied? If so, how manageable was that?",
