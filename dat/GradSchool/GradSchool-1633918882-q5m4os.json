  "text": "So I just wrote this \n\n[https://www.astronomaestro.com/2021/10/should-you-pursue-astrophysics.html](https://www.astronomaestro.com/2021/10/should-you-pursue-astrophysics.html)\n\nTLDR;\n\nI am a grad student pursuing astronomy at the moment. I started at a University that had no real reputation in physics, with me having no background in Physics, and now I'm a grad student studying at one that has quite a reputation.\n\nMy experience has been quite a roller coaster ride. From one emotional high to another emotional low to an emotional high, to another new low and on and on and on.\n\nMy experience has been those in academia being quite supportive vocally. But, in reality, I have found that there is no real promise of anything. Over and over again, even if you have talent and proof of your ability, there is no promise of a future and most academics simply are apathetic (some do care but many just don't).\n\nMaybe I am screaming into the void here, but fricking heck I'm getting tired of the shenanigans of academia.\n\nWhy is it like this? Why does this ridiculous culture of academia exist where you don't have any stability until after a 20 year slog when you might get tenure? Why preach about being inclusive when they've built a system that is entirely designed to preserve their exclusivity?\n\nMaybe some might try to defend what is there, or say that because I don't have a hard solution that we stick with what we have.\n\nBut seriously, I had more stable career when I was cashiering at Wal-Mart than the average astrophysics grad/post doc. That's kind of sad after 10+ years of education.\n\nok I'm done ranting. If anyone has any thoughts, I'd be open to hear them.",

      "text": "People keep saying that the problem is there are too many grad students but the reality is that there aren't enough permanent research jobs. We want a certain amount of research to be done but taxpayers and universities also don't want to pay for it, so the cheapest way to get a lot of cheap labor is to have grad students do the work. Even better if those grad students can serve to move federal research funding into university coffers through \"tuition\" that pays for exactly no classroom instruction. As a result, faculty have to recruit aggressively into grad programs, leading to a lot of people with no serious interest in academic work spending years in grad school then doubling down because they've already put so much work towards the career path, because it's hard as hell and expensive as hell to just hire a staff scientist.",

This doesn't get fixed without serious attention to the problem from federal funding agencies, limiting the number of students funded through their programs and limiting the amount of money universities can make by assessing \"tuition\" for these students. These are both major parts of the problem which encourage recruitment of students who gave no real interest in academia into academic-track work, and that's just sociopathic.",

Just empower ourselves a bit in that sense, which is something within our immediate control.",

We had this material sciences professor at our university who was some doing some really good research into nanomaterials. He was given tenure and then in a short while he just gave up on his lab and now writes shitty poems on Facebook. I am not saying I am 100 % certain tenure gave him this complacency but the university could have easily let his contract expire and gotten rid of this useless clown if it wasn't for tenure. This is obviously anecdotal and I know there are probably many good people who made good on there tenure. \n\nThe idea being people who are passionate about what they do will find the process of writing grant proposals to be a minor annoyance rather than some  life threatening calamity.

It's very obvious to almost everyone that there is a two birds one stone solution to the problems of academic hiring *and* poor standard of living for grad students. Just hire fewer grad students. If you're a program and you're going to bring on 8 students at 30k stipend, bring on 4 students at 60k instead. Over a few years, you have a smaller influx into the pool of people looking for academic jobs, and grad students can actually afford to live decent lives. This of course doesn't happen bc universities rely on the cheap labor of a large group of grad students to do research. It really is a travesty.",

There's a fair bit of work we can do. The pay can be quite poor, agreed. But its not universally the case to the point where its impossible to land a gig. And more to the point I'd say the sort of stability we can get via jobs like teaching at the school level, doing industry work like publishing, working in institutions, etc isn't that far off in terms of job security as what our non-academic counterparts get from their degrees. Academia is difficult, but we're not being churned out without any prospects. We just need to be somewhat flexible and realistic about what our options are.\n\nAnd I will say this... as much as I would love the pay scales of what tech bros can get, or a coder's degree can manage...

You probably won't be doing the fanciest of the fancy methods, but there's a reason why until very recently when schools started adding data science degrees, physics PhD was the quintessential data science background. There's also a perspective component that's hard to quantify. A lot of \"physics finance\" and \"physics economics\" was a brazen attempt by physicists to get hired by investment banks and is crap because of that (my favorite is the person that used QFT to calculate bid-ask spreads assuming a random walk model and got random walk scaling laws), but there is probably something to be said for using non equilibrium statistical mechanics tools for parts of finance. It fits at a high level at least.\n\nAnd keep in mind when I say \"not worth it\" I mean from a maximizing your wealth viewpoint. You will still objectively be wealthy. You just won't ever catch up to someone who just got a degree that pays well out of undergrad because you make nothing for 6 years.",

At least in mathematics, one can see this quite clearly through the Mathematics Genealogy website.\n\nI try my best to be as brutally honest about the odds of landing a tenure-track position at a research university, and how it\u2019s important to have a backup plan. A significant fraction of my graduate students willingly chose to go into industry, and they get great jobs that command a very high salary, and make use of their technical skills, so it\u2019s not necessarily the case that the issue is overadmitting students into PhD programs. What is problematic is pretending that every PhD student is going to get a tenure-track job at a major research university, and not providing them with the opportunity to develop a well-rounded skillset that would allow them to be competitive for non-academic positions.",

A PhD is training to be a specialist, and by being a \"specialist\" you won't be ubiquitous, so you will not have that job security. No specialists have as good job security as a cashier unless there are few of them and they are in very high demand. This isn't a problem unique to academia.\n\nNO ONE is guaranteed to get a job offer after they graduate, not even computer science graduates and business majors. Astrophysics will never *guarantee* a job unless astrophysics positions become necessary for every grocery store. The field will never be inclusive in that way.

You may be thinking of it on an individual level -- most individual scientists don't make economic impacts by themselves -- but on aggregate public money spent on scientific research more than pays for itself. Some sources to this effect:\n\nhttps://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-016-0564-z\n> This spillover effect implies a real annual rate of return (in terms of economic impact) to public biomedical and health research in the UK of 15\u201318 %. When combined with previous estimates of the health gain that results from public medical research in cancer and cardiovascular disease, the total rate of return would be around 24\u201328 %. [...] The implied historical returns from UK government and charity funded investment in medical research in the UK compare favourably with the rates of return achieved on investments in the rest of the UK economy and are greatly in excess of the 3.5 % real annual rate of return required by the UK government to public investments generally.\n\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/research/localizing-the-economic-impact-of-research-and-development/\n> ... economists estimate that a 1 percent increase in the U.S. R&D capital stock improves GDP by 0.13 percent.",

The sources you link conflate all sorts of \"research\" of which academia comprises only a small percentage. The economic return does not appear to be made explicit, my guess is that if sussed out completely it would be \"near-zero\" even if it ended up being \"statistically significant\".\n\nIf I have missed something obvious, please let me know.\n\nMy general suspicion is this: Private and applied research make bank -> this is reflected in ROI on \"research\"-> academic research is casually collapsed under this linguistic umbrella of \"research\" generically-> people assume it is academic research (the most psychologically available example in people's minds) that comprises the majority of this return when reading figures on research expenditure.\n\nAcademic research may provide value in other ways though: having entertaining explanations for phenomena, a prestige market for basic research competition, the joy of discovery. It is also probably wasteful economically. The good thing is though, that we can probably afford to be wasteful.\n\nEDIT: I will actually qualify this last point. It is \"wasteful\" if the only thing you care about is dollars. It is not wasteful if you view spending on academic research as the process of buying valuable things even if they do not represent an economic return. Knowledge can be innately valuable to some, though the public's collective willingness-to-pay may be much lower than what the average r/gradschool poster would find satisfying.",

It should be something you do because you're interested, not because you are looking for a job after. That realization was really hard for me as a first generation student. I honestly had 0 idea that the job market was so bad, and even if I did I'm not really sure I would have known what that meant. Especially since so much can change in a few years when you are doing your degree.\n\nBut I think departments need to do so much more to make students aware of this dire situation and actively provide training for alternative opportunities.
