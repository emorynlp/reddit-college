  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m currently in undergrad with a 3.588 gpa. I have almost entirely a\u2019s, two b+ (maybe 3) and a b. I also have a c- in intro psych, as a psych major. My freshman year I took this course and got a d- because I was on drugs, and I got the c- during the first wave of COVID because I lost my housing and was in a terrible situation. My gpa would be a 3.7 otherwise and my grades have been rising the longer I\u2019m in school. \nWould retaking it again look bad? I feel like that gpa jump is really notable\u2026 I can\u2019t get it cause I\u2019m almost a senior. I\u2019m looking to pursue behavioral neuro and my major is psych, minor in chem and neuro. I\u2019m sort of having a mental breakdown because I can\u2019t not get a PhD to do what I want, I\u2019m struggling to find applicable experience because none of my profs will let me on for research for some reason (I\u2019m going to look in chem department since there\u2019s more opportunities) and I\u2019ve had to work throughout most of college so I feel like I have nothing going for me. I haven\u2019t got a B since I got sober; I\u2019m just lost and if I can\u2019t obtain this goal I feel like everything is just pointless.",
