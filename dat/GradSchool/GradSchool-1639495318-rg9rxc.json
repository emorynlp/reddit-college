  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m currently in undergrad with a 3.588 gpa. I have almost entirely a\u2019s, two b+ (maybe 3) and a b. I also have a c- in intro psych, as a psych major. My freshman year I took this course and got a d- because I was on drugs, and I got the c- during the first wave of COVID because I lost my housing and was in a terrible situation. My gpa would be a 3.7 otherwise and my grades have been rising the longer I\u2019m in school. \nWould retaking it again look bad? I feel like that gpa jump is really notable\u2026 I can\u2019t get it cause I\u2019m almost a senior. I\u2019m looking to pursue behavioral neuro and my major is psych, minor in chem and neuro. I\u2019m sort of having a mental breakdown because I can\u2019t not get a PhD to do what I want, I\u2019m struggling to find applicable experience because none of my profs will let me on for research for some reason (I\u2019m going to look in chem department since there\u2019s more opportunities) and I\u2019ve had to work throughout most of college so I feel like I have nothing going for me. I haven\u2019t got a B since I got sober; I\u2019m just lost and if I can\u2019t obtain this goal I feel like everything is just pointless.",

      "text": "If your school is one of those places that lets it replace the original grade, and it's significantly raises your GPA, that could be a good thing. A much higher GPA might get someone to pay more attention to your application package then they otherwise would.\n\nAnd then in your personal statement, you might be able to talk about how you had a rough start in school, and then realized that psychology was for you. You wouldn't be the first undergraduate that had a tough start. Then if they happen to notice it on the transcript, they'll understand why you retook it.",

I\u2019ve been nervous about the personal statement because I\u2019m not sure how to put \u201cI got heavily addicted to heroin and almost died but I\u2019m fine now and doing really well\u201d into words that sound right but I need to figure it out.",

In other words, use it to show your motivation and your focus within the field.",

                      "text": "I had a very similar experience. Your statement of purpose is to showcase your academic self in the best light possible. Leading with addiction issues may come off as unprofessional partly because that is not the purpose of the professional statement. You are typically only allotted so many words, so i would lean into your experiences and how you have grown academically. \n\nI had a few c's and an f on my transcript, but it was clear that something externally was affecting my GPA. Towards the end of my undergrad my GPA was much better, and admissions committees pay close attention to that. They aren't going to worry about how well you did in your first few classes of school, they look at the whole application.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions. I am a first year PhD student with a very similar background to you, so I understand how it can be.",

And like u/sweatyshambler said, it typically doesn't go in a personal statement.\n\nBut in your case, if it has influenced your direction and motivation in psychology, then you bring it in that way if it's important to define who you would be academically in the discipline.",
