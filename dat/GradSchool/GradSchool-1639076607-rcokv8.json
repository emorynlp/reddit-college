  "text": "I'm a PhD student coming up to the end of my second semester. I have a MSc already so I'm able to transfer credits, so after next semester I will have fulfilled my course requirements aside from one more semester in our required seminar. For reference, most students in my program usually take classes for 5 semesters, so I'm about a year ahead. This works out really well for me because I want to be able to spend as much of my time here as possible focusing on research, writing and publishing, getting teaching experiences, etc etc. I know that I want to stay in academia because I was involved in research all throughout undergrad so I've known for years that I love it, and I enjoyed TAing this semester as well. So when planning out next semester, I asked my supervisors about TAing more, and they told me that because I am funded through a grant for research specifically, I'm not supposed to do teaching experiences beyond the requirements to graduate. I worked with a professor that I want to TA for to convince them to let me do it again next semester, with the condition that this will be the last time I do so. \n\nSeeing as I am not going to have a formal education on teaching skills, I feel like getting as much experience as possible should be the goal, so that I can be prepared to teach a whole class, so it seems a little silly that there would be restrictions on it! I do understand it from a funding standpoint, since I'm not being paid to teach, but if I'm willing to volunteer my time towards something I believe will help me professionally, why put restrictions on it? And especially since I will be done with classwork after next semester and will therefore have more time, it seems counterproductive! What's weirder, I'd been considering joining a music ensemble for fun and to destress, although ultimately decided against it for next semester, but my supervisors said I could look into it for next fall. Why would it be more acceptable to join a university orchestra than to get more teaching experience? \n\nI'm not really that upset about it and if I can't do more beyond next semester it isn't the end of the world, I just think it's strange! Have any other PhD students on federal funding for research run into this issue? Did you find a way to work around it, or did you just have to deal?",

      "text": "First, paid positions are paid positions and teaching is a paid contract position at a university. You can't just volunteer and start teaching undergraduate classes at any university I know of.\n\nSecond, your research position is also a contract position and most regulated workplaces can't allow employees in one contract position to do the work of another contract position without pay. It will look like there's pressure being put on you to do it and end up getting them in trouble with unions or labor boards (even if in your case you really do want to do it and nobody is pressuring you to).\n\nIn the fourth year of my PhD, I took an adjunct position at a 2-year college as a second job. I had to get okay from my department for that as well as an equivalency at the school I started teaching at since I didn't have my degree yet, but teaching as teacher-of-record is much better experience than TAing if this is something you want to do.",

      "text": "TA is rough, mentally draining but the good and kind students keep you sane, and I would rather do research than TA. So you should be glad. Additionally you are being paid to do research; your advisor expects great results (at least a paper by a year). Don\u2019t ruin your chance with them. Besides if the funding is via the institution, you cannot perform both positions as it takes away money from another student.",

If they let you teach for free, they might not get the funding for the position the next time. \n\nThat being said, you might check back with whomever does the TA staffing and scheduling right at the beginning of the semester. In case someone bailed, and they are desperate to staff a position.  \n\nSome department's at some institutions bend their own rules in that circumstance. I had a teaching assistantship, and twice during graduate school, I got to teach an extra section above what was alotted to me and get paid by picking up an extra section in an emergency like that.",

      "text": "At my university TA positions are prioritized to students who do not have external/RA funding, so doing it when you're contracted to something else would be taking away from people who would be otherwise left without funding.  That being said, I know several profs in my department have had grad students help out in the actual lecture (as opposed to teaching labs, which is the TA's role).  Maybe reach out to a prof and ask if you could help out in other ways?\n\nEdit to add: Plus, your future employers will care more about what you accomplished in your grad career than how much you TA'd.",
