  "title:": "Left off of publication I worked on",
  "text": "I recently found out I was left off of a publication that I worked on extensively as as undergraduate. It was a health behavior intervention study with two studies reported within. I was heavily involved with the first study, including organizing all data collection, running analyses, and presenting the study at multiple academic conferences across 2 years. I even designed and created a brochure containing health information that we gave to participants. This brochure was a key piece of the intevention. \n\nYesterday, I became aware that this study was accepted into a fairly highly ranked journal in the field of health psychology. The PI included three former undergraduate students from both before and after my tenure. As a graduate student now, I am aware that not all undergraduates contribute enough to be included on academic publications; however, I am certain that my contributions warranted authorship and yet didn't even recieve an acknowledgement. There is even a picture of me on the university's website presenting this study at a conference.\n\n**Is there any sort of process/best practice to remediate this?** \n\nAdditional Details: I still use the PI for letters of recommendation and we occasionally send friendly emails to catch up. I also plan to talk to my current PhD advisor about this to get their input and fill in the specific details (i.e., journal name, more specific contrubutions, etc.). The university where the PI is located is an undergradaute only teaching college so there are no graduate students. In this lab I worked as the lab manager and contributed to projects about as much as a grdaute student typically would. \n\nTL;DR: Former PI didn't include me on a paper I worked on extensively. Is there anyway to remediate this?",

You're not the one with the fuckup, the PI (potentially) is the one who made the error and should be the one to correct it. \n\nGiven the amount of work you did, and that other undergrads were also included, it does seem really odd that you were not included as an author. It also seems silly when there's literally a picture of you presenting that research. If you weren't an author, why would you present someone else's work?",

      "text": "i would agree with most of the comments in the thread: talk to your PI in a friendly way first. Your PI needs to give a very solid and valid argument to explain this outcome, as I believe you have the right to authorship. But before you take think about what you will tell and what your former PI might argue with: as the tasks you did that you mentioned here are a bit arguable. Did you plan the \"experiments\", di you perform them? In which way did you analyze the data, i.e. you did comprehensive calculations and statistical tests to determine significant ones? In which way do you organize the data, i.e. make some visualization? Making plots only do not guarantee the place in the authorship list, but acknowledgement - yes. And present the study in the conference is not enough to publish too. I don't want to sound rude or intimidating (sorry if do), but it is crucial to be ready for these questions for the talk to your PI.",
