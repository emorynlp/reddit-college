      "text": "Basically you'll explain your hypothesis, then explain your methodology, why you think it is correct, state your findings and explain them together with your hypothesis. After that is conclusion. That's the basic structure if you are using quantitative research and analysis. It is slightly different if one is using pure qualitative analysis. Keep in mind that thesis is all about explaining your thesis proposal, and arriving at a conclusion based on findings.",
