  "text": "Hello,\n\nI graduated with a degree in Political Science in 2019, and have fortunately been employed since. I am at a point in my career where  I am getting great experience in my work, but I want to take it to the next level. I have been wrestling with going to grad school for a few years but I have decided it is a potential good next step for me. However, I really cannot fathom the idea of going to school full time and not working. I have also found programs I like, but they are in unaffordable cities (SIPA-NY, Price, LA, Luskin, LA) \n\nI have been in the DC area for years at this point, which is a good city to be in for people with a Poli Sci degree. However, I am dying to move out of this area and move to a new city which I have also decided is a good next step for me. BUT, none of the programs I like are in that city. I am currently struggling on whether I should just do an online program so I can live my life and move to where I want to, or should I suck it up and move to another city for school. An online program doesn't sit right with me entirely because I feel like I may be missing out on some stuff, but it definitely would be the easier route with working/flexibility. Any insight is appreciated.",

      "text": "DC is indeed a great place to do policy-related work (if that's what you're into). I am in a social science PhD and did end up finding work outside of the city where I did my degree, and it wasn't a HUGE deal, but took some effort to network. Three thoughts:  \n\n\n1- Are the programs in the city of your choice really horrible? I ask because in the city where I did my Master's and then the city where I did my PhD, it would have been really easy to stay after my degree. We get tons of emails from local companies and orgs hiring for part time during degree then full-time after. You get so many local networking opportunities, and make local contacts. You may do best getting a degree in the place you want to live.   \n2- Online programs, especially in policy/social sci, are not as well seen as in-person programs. I think I would suggest skipping the degree in that case and trying to climb the ladder via work experience. (also - do you need a grad degree to advance? very possible, I personally did, but good to check this)  \n3- Could you stay in DC a bit longer and attend one of the amazing grad programs while you work for a couple years? You can potentially get a lot of mileage (degree name and work experience) out of this option.",

          "text": "Honestly if I hadn't grown up in the DC area *and* went to college in DC, I would stay. At this point though, I think it's best for me to move for personal growth. I don't think I'll never go back to DC, but I need to just go away for a little bit lol.\n\nHouston, which is where I  want to move to, does not really have a lot of MPP/MPA programs available from what I have seen. It seems that they are mostly focused on science, medicine, stuff like that. My job is remote, so this is fine with me. I looked at Rice, they have a Global Affairs Masters, which is fine but I'm not sure if I want Global policy to be my focus. \n\nThat is one of my gripes about the online programs, they aren't well seen and potentially I won't be able to network like I could at a brick-and-mortar. However, one of the programs I looked at is American University's online MPAP which seems well respected from what I see. Do you know anything about it or know anyone who did the program in DC? \n\nI am also feeling pressure to apply because I don't want to wait until I'm super removed from school and then go back, even though I know a lot of people go to grad school years after graduating and are able to. Also, every program has waived the GRE for admission due to COVID, and I want to take advantage of that lol. At this point, I don't necessarily need a grad degree to advance right now, but I don't want to be counted out of potential opportunities because I don't have one. I also loved school, and I miss being in an academic environment.",
