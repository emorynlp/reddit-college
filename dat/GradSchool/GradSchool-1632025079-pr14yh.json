  "text": "I'm studying abroad for an MA at the moment, and I thought that academia was what I always wanted to do. I already have a masters in my home country, which was fully funded, as is my current MA, but the state of academia has made me so depressed about my prospects. I used to work at a university in my home country before I came to study abroad, and whilst I didn't like my department that much, I realised that I would be happiest working in a role in study abroad at a university, or maybe admissions or accommodation, or even just administration more generally. I love helping students but not necessarily through teaching, and I enjoy working with academics professionally.\n\nThe more I think about this, the more I regret enrolling in an MA overseas because it's starting to feel like a waste of time. I'm going to contact the study abroad office to see if I can work or volunteer there to get experience.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Am I now too overqualified for university administration jobs? Is it okay to regret my decision after just a few months?",

                      "text": "Hi there! I actually did something similar where I mastered out of my PhD because I realized the job I wanted did not require a PhD (I still have a MS from the experience).\n\nHow much longer/how much debt are you in for your master\u2019s? I actually think a MA would be helpful for university admin work. Sometimes it matters less what the masters is actually in, and more so that it just shows that you\u2019re capable of EVEN MORE rigor that occurs beyond an undergraduate degree, which you can negotiate into a better position or more interesting projects once you\u2019re in the position. So, if you\u2019re close to finishing your masters I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too bad/might even be good to have a masters for these positions (DEFINITELY not a PhD).",

I\u2019ve had to learn quite a few new systems for my current position, but I was able to explain during my interview that, as a neuroscience grad student, I had to also learn complex systems quickly in order to progress in research. \n\nAnd, the systems you would need to learn for these positions are typically very user friendly (Outlook, Raisers Edge or Salesforce, etc) because basically anyone with some computer literacy should be able to use them.",
