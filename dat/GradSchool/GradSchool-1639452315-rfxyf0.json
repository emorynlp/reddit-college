  "text": "Hello all,\nI was admitted to the Master of Arts in Clinical Psychology with an Emphasis in Marriage and Family Therapy program at the Pepperdine University Graduate School of Education and Psychology (GSEP).\n\nI was hoping to get insight into the program and the degree itself. Is it worth it? Does it set you up for success within the clinical/counseling field? It\u2019s very expensive despite being online. About 100k. Any thoughts  appreciated.",

      "text": "Online + 100k = great money-maker for the university and a mountain of debt for you\n\nUnless there is a clear and proven path to a high-paying career afterwards, this program sounds fairly silly. This is the sort of debt taken out for top MBAs. But the idea is that most of those graduates easily walk into high-paying careers afterwards. I doubt that's the case in clinical psyc.",

      "text": "Hold on... $100k??  That's far too expensive for a graduate degree in psychology, in my opinion. You can get a quality master's degree elsewhere and save money. You want to be careful starting programs and not having a direct connect to a job afterwards. Are you going to be making close to $100k soon after graduation? Imagine all that debt.",

          "text": "Other lesser \u201cprestigious\u201d schools are less. Ranging in tuition from 20-100k for 2-3 year programs. This program sets you up for licensure as an MFT , LMFT and LPCC. Starting salaries depend where you practice and what kind of practice you\u2019re in. Can be between 50-100k per year. I\u2019m very much so interested in psychology as a career. I have bachelors in Neuro and psych. I don\u2019t like the lifestyle of phds of mds. I hear what you\u2019re saying- I feel the same way. I just don\u2019t know what to do I suppose.",
