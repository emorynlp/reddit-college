  "text": "Hi all i graduated about 3 years ago with a bachelor's in environmental science. I took a couple agronomy classes and have been infatuated with soils ever since. Unfortunately i screwed myself over by not doing any internships and haven't had any job experience in my field. I am much more interested in agronomy and i am conflicted about going back to school. Should i finish out a second bachelors and then master's or would it be in my best interest to save time and money by doing a master's in agronomy all together? I am definitely leaning towards a master's.... Can I do that without having my undergrad in the same subject?",

      "text": "Hey, fellow environmental scientist! The way I see it, if academia/working high up in the industry is your aim, then a bachelor\u2019s is really just an introduction to your subject, and a master\u2019s allows for further specialisation in a topic that interests you. For instance, I did my bachelor\u2019s, followed by a master\u2019s in the same subject, and now I\u2019m just finishing up a doctorate in air pollution. One person in my master\u2019s cohort spent her career in psychology and wanted a switch later in life. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have anything to worry about going straight for a master\u2019s, but would you really want to spend another 3/4 years in an undergraduate programme?",
