  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm about to graduate in a Canadian university(not any of the top schools) for computer engineering and it's really difficult to find hardware jobs in Canada(or the US) if you did not graduate from the top schools or have any prior experience. \n\nI would like to apply to jobs in the US for companies and I think doing a masters in the US would help me achieve that. What US schools should I look for?, so I look more employable to companies such as Intel, Nvidia, or any big tech company\n\nAny advice is welcome as well!",
