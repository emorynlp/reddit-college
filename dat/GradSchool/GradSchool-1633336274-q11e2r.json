It\u2019s the beginning of another academic year so there\u2019ll be a million and one things to solve.\n\nMaybe try speaking to your graduate office or administrators at the beginning of the week if you haven\u2019t already. I\u2019d leave escalating it until you\u2019re told otherwise, or your academic output is severely affected by not having a desk. It shouldn\u2019t come to that, however. In the meantime, see if your library has any graduate study areas where you can work. My first two semesters, I had to share a desk with a visiting post doc because there simply wasn\u2019t room for me until the department was expanded; it wasn\u2019t ideal but we made it work.\n\nEdit: double negative, oops!",
