  "text": "Hi folks. I just graduated from undergrad this year with a BS in Bioengineering, and preparing for a new job in pharmaceuticals. \n\nI do plan on going back to grad school, but I'm using this time to gain experience and also save up for tuition. What can I do to keep myself from falling out of the academia mindset? Any tips from others pursuing a bioscience based grad program who had a lot of time between their bachelor's and master's/PhD?",

      "text": "What kind of PhD program are you looking at? \n\nIf you\u2019re goal is med school, loans are probably faster than saving, but saving could offset some things like cost of living. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking at programs in research, there tends to be a lot of funding in the sciences. Apply for PhD programs over masters as there tend to be more funding for PhDs and nothing says you can\u2019t stop once you\u2019ve achieved your masters. \n\nMost of the folks I know with PhDs in the hard sciences didn\u2019t have to pay anything out of pocket and made about 24k/yr as a living stipend (this compared to about 12k/yr for PhD programs in my field in the humanities/social sciences). If you\u2019re really good, you can qualify for other grants that do even more to offset your cost of living.\n\nBasically, most non-medschool PhD programs in the sciences are very well funded and you should be able to work on campus (in research and teaching) for a heavy discount on classes and a living stipend.",

          "text": "Another reason I'm waiting is because of \"passion\". I haven't really found it yet. \n\nDuring my interview for the job I just got they asked me what I'm passionate about and I was honest in saying \"science\". They tried to get me to specify and for the sake of having a good interview I said microbiology was something I'm really interested in (which is true). But honest to God I love all science. I love reading articles about planetary science, computer science, cancer research, sequencing breakthroughs, robotics, microbes, viruses, physics etc etc. I read everything that crosses my feed from r/science. Like, it's all just *so cool*.\n\nThis past year I've been giving Astrobiology a look, as it relates somewhat to my background and also includes my childhood passion for space. Though there are not many programs for that. Thinking about getting a few books to read up on it first.",

              "text": "As a bioengineer, you probably have a background in chemistry and physics as well, am I right?\n\nYou may not have to stick to bio if you find another area that interests you. Obviously, it depends on the program and requirements. But I know a biostats PhD student (can\u2019t remember the actual name of their field) who transferred from the math PhD program having never taken biology but having an extensive math and statistics background that was essential to the bio research being done in this lab. \n\nIn addition, I know a couple of chemist PhD students who only minored in chemistry. I know a geology PhD student who works with soil involving microbiology and incorporating geography principles as well. \n\nBasically, keep exploring the stuff that interests you and know that if you discover something outside of your undergrad degree, it\u2019s probably still accessible if you have the references, grades and GRE scores. \n\nMy best advice is to start looking more deeply into the scientific articles and papers that you\u2019re drawn to. Use these to discover programs, possible advisors and labs that you\u2019d be interested in working in. \n\nIn some programs you apply broadly for acceptance in say, \u201cchemistry\u201d and spend your first year rotating through a couple of different labs to find a good fit for your research and advisor. Once you narrow it down to schools you might want to go to, you can contact their departments to get more info about the process of finding a lab, funding, acceptance rates, etc.\n\nIf you love science, you\u2019ll probably be happy doing most things, but in a PhD program, you\u2019re going to be getting very in depth in one area for 5-7 years and if you stay in academia, way beyond that.\n\nThis poses another good question. Do you see yourself staying in academia, or is this PhD something you\u2019d like to use to land a (hopefully) high-paying private sector job? This could help you distinguish what sort of programs to apply to. \n\nOne thing my friend in neuroscience said to me as she was finishing her program was:\n\n \u201cI should have gone to \u2018x\u2019 for grad school because their program was more aligned with my focus, but I didn\u2019t know what that was when I applied. It\u2019s funny, you only see the program you should have done after you\u2019re finished with your PhD.\u201d\n\nBasically, don\u2019t sweat too much over picking the right program, just find a program because no matter what, you\u2019ll probably be looking at greener grass on the other side somewhere else. There will always be another program as cool or cooler than yours and that\u2019s okay. *AND there are always post-docs for this.*\n\nEdit: for clarity and grammar.",

I didn't ask any questions or do as much research as I should have for my undergrad and I want to make sure I don't make the same mistake again.\n\nGoing to do some more reading.\n\nThanks for your time! I really appreciate it :)",
