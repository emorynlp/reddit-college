  "text": "Just a shout out to humanities grad students! As weird as it sounds, this quarantine period has given me a newfound appreciation for the sheer amount of reading humanities students do for their research. I\u2019m a wet bench stem grad student and because of the lock downs, I can\u2019t go into lab and have just been exclusively reading papers. I\u2019m starting to get stir crazy not being able to hold a pipette and also realizing how terrible my reading stamina is. My bf is a humanities grad student and has already read a book and a half today like it\u2019s nothing, and from what I understand, this is fairly standard for the humanities. It\u2019s honestly commendable, you guys are awesome :)",

You're not spending too much time thinking about what's going on because it's all pretty easy to digest and understand. Those I can read pretty easily, 250 pages would probably be a couple hours without skimming. \n\nDenser novels, where the prose is more complicated or the ideas are more complex take more effort. But, when you read enough of the same kind of thing (same genre, same author, same general style) you get pretty good at figuring out what's important. So you can skim superfluous description of what someone or something looks like, and skim dialogue that doesn't appear to be important, while carefully reading sections that are important that contain foreshadowing or the action of the story. I wouldn't say it's skimming 95% for myself, but maybe for some. \n\nThere are also novels that have huge swaths of unnecessary description that can be skipped over without missing anything.",

In graduate programs, the goal of reading a book is often to evaluate its argumentation or synthesis of theory, which can be done by skimming.

There were two big strategies though: one was dividing my poles and piles and piles of reading into categories, and the other was thinking about exam prep. It was unlikely that my examiners would ask which character in the medieval play I was reading was the one to get another character drunk, but I knew they\u2019d want to know big themes and how that play fit into a pattern with the other books I was reading. I wasn\u2019t looking to memorize info, but I needed a sense of the work and maybe to hold onto a scene or recurring image I could whip out to give myself details to draw on while answering. \n\nIt also helps to write out the list. When it came time to review, seeing the titles and authors went a long way to reminding me what I had read. Still, 5 years later, I look at the lists and can tell you a lot about each work (albeit less than I could back then). \n\nIt certainly helps that those books were part of the fabric of my field and many directly relate to my research and teaching. One (out of six) of my lists was just all of Shakespeare\u2019s works and some fundamental criticism, and I\u2019m a Shakespeare. It\u2019s kind of like boot camp for packing on academic muscle.",
