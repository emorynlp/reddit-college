  "text": "Hi all (mods, I hope you understand how this is a relevant posting on this subreddit),\n\nI\u2019m leaving this here because it\u2019s something that affects all grad students to some extent. Currently, UCSC graduate students are enduring precarious conditions as we are living in one of the roughest housing economies in the nation- the majority of us are forced to pay 50% or more of our TA incomes towards rent alone (likely more if living in campus graduate student housing). We are currently on an unsanctioned WILDCAT GRADING STRIKE in order obtain a necessary Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). We need this COLA in order to get out from underneath the rent burden so many of us are facing. \n\nWe need support and solidarity  from anywhere and everywhere we can get it! Please visit https://payusmoreucsc.com  or @payusmoreucsc on Instagram for more information on our COLA campaign!!\n\nEDIT: FEEL FREE TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT IN THE COMMENT SECTION!!!",

The rest of you need to stop fucking whining.\n\nTHE UNDERGRADS ARE IN IT WITH US TOO, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SOLIDARITY WITH THEM??",

              "text": "Correct, the context has changed. Undergrads are unable to obtain the education that they pay for unless they want to walk miles (including disabled folks, Douchebags)and 5% of graduate students are unwilling and 95% are unable to do the work that they are/were getting paid for.  I\u2019m annoyed, the undergrads are annoyed, and the cola subreddit, despite their claims of transparency, will delete things or ban you at their leisure if it is anti cola.\n\nI just feel sorry for the undergrads. I want them to get the education that they are fucking paying for\n\n*and no, Paying 50% of your rent should be considered a gift since it\u2019s part of your package that you signed up for when you were accepted into our program. Obviously there was no statement of the local rent but we were all capable of googling it or searching reddit.  We get a good deal already, though it could be better.  The housing supplement of 2500 they offered was a great start though and the cola folks spat at it.\n\nOur benefits are great, medical, dental and vision, and a slew of other helpful programs like food pantries that I have used too but you don\u2019t hear me crying about it.\n\nCould the situation be improved?  Yes.  Were the cola organizers tactful(or realistic)?  NO",

I don't know if it's a failure of imagination or whatever, but it's a common occurrence on a host of issues.  You're simply not capable of reasoning past your own narrow life. Massive mental weakness, btw.\n\nI'm a tenured prof now but I went through grad school in a really expensive part of the country (most good schools are not in the midwest save the Chicago/Milwaukee region).  The problems facing the UCSC grads are the same facing those in the Northeast -- incredibly expensive housing, high student fees not covered under tuition, and the general expenses of life (and heaven help if you if you come in to school with any other sort of debt). The stipend is simply not enough to sustain people if everything goes right, let alone if life circumstances go south in any way.",

                          "text": "I already checked your posting history out.  You're a non-traditional student getting a BS degree on the GI Bill.  You've literally just been accepted into a PhD program. Right now, your knowledge of graduate school is theoretical/second-hand. \n\nI am telling you as someone with two MA's, a PhD, AND \"real-world\" experience before going in -- it's way, WAY harder than you think it is.  I'm not even talking about the degrees themselves. Success and failure in grad school is a matter of skill, intelligence, and hard work... but -- and this is key -- it's also primarily a matter of LUCK.  I made it  through because I was smart, hard-working but also incredibly fortunate. \n\nBeing poor -- as you know -- means you're always one disaster away from catastrophe. However, being a poor grad student means you're one disaster away from a life-wrecking catastrophe.  You're literally gambling nearly a decade of current earning potential on future earning potential.  One misstep and you've basically put yourself in an irrecoverable hole.\n\nNow having said that, these institutions -- supposedly run by enlightened folk -- instead keep their grad students hovering right AT this tipping point.  Can some make it through? Sure, but you've reduced their margin of success radically  (even if you're smart, hard-working, and skilled).  That's why it makes sense to fight for what theyre fighting for.",

Thankfully the department subsidizes us a little bit so we're paid more like a shift manager, but the state approved stipend is barely above minimum wage if you work 40 hours which is less than anybody actually works. Never mind that rent+utilities would be more than 50% of that salary (and significantly more than that at the other public school which is in a big city). Obviously the school would argue that you're a student, not a worker (even though we're literally considered faculty by the university) and that the payment is for less than half of 40 hours a week.\n\nNot to mention that the higher ups decided that we should really screw over all the students tax wise with uneven payments. It does get refunded ultimately, but christ, we literally pay an extra ~$300 in taxes throughout the year purely so that the University's balance sheet looks slightly less bad in summer when revenue is down. Never mind that there are people who literally teach during the months where we're not paid.\n\nI also think a big part of why private schools treat students better is that they're just flat out smaller. Don't get me wrong, the state fucks us over too, but based off of the contents of our mandatory TA training class, the University leadership clearly has no god damn idea what TAing a chemistry lab actually involves. We have incredibly helpful exercises like writing a lesson plan even though no graduate student in the entire department has any curriculum control whatsoever, rubric making even though no graduate student in the department makes assignments, test design even though no graduate student in the department makes tests, and techniques for keeping a classes attention during long lectures even though no lab lecture is longer than ten minutes. They figured out that a chemistry lab has chemicals in it, though they vastly overestimated how dangerous they are and underestimated what level of engineering controls the teaching labs have, but literally everything else in that semester long course just straight up does not apply to a chemistry TA position.  I picked on the center of instruction here, but this kind of stuff happens all the time. Like the time they had to find funding for a second chemistry building because nobody on the planning committee realized that chemistry research oftentimes involves class IV lasers and cannot be legally done in an open concept lab which the building design exclusively has.",

What about the future of union representation for the UCSC graduate students? \n\nFrom the article I\u2019ve read it seems that only humanities students are striking. Are any students from other disciplines also involved in this strike? \n\nGoing off of my previous question, do stipends between departments and disciplines vary greatly? For example humanities vs STEM?\n\nThe students are demanding a \u201ccost of living\u201d increase of $1400 per month. What were the metrics used to calculate this figure?\n\nFinally, do graduate students at UCSC have health insurance? Does this include dental? Does the insurance cover the entire 12 months or just the length of the stipend?",

This goes hand in hand with the beginning of the end of powerful unions, deregulation of pretty much every sector: financial/environmental/media+cable/etc, and a bunch of other cultural-economic decisions (Nixon jumping off the gold standard, opening up relations with China, yada yada yada)",

So a larger chunk of their income goes to rent, but of what remains, they can save a lot more because they aren't paying health deductibles and all that crap.\n\nPeople in the US general make higher salaries, but have to pay a lot more for things that are cheap or free in Europe; so 50% only to rent is very high in a lot of places in the US outside of the major cities.",
