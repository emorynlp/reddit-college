  "text": "I received a reply from a professor saying that I should mention his/her name as a potential supervisor.  First question, what's the best way to thank him/her? Just thank you is okay or should I write a line? Please recommend. The second question, I have some interests in area B too and I would like to contact some professors of the same dept. with whom I share my interests. So is that okay?",

Generally applications are reviewed by a range of faculty, and the more you've made personal contact with/like you the better.",

I didn\u2019t update when I put in my application, personally, but this depends on how much you talk to them etc. basically just remember professors are just normal people and treat them that way (but respectful).\n\nI always begin emails Hi ____ personally but again this is subjective. I always address a professor for the first time as Dr. _____ and then moving forward address them however they sign their email. I say this because in 99% of my contacts they sign off with their first name and I address them as such moving forward.",

Overall I would suggest not overthinking it, whatever you write in your email the professor will probably glance at it, delete it and never think twice about it.
