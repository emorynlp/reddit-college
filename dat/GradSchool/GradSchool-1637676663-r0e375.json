  "text": "So my wife is getting her PhD in immunology and I\u2019m so proud of her. She does a lot of poster presentations at conferences and carries her poster around in a cardboard shipping tube. \n\nLooking for suggestions for a really nice poster tube/protective carrier, so she can roll up to her conferences in style (and protect her work when traveling). All the ones I\u2019ve found online are shitty plastic ones with bad reviews. \n\nPlease post links to any products that you love! Thank you Reddit!\n\nPs. I\u2019m just a humble engineer with a BS and after seeing my wife struggle through grad school, I\u2019m so impressed with y\u2019all",
