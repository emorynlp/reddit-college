  "title:": "Friendly reminder to take care of yourself today",
  "text": "I just spent the last few days visiting with my close family that I haven\u2019t seen in over two years. It felt amazing to be surrounded by non-academics, and talk minimally about science (which almost entirely rules my life nowadays.) We spent most of the weekend hiking and sightseeing, which was really fun. \n\nWhen they left, I just kind of bawled my eyes out because I felt... like... fulfilled? (Or generally, that happy, warm & fuzzy feeling you get from spending time with good people, doing things you enjoy.) \n\nAfter feeling drained for the past 11 months of 2020, I actually feel recharged. \n\nSo, in case you needed to be reminded today: take time for yourself now and then, my people. Your research is worth getting lost in, but not losing yourself over (or your health).",

It\u2019s to encourage our fellow grad students to take care of themselves...  both physical and mental health. \n\nI know holidays often mean more research (and I\u2019m usually pretty amped for the extra lab time), but remember to put yourself first. Your research, papers, grants will be better products and feel less of a burden. Please take care of yourself. Take it from someone who destroyed their health for years working full time/living in poverty just to get to a PhD: your health is everything.",

It was one of the most productive day i ever had.\n\nIt's easy to feel guilty about using  free time to relax instead of working but we need it. If anything, taking breaks here and there improves the quality of your work (at least, in my case it does).",
