  "text": "Guys, I've had it. It has been over 4 years in my program (PhD in Mech Eng) and I am about to contact my advisor and tell him I quit. I've been shut down, told that my ideas are stupid, and I'm barely making it through. I've been a TA since the beginning and they can't understand why I am taking so long to graduate. My parents are also going after me about taking too long in school. I'm just about to leave and hopefully find a job asap. I know I've wasted Soo much time and money but I can't stay here right now. Bad bad thoughts have crossed my mind and it's not okay.",

When getting a PhD, and luck is not on your side, and when you apply for a research scientist position immediately after graduation, you are going to be stuck in post doc hellish nightmare  making $35-40k a year and being treated like a glorified lab tech. If you still can't find a research scientist position or can't get hired on as a tenured track professor you are stuck being an underpaid post doc until you are no longer employable. \n\nYou are doing the right thing quitting.

I've been through a PhD and there were many times that i wanted to quit, the first week i was there i was so homesick i cried in my crappy small apartment remembering my family i had left just a few days before. I wanted to quit when my results kept coming back negative and my PI and co-supervisors sometimes responded in ways that were more critical than helpful. I wanted to quit when my dad got sick, and i wanted to quit when it felt like no-body gave a shit about my project except for me. But i didn't. That doesnt make me any different from someone who quit, and it doesnt make me any stronger of a person, this is just something i chose to do because of what finishing would mean to me. Screw everybody else, do whatever you want to do deep down.
