Which of those descriptors do you think is inaccurate? If somebody started a conversation with you the way you started a conversation with OP, I wonder what you'd call it.\n\n> they just sound so hostile to the idea of doing one small kind gesture for others.\n\nThey're frustrated, and everybody else in this thread understands why. Even if you don't understand, you could at least try to read the room to recognize that maybe you're missing something. Sort of like how drivers (hopefully) slow down when they see signs that say \"Watch for playing children\" before they see any children.\n\n> I just thought their attitude towards their committee members and a potentially gracious gesture was very sour.\n\n\"Hey, you (the cash-strapped grad student) are expected to bring us (the tenured professors) snacks for when we listen to your thesis defense (our jobs)\" is not a gracious gesture. It's a gross instance of entitlement mentality and abuse of power. You could've sympathized with OP, or you could've been critical toward the greedy committee. Instead, your reaction was to make personal attacks toward OP for expressing frustration about it in a place that supposed to be safe for grad students to express frustration.\n\nI don't have anything else to say here. I wanted to stick up for OP and object to your post, and I've done that. I hope you stop trying to defend yourself on this and start taking a hard look at why you thought and wrote what you did. I also hope you decide to apologize to OP. But you're the captain of your vessel, and I'm just some guy on the internet. Even if you don't take my feedback to heart, good luck with your studies.",
