  "text": "Pretty much just the title. I failed my department's qualifying exams and I'll be finished in the PhD program in May. I'll be obtaining an MA from the program which is nice, but I had an MS going into the PhD program. I feel like listing both on a resume/CV without any explanation would come across as weird, but I'm not exactly sure how to phrase it. Anyone here have any experience/knowledge regarding a good way to handle this?  For what it's worth, I'm applying to non-academic research positions that typically do consider applicants with masters degrees, but (obviously) prefer those with doctorate degrees. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can offer.",

I have it on good authority that it was rigged against her by sexist faculty (2 of the 5 faculty members have later apologized and verbally admitted wrongdoing).  Shit happens - no choice but to move on.\n\nShe started a business, essentially immediately, which had 6 figures of revenue in the first year, and employed her major adviser for a bit.  She says \"I dropped out to start my first business\" (she has now had 3).  While it isn't *precisely* true, it is remarkably close to true, and, here in America, there is never any shame in starting businesses (especially reasonably successful ones).\n\nSo, something like \"after X years and my MS, I'm ready for a new direction\" or \"I am ready to apply what I've learned\" answers the mail pretty truthfully.  Note that most companies, fundamentally, *do not care* about your grades, GPA, best paper awards or whatever.  The question for them is frequently basically \"I have a problem, can I pay this person to make it go away?\"",

I wouldn\u2019t bother with noting that you were in a PhD program on your CV.\n\nEmployers may or may not pick up on the fact that you left a PhD program (some programs only offer terminal MAs to students who leave the program \u2014 not sure if that applies to you). Regardless they may ask why you have a second graduate degree, and I would be as honest as possible while withholding the qualifying exam stuff. Just say that you entered the PhD program and realized that was not the path you wanted to take. IMO, that\u2019s a valid answer. You don\u2019t really know what PhD level research is like until you actually start doing it, and sometimes, it\u2019s not what you want. \n\nBe careful who you list as references though. I\u2019m not sure if departments even allow profs to disclose whether students passed certain exams to employers, but you never know. If you ask someone from your former department to be a reference, make sure that they\u2019re on your side when it comes to finding a job. They won\u2019t disclose unflattering stuff like that if they want to help you. \n\nGood luck.",

It's basically three 4 hour exams (Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Econometrics) where they choose topics from each field (seemingly at random) and require the students to get \"around 90% correct\" - the grading guidelines are not explicitly stated - on each of the three exams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the risk of sounding bitter that I failed, I just feel this is a horrible measure of testing PhD candidacy because it ignores all research capabilities for the sake of a single set of examinations, some of which are not field relevant to what someone is pursuing.  My university historically has a \\~35% pass rate and, anecdotally based on my cohort, passed people that will definitely struggle with research while failing others that have produced or would produce great research.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver the past few years, more upper tier schools have moved away from this type of qualifying exam for the reason I mentioned. So I do think this is somewhat explainable to recruiters, however I am aware that the stance I've taken does seem somewhat \\*woe is me\\* and bitter so I'd like to minimize the focus on it as much as possible.",

I've been PI on a federally-funded research study and Co-I on a couple others.\n\nUs \"recovered economists\" are pretty common in the policy institute, think tank, non-university academic world.

Show excitement to get started doing real world work, not just research level stuff, and say it wasn\u2019t for you right now- you always thought you\u2019d be doing this or that, but in the end the work that excites you is applied, and in the business world where you can make the most difference to a company producing xyz etc.",

I think any employer worth working for is going to understand someone doing what they feel is best for them.",
