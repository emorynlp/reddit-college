  "title:": "Should I knowingly neglect to take a class that is required for my master's degree, if I don't need the degree?",
  "text": "This is a pretty niche problem, but I don't know who to ask this to in real life. Basically, I'm in a master's program right now, but I already have a bachelor's from a great school. I'm only in this program because it's fully funded, so I get to take classes to boost my GPA, and get more research experience, before applying to PhD programs.\n\nThere's one course that is required for the master's degree, that is just absolutely unreasonable. I would've gotten a 4.0 overall this semester, except for this class, in which I got a B due to a truly incompetent professor. Just as a few examples, he canceled class almost every week this semester, usually a few minutes before class was supposed to start; he made assignments required that weren't mentioned on the syllabus; and he graded assignments with absolutely no feedback and all extremely late so we couldn't improve on future assignments. It's only 0.5 credits, so it's really irritating to me that I will have to explain to PhD ad coms why I can't get an A in a small course. The worst part, and my problem, is that the program requires me to take this course every semester until I graduate.\n\nLike I said, I don't really need the degree portion, since I'm taking rigorous courses and ad coms will care more about that than if I have the diploma. So, I have no intention of re-enrolling in a class that I learn nothing from and will bring down my GPA. (It's also a ridiculous amount of work for 0.5 credits.) But is there any way this could backfire on me, or otherwise be something I should think twice about? It shouldn't affect my funding, since my funding is dependent on my research and being a full-time student, not what particular classes I take. I don't have to worry about asking the professor for a letter of recommendation, and he won't be sitting on my thesis committee. He's literally just some professor with a huge ego on a power trip. Is there anything I might not have thought of? (I understand that this is a minor issue, and not having a 4.0 isn't the end of the world. However, I did pretty poorly in undergrad and boosting my GPA is really important to me because of that. I really need to squeeze every grade point I can out of this program.)",

      "text": "Read your student handbook carefully - is \"good standing\" just related to keeping a high GPA, or is it also related to things like completing required classes and generally fulfilling the requirements of the program? In other words, could the program kick you out if you refuse to meet program requirements?\n\nAlso, I'm a Director of Graduate Studies, and I would make sure you're very certain that you can get into the PhD programs you want while also essentially deliberately refusing to meet the basic expectations of your MS program. I'm in a different field than you, but it would be a red flag that we would be discussing in the admissions committee in my program. I'm not saying you're wrong, but it would be good to get the opinions of a few faculty at the schools you're applying to just to be sure.",

Would I be able to explain it by demonstrating the grade I got and how it wasn't representative of the work I put into the course? I just have no idea what else to do about this one class. Also, would PhD ad coms even know about it being a requirement? It would just look like one random course I took.",

              "text": "My assumption would be that there would be something about you planning on not finishing your MS in your application package - either in your personal statement or in one of your letters of rec. Not finishing would be a negative when your application is reviewed - we look at things like evidence of grit and tenacity, personal responsibility, and academic success when we rank applications. Many programs (in my field at least) are moving in the direction of holistic application review instead of numerical ranking with GPA and GRE, so evidence of those types of professional skills and maturity matters. We wouldn't be able to see that this class was a requirement (assuming it wasn't mentioned by any of your letter writers) so it would more be the lack of finishing your MS that would be the issue.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying it would necessarily sink your application to not take this class / not finish your MS, just that it would be a point of discussion at the table. One of the things we'd look for is an explanation from you in your Statement that explains the situation *without* putting the blame on this professor (you will have professors / supervisors / bosses throughout your whole career who have unrealistic expectations... I'm not saying that's okay, just that we would want to see you also take responsibility for not meeting the expectations that the majority of your cohort met). It might also help to enlist a trusted prof to discuss the situation in a letter of rec, explaining how and why you could not meet those expectations, including why it should not reflect badly on your future potential as a PhD student.\n\n(And again - I'm saying all of this with the assumption that not taking a required class will not cause you to lose your spot in your program. You would likely be removed from my program; refusing to take a required class means you cannot graduate, so at best you could continue to take courses as a non-degree seeking student, which means you wouldn't be eligible for thesis credits or to continue MS research, and you'd lose your assistantship support.)",

                  "text": "A big YES to not blaming the professor and just sucking it up. Not just for your phd, but in any situation where you need to leave a good impression.\nYou could complain \"behind the scenes\", say if you get accepted and become friendly with your supervisor, then it's ok to casually mention that \"omg you know that one B? That class was really a mess.\" But you need to let your own grit and determination shine through. The rest of your work would speak for itself. If asked, you could say something diplomatic where it shines through that \"it's not me, it's him\" without saying it directly.\nDifferent, but similar situation : I once quit a job because my manager was a bully and an absolute nutcase. In an interview for a similar position elsewhere, the lady interviewing asked me why I'd left. I said something along the lines of \"the work climate and corporate culture wasn't really aligned with my values\". At the end of the interview, when I was offered the job, she said \"So, was it XXX who made your life hell?\" Turned out she knew her. Of course she did. It was a small world. But at least I showed that I knew what a professional attitude is, and that I didn't point fingers.\n\nAlso, like somebody else said here, if the course is way off the description etc, I'd file a complaint to the faculty. At the university where I work, they take such things very seriously. The faculty director (head of admin) is the right person to contact. If more of you go together and file a complain, especially if many of you otherwise have excellent grades, they would likely take a complaint seriously.",

      "text": "So, the one of the points I was going to make was already covered by other comments, and I agree with the other commenters about sticking through the class and the degree, but one other thing that stood out to me:\n\n> he made assignments required that weren't mentioned on the syllabus\n\nWhat sort of changes to assignments happened? Because if it changed the grading scheme (for example, adding a project or test that didn't exist and redistributing how grades are calculated), you may have a case to take this do the department or university administration. Adding an extra homework assignment when the grade for that category is \"homework average\" is usually fine, even if there's a schedule in the syllabus that outlines due dates. But if the changes affected the stated grading policies in the syllabus, at many universities that's something you can push back against. Retroactively fighting it would be hard, but fighting such things in subsequent semesters is *absolutely* worth looking into.",
