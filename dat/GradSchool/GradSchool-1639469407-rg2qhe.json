  "text": "Hello everyone , I am applying for masters programs in CS , due to my low gpa (2.9/4) I'm looking for a safe school to apply to where I'll have a good chance of getting acceptance. I have already selected some good ranking universities based on my  faculty and course interests . But due to low gpa, I'm afraid I might not be able to get into them, so I'm looking to apply to atleast one program in the CSU system.\n\n\n\nMy primary preferences are for selecting a university are :- \n\n[ 1 ] Quality of coursework offered ( also research opportunities if available but I've heard that CSUs are not that good for research). For context , my main area of interest is Computer vision , machine learning and deep learning.  I do understand that with such a low gpa, you don't get to be very selective about anything , but I still want to get good mix of courses related to my interests. \n\n[2] Job opportunities after graduating from the Uni. This is important for me as I'll be taking a hefty loan to fund my education , so want to be able to clear it up as soon as I can.\n\n[ 3] Lower Cost of living in the city where the university is located( for the same reason as stated above)\n\n\nAfter a bit googling I found out that Cal Poly state is considered a good school among the CSUs , but I'm worried about it's far away location and therefore job/internship opportunities. For this reason I am looking into CSU Fullerton and CSU long beach , but I'm not sure how do their coursework and faculties compare to Cal Poly. Also being in LA area, there will possibly be a high cost of living if choose long beach or Fullerton. \n\n But I understand that all these assumptions and assessments of mine may be completely incorrect, as a lot of information on the internet can be worng. Therefore I request you all to give your opinions and recommendations on this. \n\n\nTLDR  :-. I'm looking for a good university for Masters in CS in the  Cal State University system. Looking forward to your recommendations or comments about any of them.",
