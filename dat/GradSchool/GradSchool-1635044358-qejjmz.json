  "text": "Okay so my undergrad prof happened to do post doc studies with the professor who is doing my dream research. And I do not know what I'm gonna say or do. My main questions are what do professors/researcher look for in potential PhD students. Can I ask if he thinks I have a chance of getting in or is that weird I've read most of his research, well that isn't behind a paywall and have questions from that, but idk I really wanna impress him. Like I don't think he'll give mea research position then and there but at least it might help my chances of getting in. Any advice is very appreciated!",

      "text": "First, no researcher will think it's weird that you've read their research. That's actually a good thing in prospective students because it shows genuine interest. Being able to explain your interests and how you see them fitting with their research is a big plus.\n\nSecond, establish some goals for yourself before the meeting. I recommend starting with explicitly describing what you want from working with this researcher. Do you want research experience? Teaching experience? Do you have a bunch of burning questions about a particular topic? Then use the meeting to learn about how this researcher can help you meet those goals. Are they looking for a research tech or a teaching aid? How interested are they in mentoring, and what kind of mentoring do they engage with currently? What kinds of jobs have their previous students gotten? Are they looking for someone to come in and work on their research, or would you have the freedom to design and pursue your own project?",

      "text": "I always recommend as an incoming PhD student is to have an idea of a project you want to do. Have it mostly fleshed out but be flexible, things change and so you want to come off as amenable.\n\nLetting them know you've read their work is great! They will probably ask you what you thought about it. So be sure to have insight into their work.\n\nAnother tip, it isn't embarrassing or unprofessional to say you are a little nervous. In reality, it often breaks the ice and once you get that off your shoulders, you don't have to spend brainpower trying to hide your nervousness.\n\n**What do PIs look for?** Flexibility, determination, interest in the research, resiliency, work history, knowledge of the field and current research, willingness to learn.\n\n**Some things you should know beforehand:** What is your mentorship/mentee style? Do you prefer a hands on/off approach for your boss? What are your research strengths and weaknesses? What are your research interests? If you were going to plan and submit an outline for a research project (working with this PI) what would it be?\n\n**Things to ask the PI:** What is your mentorship style? Do you have funding for a PhD student? How does summer employment work? What projects do you currently have in the works? Do you have any research interests that you haven't been able to look into yet? Can I talk to some of your previous graduate students? What is the department culture?",
