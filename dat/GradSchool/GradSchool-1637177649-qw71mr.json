  "text": "Hello everyone! I'm a master's student currently in my first semester, I want to apply for my PhD in April 2022, and I was wondering if anyone had experience completing their thesis within 3 semesters? \n\nFor more context, I'll be finishing all of my course work (hopefully) next semester, and will just need to finish my thesis in the summer of 2022. Currently, I'm also starting my experiments.\n\nI know this is ambitious, but I'm going to try it anyway. Thoughts? Comments? Advice?",

      "text": "It really depends on your advisor and what they think is enough to merit a thesis. At my university we have a degree option that lets you do a 1 year MS, and the ability to do it in that time frame is really variable. Some people have stuff done well in advance because they\u2019ve been in the lab a long time, and others end up taking an extra semester (3 total) to get it all done. But to be brief, yes, 3 semesters is very possible.",
