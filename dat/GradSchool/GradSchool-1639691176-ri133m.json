  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to recruit for my research study (clinical neuroscience in the alcohol use disorder field) for a couple of months with the goal of having 40 participants by the end of 2022 (trying to graduate in June 2023). BUT THEY KEEP GHOSTING ME, either not showing up to appointments they confirmed the day before, showing up too late to keep the schedule with the med center / scanner, showing up under the influence (this is kind of just a casualty of doing substance use research but it\u2019s still rough). \n\nToday I had my first participant who passed the behavioral and medical screenings come in for their experimental session, only to blow a 0.178 on the breathalyzer, so we had to cancel the appointment since they have to be stone cold 0.000 sober to consent. And it. Just. Broke me. \n\nThis project is my baby, I\u2019ve been working on getting it up and running for the past two years, secured funding for it, etc. and I just DID NOT anticipate the hardest part being simply *getting participants in*. The last couple months of trying to recruit people with absolutely nothing to show for it has really shattered my mental health in a completely unexpected way. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to hate this study because the science part of it is so exciting\u2026 but I\u2019m starting to get there, and starting to question why I\u2019m even putting in so much effort if I can\u2019t get any participants. \n\nSo I guess, for anyone who works in human subjects research, I\u2019m asking for kind of twofold advice: \n1) general recruitment / retainment of participants\n2) how to stop taking it so hard when they don\u2019t show up \n\nAnd I guess if anyone knows people in the Los Angeles area who drink a lot, hmu lol \ud83d\ude43",

      "text": "The thing about human subjects research is that your participants are - humans. Humans who have things happen in their lives suddenly or make mistakes. The other piece of this is that your population probably doesn\u2019t know a lot about research so they don\u2019t/can\u2019t comprehend why showing up after a few drinks means they can\u2019t do the study or why showing up late is a problem. It is a part of their disorder. \n\nMy first piece of advice is to change your reminder strategy. Do 24 hours ahead AND 4 hours ahead. Call them that morning, remind them of their appointment, explain that to get through everything they need to do their best to be on time, and that it is important they not drink before the session. \n\nSecond, consider altering your recruitment to have more education about research and your study in particular. You want to make sure they understand what is going to happen that day so they can see why being late is a problem for them (they don\u2019t get paid). \n\nThird, when scheduling participants ask them when they are most likely to be sober or to not have anything to drink for Y hours. It might be in the morning. If you schedule for when they typically don\u2019t drink they are less likely to show up drunk. \n\nFourth, help with transportation if possible. I don\u2019t mean drive them to the study. Arrange for bus pass or uber rides. \n\nFifth, work with a community partner to build connections with this community. Someone they trust and respect who can help you identify the best possible candidates for your study because they are the most likely to show up. \n\nOk that is all my advice atm",

          "text": "Thank you so much for taking the time to write all this out - it's great advice and I really appreciate it.\n\nI've been trying to implement some of these points already (i.e. telling the participants in advance that if they have >0.000 breath alcohol we will not be able to complete the visit and they won't be compensated; offering bus fare / parking validation / uber reimbursement; offering a (albeit small) monetary bonus for arriving on time; scheduling visits in the morning - although today's visit was actually at 8:30 AM, so I think the participant must have just drank heavily late last night and it hadn't washed out of their system yet. TBH that's probably kind of on me, I didn't even think to tell them not to drink for the whole night before, I just said not to drink the day of the visit.)\n\nI really like the community partner idea and I would love to try that, but I don't have any idea where to start on that. How do you go about finding one? I've thought about offering a referral bonus to completers if they refer someone who also ends up completing the study, which might get at some of those benefits, but also obviously... requires the initial people completing the study in the first place.\n\nI also objectively know that recruitment kind of got fucked by starting in late october / early november right as we were heading into the holidays, which is notoriously a rough time, so I'm really hoping things start to turn around in January. It just feels bad currently.",

My institution has a human subjects core who helps with recruitment and they do community building. Maybe there are some people in your department who can help get that rolling. \n\nHonestly with covid still happening, holidays, and a difficult population, I would anticipate needing to recruit 3x the number you expect to complete the study. Research always takes 2-3 times longer than we think it will. \n\nBest of luck!",

A little trick I learned back in my real estate days - always use an interrogative rather than declarative when scheduling stuff. Make their response be an affirmation, not just an agreement.\n\nEg \"you: I'm confirming your appointment for tomorrow. Them:ok\" - that's no good\n\n\"You, are you still able to attend you appointment tomorrow? Them: yes\" - slightly better\n\nIt's no sure thing, but I think it helped. People are flakey.",

Or even just ask your department's administrative assistant who is able to send out mass emails to the department asking if people who have X, Y, and Z habits come to become a study participant?  Have a quick questionnaire (to figure out if they fit your target criteria) and if eligible then use them as a participant.\n\nAlso I know the grant is already funded but usually in these studies you also have a financial incentive (1 hour of your time == 20 dollars for you).  That's how they were able to make sure their participants were incentivized to come and be ready to participate.  Literally equals to like 6 drinks at the local bar (or 1 drink at a fancy cocktail bar).",
