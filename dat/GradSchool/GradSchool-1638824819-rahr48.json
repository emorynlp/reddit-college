  "text": "I just need to tell somebody who might empathise!\nI've got an oral examination tomorrow and I've lost my voice. It's driving me and my family mental. I also cough. My god.\nTo make matters worse, it's on zoom, so I'll have no other way of expressing myself than using my voice. No body language, and the eye contact is \"fake\".\n\nThis will be interesting. I can talk like the best of them. Other than that, I'm not particularly over prepared....\n\nI wonder if I should email my professor and give her a heads up, so she knows what to expect, or if that would be lame. \n\nWish me luck...!",

Make certain you have enlarged the font such that it would be readable for other people.",

But at least there is sound. However, now I'm sleep deprived lol.\nGood god! Put me out of this misery...!\nLast day of an endless term coming up!",

One of the good things about an oral, is that you can steer the talk away from your weak spots and over to the things you want to discuss. With a bit of verbal skill. But with a chat, the examinators would be able to look at it, and identify what you did... I feel like it's not quite the same as a talk. It would suddenly be a written examination.\nInteresting food for thought (i study language and communication, haha).",
