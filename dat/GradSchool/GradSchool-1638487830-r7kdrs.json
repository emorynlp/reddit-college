  "text": "Hello everyone, \n\nI am feeling terrible and using this subreddit to vent/confess oftentimes. I am a 4th year PhD student in Biological Sciences and do you just have those weeks when nothing goes right?\n\nI have accepted the fact that mistakes happen but I don't know it should be at this stage. Today, for example I messed my unique indices and my replicates went from 3 to 1. Of course I grabbed the wrong tube. This is such a silly mistake and there is nothing I can do other than trying to find solutions to fix it. My advisor was baffled at this and she just wasn't expecting something from a PhD candidate. \n\nI am looking for comfort I guess and hopefully it may make the new people in first years of their graduate career feel a little better about themselves. \n\nThank you for reading!",

      "text": "I have worked with fantastic scientists who have been doing this for 40 years and they still make mistakes. With experience you will get better at preventing yourself from making them, but you\u2019re only human and they will still happen now and then. \n\nMy two suggestions are to look at your mistakes critically and try to identify what leads you to making them - I\u2019m especially bad if I have a migraine, get interrupted, or both. I\u2019ve come up with ways to try to catch myself. The second thing I would suggest is to try to show yourself the same grace you would show someone else. I\u2019m still working on that one myself - I\u2019m great at reassuring people that shit happens but still really hard on myself.",

      "text": "Mistakes literally come with being human. Grad school or professionalism doesn't just eliminate that.\n\nThat's a pretty ridiculous reaction from your advisor and the whole \"this is beneath you\" thing is disingenuous.\n\nObviously it's a good way to be insightful about your work process and take steps to prevnt future missteps in the future, but the idea that making mistakes at all is somehow beneath you is nonsense. \n\nIt's good to kind of recognize that behavior now because a lot of people in managerial positions will often have this \"I need you to produce exactly what I need in this very exact way and how dare you not be perfect\" mindset. You're going to make mistakes. What would be more productive from them is reading the situation and your process to understand how to prevent them from being repeats.",

He had collected his product in one of those  cute little 15 mL beakers. Finished his prep, he bundled up all the stuff on his bench - including the little beaker - in a bench 'diaper' pad and tossed it in the biohazard waste bin.",
