  "text": "Hello, I\u2019m what we call a \u00ab\u00a0former gifted child\u00a0\u00bb. During all middle and high school, I never really worked and graduated with honors. But during college, I realized that I didn\u2019t know how to study, and now I barely get my years.\nI somehow managed to get my law degree (thanks to Covid !), and I\u2019m now in master. (Still in law)\n\nThe thing is, I feel like I\u2019m gonna give up, I have no idea of how to study, I can barely focus, and I had my first grade which is really bad, 8/20..\nI can\u2019t also learn things (each courses have like around 100 pages to learn so imagine..) because every time I\u2019m in front of my lessons, it doesn\u2019t seem logical to me, or I end up thinking about 4738271629 things because my brain is constantly overthinking everything (for instance while trying to work for an exam I can think about why there\u2019s no McDonald\u2019s on the side of highways\u2026)\n\nHow can I learn how to study, when I\u2019ve never did it in my entire life ?\n\nThanks you :)",

      "text": "You can set small goals. I have adhd and that helps me a lot. Sometimes I can\u2019t focus on anything and sometimes I get hyper focused. So I try respecting myself and setting realistic goals and sometimes rewarding myself with small things so I can relax. \n\nYou might be still a very intelligent person experiencing burnout. So self care is always important. Setting a healthy schedule and exercising helps with focusing a lot. \n\nBut that\u2019s my main advice: realistic goals. We often want to do way more and when we fail the disappointment with ourselves makes everything worse.\n\nBut remember that discipline is something difficult (at least for me) to develop and keep. So it won\u2019t happen over night. It\u2019s a work in progress forever and needs patience. And keep in mind that every progress is a progress still.",

Learn how to learn, and work with your brain. I also was someone who rarely needed to work- even until graduating with my BA. Now I'm in a masters + 30 program and I had to learn how to study hahaha.",

      "text": "Hi! ADHD and severe Learning disabilities here. Sounds like you just need to hack you brain a little on what works best for you. I can relate to this as I recently just had to figure out how to properly study and what everyone was giving me advice on did not work. This may not work for you since everyone is different but you could try! \n\n1. If you\u2019re a visual person- white boards/notes on iPads are super helpful. I\u2019ve literally created my entire room into pretty much a giant whiteboard with the wall adhesive they have on Amazon.\n\n2. Buy a figiter. Sounds stupid but if your brain needs something to focus on since it\u2019s used to working in four different directions. keep it busy! \n\n3. Background music. Trying different focus music but turning it almost the entire way down where you can\u2019t hear it also helps with your brain trying to figure out what to focus on. I thought this was weird but my therapist has a background in music therapy and it works! There are songs that have been processed in 8d and 16d, that some say help those either with ADHD or need support with focus.  You can go to youtube and put 8d or 16d in the search engine. \n\n4. Check out aliabdaal on YouTube- great study methods explained. \n\n5. Where you study will make a huge difference. Try studying in different places throughout the week! \n\n6. Turn that phone on silent or get a application blocking app! I also through mine in a different room. \n\n7. Also if you\u2019re a procrastinator- that\u2019s okay just utilize those times of hyper focus efficiently and manage your time. Break down your large tasks into small sections and start with the hardest one first. \n\nI hope this helps! If you have any questions feel free to message me. (:",

For example my figet tool is like a ring I wear with some beads that slide. Also standing up and working or like moving while working and reading may help. Just whatever your body is feeling allow that. And when you have thoughts that pop into your brain, keep a pen and paper next to you. Brain dump them on a list, get them out for later so you're not storing that in your head. We can only remember so much, so a bunch of busy thoughts can make it difficult to remember things. We literally need to get them out of our head. \n\nLastly, my friend does this that helps him. He said he will fill up a big glass of water and he has to read all of his work.until be finishes that drink. Then he can take a break, refill it and goes back to work. Essentially just techniques to quiet things down. \n\nThis is through my own personal experience so it may not work for everyone but I hope this can be somewhat helpful!! \ud83e\udd70",

In high school and even the beginning of undergrad, I never had any issues and studied very little but still got top grades.\n\nI would recommend seeing someone about it since you are having trouble focusing and from your description, it sounds like you have a lot of the symptoms of ADD. Sometimes when people are \"smart\" as kids, they fall through the cracks and don't realize they have a problem until they experience more challenging coursework.\n\nOtherwise: always have a plan. \"From x to y time I am going to study for this class. I will start by reviewing my notes and textbook and then doing these practice problems in the text book. Then I will check the answer key and analyze what I did right or wrong. I will also write down questions to ask my professor if I am not understanding a specific problem or concept.\"\n\nAlso, anki. Download anki and make flashcards. Anki changed my life. Anki is customizable and 1000X better than quizlet or any other flashcard app. It's also free.\n\nAnother note: eliminate distractions. Put your phone on silent, turn off the tv, block off reddit. My husband has the tv on 24/7 so I invested in some ear plugs to block out noise. With my ADD, any aberrant sounds immediately take me out of study mode. Like I can't even listen to music when I study because it will distract me. Ear plugs were a HUGE help.\n\nHaving a set plan makes a world of difference, but make sure your health is in order first and foremost.",

At least in mathematics, this approach turned out to be completely unfeasible beyond the first year or so - and by the time we got to measure theory and differential geometry I just gave up. Rather than training my brain to work with manifolds (by doing lots and lots of practice questions), I'd sit there whining about not \"understanding\" them.\n\nIn contrast, the students  who focused on replicating the steps shown in the lecture in their weekly assignments without overthinking it (and who accepted that there is no point in getting hung up on that one question on the exam that is designed to restrict straight As to the absolute top of the class), they survived and, in time, developed a mathematical intuition.\n\nMy academic advisor didn't comprehend why I'd drop out because, objectively, my grades weren't awful yet. But I had sabotaged myself with this \"It has to seem logical to me before I can do anything else with it\" mindset to a point where no salvaging seemed possible. Don't be me.",
