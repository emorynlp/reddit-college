  "text": "Hi all, I'm currently in the process of applying to clinical psychology PhD programs in the US. Although I haven't even submitted my applications yet, I really want to feel prepared for applying to fellowships, but I have no idea where to start. I'd really appreciate if anyone can point me in the right direction with knowing the basics of how they work, how to find them, and when you need to apply. Thank you!",
