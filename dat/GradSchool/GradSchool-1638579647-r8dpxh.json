  "title:": "Denied from my 5 potential labs.",
  "text": "My program has us do \u201cinterviews\u201d with 5 groups over the course of the semester and then rank them. I found out today every lab I interviewed with is full (other students in my cohort who listed them got into them) and I can\u2019t join them. Is this normal? I don\u2019t really know where to go from here as I wasn\u2019t looking into any other labs. The graduate studies director hasn\u2019t been much help in terms of what to do, and they are pressuring me to pick a lab from the 3 un-filled labs by the end of the semester, even if their research does not align with my studies (materials chemistry). I know nothing about any of the unfilled groups aside from their basic areas of research because they were not interesting to me when i picked groups to interview. Any advice?",

      "text": "I would go and at least talk to the last 3 labs and then work from there. It sometimes can be hard to tell exactly what a group is currently working on from publications, websites, etc. Maybe a collaboration or co-advising arrangement with one of the groups you were more interested in would be an option.",
