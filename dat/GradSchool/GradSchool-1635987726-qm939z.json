  "title:": "The contrast in how my graduate institution treats mental health vs. my undergraduate school",
  "text": "I am a GTA. A student of mine just had an assignment excused due to a family member falling seriously ill. I am glad my student got this care from the school because I never did as an undergraduate. \n\nAs an undergrad I had a really terrible year and had to handle it with no support. First my parents and I were evicted from my childhood home, then my (then recent) ex's family was murdered, then I was sexually assaulted. All in a 5 month period. I ended up dropping from my summer classes due to the eviction. I was give a five day extension on two assignments for the murders. And the school therapist was a complete victim blamer calling me \"adventurous\" for being sexually assaulted. When I expressed extreme mental stress to my professors, it was often suggested that I drop out if I couldn't handle school and life at the same time. I was often mocked for not being able to handle school during that time, which I was assured was no where as hard as the real world.\n\nI am glad my current school cares more about their student's well being, but where was this support when I was an undergrad? My past has made me have some work-horse tendencies, refusing to rest and tend to myself when needed for fear of consequences. I have been (figuratively) beaten down into thinking the deadlines are more important than my physical or emotional well being. It doesn't matter how sick or what mental state I am in, I meet the deadlines and never ask for help anymore.",
