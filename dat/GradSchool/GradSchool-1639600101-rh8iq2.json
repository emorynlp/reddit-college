  "title:": "Silly that I have to ask this, but is there any shame in working retail while doing a PhD?",
  "text": "I'm still in the first year of my program and have thought about picking up a part time job to help supplement my income. I'm able to get by OK with my stipend, but I'd like to be a little more comfortable. I've applied to jobs tutoring part time (online and in-person), but I've also looked into potentially working retail/restaurant (strictly) on the weekends. I've got years of experience in both from my undergrad years, and with how badly places are needing people, I figure, why not? \n\nI think I'm just hesitant because it seems like every other PhD student around me/I've known either had a SO who helped pay for rent/food/etc, or had a family that was helping them, or simply didn't need to worry about money. I'm none of those things\n\nHas anyone here worked retail during their program? How'd it go?",

If someone acts like it\u2019s shameful, or embarrassing on my part, I lose respect for them. And if they don\u2019t understand the need to work a part-time job for livelihood, that honestly reflects worse on them. \n\nThe landscaping was tangentially related to my field, albeit not something that a masters student would usually be doing, and I used to justify it by saying \u201coh, it\u2019s covid, it\u2019s outdoors work. I\u2019m happy to have a safe job.\u201d People usually understood that, especially because I worked full time over the summer. \n\nNow I don\u2019t care. Ah. you\u2019re uncomfortable with the fact that I moonlight as a farmhand outside the city? Don\u2019t care, I get free tomatoes and an income. And it\u2019s nice to do something where I\u2019m not using higher thinking. \n\nThere is shame in turning your nose up at taking retail/service/labor jobs, and there is absolutely no shame in working them.",

      "text": "Not having people to help you like you described isn't shameful. It isn't talked about as often (depending on what you're getting your higher ed in) but it's very much a privilege to have family and loved ones who can support you, and very difficult to make your own way.  \n\n\n\n\nMy biggest warning for you working in retail/restaurant as someone who did the same for a time during her education (11 years retail) is that it is *emotionally* taxing, and to know when to bail versus feel obligated to stay.  A lot of those jobs depend on people who can't walk if they are pushed to their limits and will continue to ask more of you, in ways that are very sympathetic-sounding. Everyone is overworked, underpaid, trying to survive. So make sure you have firm boundaries and a willingness to walk if you are treated unfairly or unkindly, or even asked to do more than you said you were able to commit to. To be willing to be \"mean\" if it means that you get home on time and give yourself time to relax. Do not fall for the \"well they seem nice and they only want help once\" because you'll likely have turnover and people will be desperate for the one worker who isn't already burnt out to pick up the slack from those who already left/are leaving. \n\n\n\n   On top of that, keep an eye on what tasks fall to the wayside when it's crunchtime; my grocery had multiple outbreaks during covid-19 because they would scold people for trying to refill cleaning supplies, for wearing masks, for staying home if they caught a fever, and it was only when it became unavoidable did they start following conduct standards around covid-19 for safety.  I could afford to stop working for awhile so I did, but retail knew that I was friendly and cared about doing a good job so they often tried to compel me emotionally (\"It'd be *so helpful* of you, and everyone is *so stressed* \"). Don't let them do that to you.",

Sorry if I sounded overly cautious, the additional pressure in working through covid-19 in grocery was really eye opening for me in terms of the increase of aggression from both managers and customers. I knew how people were usually but it was strange to see the shifts happening real time, and sometimes it meant when I went home afterwards I felt a lot crankier. If you've already navigated leaving jobs and handling poor management/bad treatment you're ahead of the game vs a lot of other new hires right now, and like you said there is a great market for being choosy vs having to take whatever offers you get.  The only reservation I had working while being in school outside of that sort of stress was the risk of exposure, since my program had specific stipulations if I became exposed and my job became qualified as essential.  All that meant was that I had to ping the student health center and they reduced some of my attendance requirements/had to do the whole zoom class thing if it happened though, as well as an infield hour reduction (like they dropped 50 hours from my total requirement for program completion).",
