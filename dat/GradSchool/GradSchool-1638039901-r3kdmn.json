  "text": "I will probably have to do a capstone project by next semester, if I don't get an internship by then. I know the faculty advisor I should talk to and she offered me some projects to pick, but I haven't made my final decision yet and the semester ends in like 2-3 weeks. I am not even entirely if I can choose a topic by next week.\n\nHow fucked am I? The reason I am posting this here is that I know no one else who is in this kind of situation.",

      "text": "Question for you - are you worried about making the wrong decision for a capstone topic? Are any of the topics that your advisor provided for you something that you can do and make a capstone paper out of it? I was like this for my thesis topic and it\u2019s alright but it\u2019s in the area of my interest in my MA program. I\u2019m at the point where I like it enough to write about the thesis topic and working on getting it done. The one thing that has helped me a lot to reframe is that thesis/capstone is the requirement to get my masters degree/connections in field/further jobs. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to write the capstone, make it yours. Good luck!",

          "text": "Honestly, not sure. I want to look into something related to UI and how attention is given to visual accessibility when developing software (am a software engineer). The topics that the faculty member proposed were all related, but I guess my biggest question is can I do it despite having very little experience with UI design.",
