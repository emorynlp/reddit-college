  "title:": "Advice on how I can convince my dad support me to pursue my PhD?",
  "text": "Currently I\u2019m an MS student about to do research in controls engineering with biomed applications. I will be applying for phd to study materials science also with biomed applications next year. My dad supports my aspirations to be a scientist and a researcher in academia, but not a materials scientist. My mom is supportive, but every other day or week my dad and I fight over my strong desire to be a materials scientist and it\u2019s so exhausting.\n\nHe keeps telling me that there is no future in materials science (clearly not true) and that I will be making below 50k (???) if there is even a job on the market (there clearly are jobs lol). My dad is one of those classic Indian dads who give their kids 3 career choices like doctor, engineer, or lawyer. He got his wish and got an engineer in the family, yet still wants to have a say in what my career should be. \n\nI\u2019m just not going to listen to him and go ahead with my materials science phd applications next year, but I feel that it would be good to have his support. My dad keeps telling me that \u201cbecause he has seen more seasons and days than I have\u201d, he has more more experience than I do and therefore should listen to him. And while I understand that I\u2019m obviously not as experienced, there are things that I know more about than him and that\u2019s just hard for him to accept. I know what I\u2019m doing and I\u2019m confident. Anyone else who\u2019s in a similar situation with their parents or have any advice? Sorry for the long rant but I\u2019m lost every rn",

Heck, it probably would have even saved our relationship in the end. I thought I was being a good daughter by following their incorrect advice, but if I had things to do over again I would do them very very differently.\n\nEvery generation, things change in the world and in the job market. Sounds like you've done your research and you know you're not going to be jobless, so follow your heart! And don't care what they think.",

My Indian parents, relatives, and even neighbours had an opinion on my career. They said this field has zero job prospects - and watching animals was a hobby, not a real career. I was tired of arguing so I took up a sem-through project in a molecular biology lab even when I had no interest in it. \n\nThe result - sleep cycle destroyed, mental health messed up, GPA at its lowest, I looked like a zombie that year. When I came home in the summer, and my parents saw me, we had a proper conversation and decided I'm switching labs. It's not just about \"scope of the field\".. it's about what you're interested in. If you're interested enough, any field can be great. I think I did pretty good in Eco-evo, now I am pursuing a PhD in Finland and my parents are happy too. Just go for it, OP! They will eventually catch up and be happy for you.",

I remind him that MBAs mostly take classes from economists and not to worry about that anymore. He hasn't brought it up since then, but I can tell he's still concerned about my career after I finish my program.\n\nAnyways, even if your parents were supportive, they would still have their minds set about what they want for you. Something you could do is to show him that you're making a good decision. It sounds like he's mostly concerned about outcomes in your chosen field; if you can show him placement records from the programs you're looking at and expected salaries, maybe he'll feel better.\n\nSurprisingly, a lot of people still go into bad programs and fields with few job opportunities because they don't look far enough ahead. You can read here and in /r/askacademia about people who can't find jobs for months after finishing or are stuck in low-paying postdoc positions for years. You could certainly end up struggling in the job market with a materials science degree if your program is really bad.",
