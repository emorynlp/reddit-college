  "title:": "Is it detrimental to be joining a new lab with a new professor",
  "text": "Hello,\nI recently got accepted into a MS program with full GRA funding in an area that I am very passionate about. However, the faculty member who approached me is not someone I have expressed my interest in working with through email correspondence (the professor I wanted to work with passed my resume on to him). He is someone who recently moved to the university and has just setup his lab last year.\n\nI'm inclined to join his lab primary because of the area of research as well as the funding opportunity. However, I'm very concerned about the state of his research and what I will be joining into.\n\nI do intend to pursue a doctoral program if things go well which is why I'm wondering if I should be careful to accept the offer.\n\nAny suggestions?",

      "text": "Is this professor's research something that interests you? If it is, I'd start a conversation with them. Be upfront about your goals (do you want to teach at a university and run your own lab in the future? Do you want to go into industry?). \n\nOne thing to consider is forming your committee. Even though this professor wasn't your first choice, it might be a good opportunity for you. If you really want to work with your first choice, you might still be able to have them on your committee. \n\nFrom what I've heard, newer professors tend to be more hands-on with their students. A lot of them want to be an active part of your research. Is that mentoring style something you want? Or do you prefer a more hands-off approach? There might also be less flexibility in terms of projects because the professor is still establishing themselves and their research niche.\n\nAnother thing to consider: newer professors typically don't have many publications yet, and a lot of institutions have a \"publish or perish\" mentality when  it comes to faculty. So this lab might offer you the chance to put out a fair amount of papers before you graduate. That will look really good when you start applying to PhD programs.\n\nThat was a bit of an essay, bit I hope it helps!",

I think you should at least meet with the PI and see how that goes. From my experience, it's normally a good thing to have your CV passed along and it seems the PI is interested in having you as a student.",

              "text": "Sure:\n\n* My PI was very dependent on a collaborator at our university and didn't have the technical experience for the project she wanted me to work on. They hired a very inexperienced lab manager and a post-doc who is wonderful, but also has no experience in the assays I am doing. \n\n* The publish or perish mentality was always present but got worse over time. Because of the pandemic our lab has not published and I believe that is a major stressor in their life. They don't take it out on us in any aggressive way, but there are plenty of insinuations about working harder and longer and better. It has created a very stressful environment when presenting experiments that do not go well.\n\n* As a new PI, they seemed to be pulled in multiple directions (committees, meetings, seminars, etc) that made them less available in general than I anticipated. I went from working in a lab where I could basically drop in on the PI when needed, so having to schedule time with my PI for every little thing became frustrating. \n\n* Things just don't work sometimes in a new lab. Copy the *exact* same PCR that works in a different lab? No bands. It can weigh on you after a while. An established lab has established protocols. \n\nBut yeah, I still think you should trust your gut. I know people who enjoyed being in a new lab.",
