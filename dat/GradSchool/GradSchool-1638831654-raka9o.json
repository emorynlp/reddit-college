  "text": "Hey everybody, please help a student who\u2019s working with enzymes for the first time and can\u2019t find a simple information \ud83d\ude29\nI\u2019m working with pepsin and I am basing myself on some papers who report enzyme concentration in % (w/w). However, i have a sample that is like a \u201cslurry\u201d with around 80% of moisture. Should I base myself on the weight of the whole sample or just the 20% without the water?\n\nAny tips? Working with enzymes has been very confusing to me lol I appreciate a little help!",
