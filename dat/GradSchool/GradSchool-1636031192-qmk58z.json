  "text": "I'm interested in a M.Sc. in ecology but every ecology department website I visit mentions the need to contact a professor to work with before applying. When I go to that professor's website, most of them mention that I need to include my research experience and/or an example question that would fit with their lab.\n\nMy problem is that my B.Sc. is in biology but my plan was teaching so I did no research in undergrad, and my Master's is in Teaching Biology. \n\nI've emailed a couple professors and haven't heard back. My GPA is high for both degrees, bit I know research experience is heavily weighted since that's what I'll need to do. \n\nDo I even have a chance at grad school with no research experience?",

      "text": "For research degrees, it is really helpful to have demonstrated success and satisfaction doing research. Most people find out that it is a lot more frustrating than they thought, and coursework is a weak predictor of that.\n\nThere is usually a lot more latitude for MS than PhD, but you still need some indicators of potential success. Be specific about why an MS is essential for your career plans when you are already fully qualified to teach biology. \n\nThe most research-oriented ecology programs may not offer the MS at all, and put all their energy into doctoral researchers. Keep an eye out for that.",

I'll edit my post but my intention is to leave teaching and work for a government organization such as USFWS, USFS, state forestry dept., etc.\n\nI have noticed that on the website for the school, it lists MS degrees and how to apply, but when I visit the websites for the faculty labs, they only mention spots for undergraduates or PhDs. Does this mean I shouldn't bother contacting them?",

              "text": "Maybe try to work as a research assistant or field assistant (as another commenter said) to get some experience under your belt. From personal experience having a high GPA but no experience makes it much harder for professors to take an interest in. \n\nYou can always contact them and ask if they have spots for MS students, sometimes professors forget to update their website. But, if their lab website says they only have spots for undergrad or PhD students don't be surprised if the answer is no.",

All of my rec letters came from that job (my boss and other PIs we worked with) and that year got me into better programs than I would have otherwise.",
