  "text": "My first quarter started last week and was assigned several articles to read, I read through them all only to feel like I have absolutely no idea what I read. Or I do, kind of...but no response forms in my head other than an 'uh huh'. I wrote notes, but they're completely useless since clearly I don't know how to write notes and pretty much only copied down points I thought were important, not any of my own thoughts ( which I don't have apparently)\n\nOn top of that all I was asked to do was write a 1 paragraph response on Canvas and I couldn't even do that. First, not feeling like I comprehended. Second, reading everyone else's responses left me feeling completely intimidated. It's not even a paper and I'm freaking out. \n\nI have no idea what I'm doing. It's been 8 years since I graduated undergrad, only back then I didn't really do this kind of reading/writing since I studied in a creative discipline that didn't require anything like what I'm doing. I don't know how to write academically. I feel like I know nothing anymore.\n\nhelp!",

      "text": "Some journal articles will be outside your scope of understanding. You are not expected to know everything. When I was in grad school and had to read papers outside my area of expertise (genetics or cancer treatment) everything would glaze over. However I found that areas I did know better (environmental toxicology, microbiology, phycology) I understood better.   \n\n\nSome tips for dissecting journal articles that may help you start to form opinions based on what you read:  \n\n\n* **What was their hypothesis?**  \nIf you can understand what they are trying to discover or prove it may greatly aid in how you read the paper from here on out.\n* **Was their sample size adequate for proving their findings?**  \nIf their sample size is too small or the age group outside of the target being studied is it really a viable study. Are they making claims like \"56% of the global population would eat salad forever\" when they only sampled 10 people aged 25-40 outside of an American Whole Foods. \n* **What were their controls? Would there have been better controls to use for this particular study?**  \nIn one of my classes the professor took us through how to dissect a journal and extract the information (each week it rotated through a handful of graduate students). We got the opportunity to ask and see examples of what makes a bad journal article. This came up as one of the worst things done. In the specific article I remember the controls for a certain chemical being applied to frog eggs used one control for 30% of the tests and a completely different control for the remaining 70% of chemicals. It made no sense and called into question the validity of the results. \n* **Do their findings agree with or disagree with previous findings reported by researchers studying the same area? If their findings are way outside the norm what may have caused this? Are they accurate or are they presenting the data in a way that agrees with their hypothesis?**  \nSometimes researchers can use specific data analysis to make their results more impactful. For example are they using the right regression analysis of their data? Did they use the right conversion formula for calculating protein content? Why did they present this data as a histogram where it could have been summarized in a table? \n* **Can this research be combined with any adjacent areas of study to improve other disciplines?**  \nFinding commonalities and ways this research could be applied to other areas of study may help you see the global impact it has. If you can ground what you read to every day life then it will help you understand the study better overall.  \n* **Who funded the study?**  \nThis one is huge. Say we read a study where the findings say that high concentrations of bleach entering into water ways is completely safe and within legal limits. Their hypothesis is well thought out, their sample size is appropriate, controls are good, and there is nothing going on with the data. However we look and find out that the study was provided funding by Clorox Bleach. This should set off flags that there is research bias happening. Clorox Bleach wants to prove that discharging high concentrations of bleach into water ways is safe so they may have only presented a small fraction of the total data and research performed. You can typically find who funded the study in the same area of the journal article as the acknowledgements (usually at the end of the paper).   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps a bit. No one is a master at this when they first start out. These skills are grown over time so please don't feel too down about it.",

      "text": ">I read through them all only to feel like I have absolutely no idea what I read.\n\nWhat I noticed here is that you didn't say how many times you read them.\n\nGraduate school readings are not necessarily meant to be digested in one read. \n\nEspecially academic articles. Which are not written for you as an audience. But rather written for academics with a lot more knowledge about the subject than you.\n\nFor particularly difficult texts, I would often skim them on first read just to get a general sense of what they were about. And then read them very closely for a second read. But of course some people might need to do two close readings.\n\nOn the upside, if you are a PhD student, eventually it will get easier as you get a better knowledge of the subject matter of the field. This is a primary reason for the study that goes into preliminary exams. So you can reach that level of being able to understand what you are reading before moving on to the dissertation.",

In a humanities-focused field I'd start my paragraph with summarizing the reading, then use that to support my opinion on whether it makes sense or doesn't make sense -- that is, do I agree with it or not. If you've discussed any general principles or techniques in class, tie those in (did they use or not use those techniques in the reading? was that helpful or not helpful?). This might be kind of an amateur way to do it (I'm not in humanities), but maybe it's a decent starting point that you can eventually evolve into a more focused method.",
