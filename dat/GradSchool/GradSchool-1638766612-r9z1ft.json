  "title:": "High anxiety during finals for my doctoral program. Any words of advice?",
  "text": "I am in my first year of a doctoral program, in an allied health career. We move as a cohort. It\u2019s about 30ish of us and we\u2019re in our toughest semester as the admins say. Course load is huge. \n\nI need a B- or else I am in academic probation. I\u2019m doing fine in every class except 1. This class, has a tough professor. Very tough. So tough that when I take her exams, I feel like I always second guess myself because I feel like I\u2019m always being tricked during a question. \n\nI near failed my midterm and realized I could\u2019ve gotten all the questions right if I didn\u2019t change my answer. Why did I change it so often? Cause I hear her in the back of my head and second guess myself. \n\nAnyway, I need a D on this final to pass with that B. Although I feel more confident, every inch of me is imagining myself in that room waiting to submit my exam, sweating to see my score. I get red thinking about submitting my score this week and it\u2019s just as bad as my midterm. I\u2019ve poured all my studying into this class that I\u2019ve been neglecting my other courses so much, I actually feel like I\u2019ll bomb my other finals. I feel clueless and scared. \nPeople really talk in my cohort and I don\u2019t want to be the person that doesn\u2019t pass although I\u2019m probably not the only one.  People have cried over this class. My anxiety might influence how the rest of my finals go. Never felt like this before but I have so much on the line.",

      "text": "Hi, friend.  I have extreme test anxiety, myself, and I've had to take exams through full panic attacks in the past (and will likely have to do that again on Friday), so I can empathize with what you're feeling.  I don't know if anything anyone else can say will help ease that for you; I know that outside input doesn't do a lot for me, because my anxiety is about what is going on in my own head.  \n\n\nAll that being said: breathe.  If other people have cried about this class, that says to me that your struggles are not a personal failing, but a mark of just how difficult this class actually is. You know it is exceptionally difficult and you are doing your best to prepare. Can you make pre-tests for yourself?  What would help to boost your own confidence, so you don't second-guess yourself so much?  Can you have a member of your cohort quiz you?\n\nA previous professor of mine suggested that I try to think about exams differently.  He suggested that I think of them as a way to show him how much I know, rather than something designed to trip me up or make me fail.  His suggestion was that I consider them trivia, and that the exam was a game between him and me.  I can't honestly say that is a strategy that worked for me, but maybe it is a strategy that will work for you or someone else.\n\nIf nothing else, maybe it will help to know that you aren't alone in feeling this way; grad school is monumentally difficult because that is how it is designed.  You aren't failing because you're struggling;  you're struggling because this is hard.  And this internet stranger believes in you.  Breathe.  Trust your instincts and your preparation.  You can do this.",

          "text": "Thank you for this. I\u2019m glad I came back to this post because it really helped. I was basically on the verge of getting probation before this final. A stroke of miracle happened, and I ended up getting the highest score in the final exam. Not sure how that happened, probably the luckiest days of my life considering how much I bombed it before. \n\nMy heart was beating so hard the entire time, I was self hating on myself. Test anxiety sucks. I know I won\u2019t do good every time like this, it was a damn Miracle but thank you for empathizing with me for a bit.",
