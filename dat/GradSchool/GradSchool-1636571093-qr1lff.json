  "text": "So, I've recently started my master's in English Literature and there are a lot of readings that to me seem pointless. Extra readings basically. My question for you all on here is, how much time and effort do you put in daily and for your readings? Do you do all the readings that are assigned?",

      "text": "One of the unspoken rules about graduate school is that no one reads everything. That said, it is important to read as much as you can, or skim as much as you can, if only to know that these arguments and readings exist in case you need them in the future. Since you've just begun, I really recommend keeping a running bibliography or using a citation organizer like Zotero to keep brief (very brief) notes about everything you've read.",

      "text": "In my experience this semester with grad school, the readings become relevant once you have to write the final paper for the module/class. But also, you shouldn't read every reading line for line, that's probably impossible given the amount of time in the day for most people. You should try to read the intro/conclusion and skim, depending on the length of the reading (this is not a comprehensive explanation of successful skim reading, but lots of people have written about successfully skimming readings)",

So, I'm in a course that's called \"academic writing for graduate students\" and some of the reading is really helpful, it's teaching us about critical reviews and literature reviews. However, on top of the reading, our prof also sends is to a bunch of websites and blogs and that's where I get confused and wonder if I can carry pick what I read. After a while, having nearly 15 different websites and blogs all telling me what a lit review is my mind is overwhelmed and confused.",

              "text": ">I suppose if I really think about it, nothing in university is pointless.\n\nRight. Your literature professors will want you to avoid hyperbole and be more precise in your language use than that. Even in informal writing assignments. Best to get in the habit everywhere :)\n\n>our prof also sends is to a bunch of websites and blogs\n\nIf your teacher is sending you links to whole websites with lots of pages and blogs with lots of posts, my guess is those might be extra resources for you to use as an FYI. You could gauge how closely you need to look at them by how or whether or not they're brought up during class. It could easily be enough to glance through them to know what's there in case you need them later.\n\nIf in your course calendar, there are specific pages on websites or specific blog posts listed as the reading for the next class meeting, then I would imagine your professor expects you to be familiar with them.\n\nAnd certainly, if you're having any difficulty with any writing assignments, and those websites and blogs could assist with that, you would be expected to use them.",
