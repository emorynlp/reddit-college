  "text": "My husband is strongly considering this career pathway and will be soon applying to grad schools. We seem to find an array of different answers from various websites, so I was wondering, what kinds of things do you do every day, and, if you\u2019re comfortable, what is your yearly salary? \n\nAlso: Would you do something else if you could go back and have a do over? \n\nTLDR what do *you* do, how much do you make, any regrets?",

      "text": "Does he have a bachelor's in EEB? I ask because \"what kind of things you do\" everyday is so varied that it makes me wonder what his previous experience is, and how much he knows what he's getting into. Because EEB isn't a \"career pathway\" like other grad degrees are. There's no obvious jobs for an EEB graduate. I'd say it's much closer to doing something like... history in terms of employability. \n\nGenerally EEB is less employable that more applied versions of ecology (ex, resource management, wildlife resources, etc), and most of the pay/benefits is pretty garbage. EEB is, in my opinion, one of the least employable fields in STEM. That doesn't mean it won't work out, but after years in the field and being paid at \"like you have a graduate degree\" level, my pay and benefits were still garbage, and I went back to school for something else.\n\nI wouldn't join a lab without hearing what their previous graduates have done, and seeing if it matches your goals. These days, it seems a lot of people just do enough stats to go do data science.",

This is what we had collectively determined, that it\u2019s so broad it kind of gets put on the back burner in terms of trying to make it a career. He\u2019s interested in, and has been working his entire academic life towards a conservation approach. His ultimate goal is continuing to work on conservation research, which he\u2019s really loved during undergrad, and at home as a hobby. \n\nMay I ask, where did you go yourself? Anything to look into at this point is something.",

EEB is more theoretical. It sounds like it would be helpful to look into different types of programs and sort this out.\n\nIt sounds like he's done research for people? He should be talking to them for their perspectives.",

      "text": "Second the advice to ask about graduates from the _particular_ labs he is looking at, and also to avoid cornering himself into a particular degree title. Some programs called 'ecology' may be great; there are also labs that produce lots of people who are employed in the field with other titles (biology, environmental science, natural resources management for a few). Try to talk with recent graduates and ask about what particular skills they found useful in getting a job, and also think about the particular career. Wildlife jobs, jobs with 'fun' fieldwork (eg in tropical rainforests) or with exciting endangered species are much harder to get and usually lower pay than, eg, programming for remote sensing data analysis. So, it's a wide market with lots of different potential outcomes.",
