  "title:": "UPDATE: I told my PI I\u2019m mastering out. It went well!",
  "text": "Sorry to add to the flurry of \u201cquitting PhD\u201d posts, but I wanted to give a quick update. I posted a few days ago asking for advice about how to tell my difficult PI that I\u2019m leaving with a masters. Well, I did it this morning, and it went MUCH better than expected!\n\nI was ready for side eyes, pursed lips, and clenched fists. But, when I first told her, her response was more along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that sounds like it was difficult decision. I want you to do what\u2019s best for you. Let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s next.\u201d \n\nMy PI has a tendency to be very hot and cold\u2014if you tell her something mildly annoying on a bad day, be prepared...so I think I caught her on a good day, haha. We still have some things to discuss (how much work I have left to do, exact end date, etc) but this first meeting made me feel like it will be a smooth process rather than fraught with hurt feelings.\n\nI will also say: I would never have had the courage to do this if not for the wonderful therapy I received last semester. If I didn\u2019t learn to be more confident and willing to stand up for myself and what is best for me, rather than just doing what is expected, I would have continued and been miserable for absolutely no reason for at least another three years. \n\nI\u2019m so happy and relieved!",

          "text": "My stipend is 35k (I\u2019m in a very high cost of living area; my first year I was paying 65% of my stipend in rent and now it\u2019s ~only~ 50%). But the salary for my new job is 50k, plus 11 holidays off, 18 days PTO, 401k and good benefits (I\u2019m in the US, so this is all pretty good to me). Postdoc usually make that level of salary but won\u2019t necessarily get those kinds of benefits (I\u2019ve never heard of a postdoc getting a 401k).\n\nThe big thing for me is that the position I have now is the exact same kind of position I would have applied to, even if I finished my PhD. So I\u2019m getting to more direct experience + higher salary + better benefits much sooner than I otherwise would have.\n\n(I\u2019m also planning on moving with my fianc\u00e9 who\u2019s starting med school in the midwest, where COL will be waaaay lower. I\u2019m estimating rent will then be 15-25% of my monthly take home).",

I'm just over 2 years into a 4 year PhD and considering mastering out - but I haven't gotten any research done in the last year due to covid so I'd have to work for another year so I'd be getting a masters after 3 years instead of the usual 2 if I take that option.",

          "text": "Thanks! I\u2019m a 3rd year right now, so i\u2019ve been in my program for about 2.5 years (one year for rotation, year and a half in my current lab). I think I have about 3-3.5 years of time left if I stayed to finish. That being said, people in my lab tend to stick around longer than I\u2019ve seen in other labs, so it could be up to 4.\n\nThat\u2019s a tough situation. Does your program have specific requirements for mastering out? In mine, you basically complete your qualifying exam and write a research paper to be able to leave with a masters.",

              "text": "Thanks for your response, that's really helpful! I'm in Ireland and our programmes are pretty fixed here, it's very rare to see someone stay past 4 years. The requirements for a research masters are usually two years of research and a dissertation written on that research. I'm just worried since I basically only have one year of research because of covid I'd need to do another year. \n\nI plan to tell my supervisor next week that I've been feeling demotivated and disconnected from my work the last 6 or so months but unless he brings up the option of mastering out I'm going to sit on it for another month at least to make sure it's really what I want, it's a tough decision to make! I've been doing sessions with a career guidance counselor and currently taking a tonne of tests to figure out where my strengths and interests lie. It's funny how covid has made us all super introspective, probably one of the only upsides!",

              "text": "Sure, I\u2019m in a systems neuroscience lab and I primarily use ephys to study a songbird model. I have some coding background (primarily in R, which I consider myself to be highly proficient) and a lot of statistics (multiple regression, machine learning). I also have had pretty good success with writing/submitting grants and fellowships. So I\u2019m looking into jobs as a data analyst or grant writer at nonprofits, medical centers, universities. These are the same types of jobs I would look into after I had my PhD, and after discussing it with professionals in the nonprofit world I decided to leave with the masters.\n\nFor myself, a masters will be enough to get my foot in the door at these organizations and I can work my way up to a higher level position if I want. The additional training from the second half of my PhD won\u2019t change my career trajectory because I don\u2019t want jobs that require it, or I can get the same job through practical experience rather than education. \n\nMy lab in and of itself does not require extensive statistical modeling, but I really like it so I specifically took classes and spent time learning about it (even though, again, t-tests, chi-sq, and ANOVAs are all I basically need for my actual lab work). I think this experience will be important in my job search, way more than my experience with ephys or histology.\n\nWith a masters, you could also get a job as a higher level tech in industry. Or even as a clinical trial coordinator if there was elements of that in your PhD. To break into the \u201cscientist\u201d position you probably would need a PhD, but some places may allow someone with a masters to work their way up (someone can correct me if I\u2019m wrong about this).",
