  "text": "I'm trying to focus on doing well my work and enjoying the experience. \n\nHowever, it's hard to see someone who in front of my boss appears \"collaborative\" and outside rolls her eyes, closes aggressively the doors in front of me, gives me a very weird stare and is taking credit for my ideas. I know this sounds childish, but its harmful when you want to do well in a healthy environment. \n\nI'm trying to be always with people when am with her, so in case she does something there are witnesses. Also really choosing to stay positive and enjoy my internship experience, I want to carry out a project that genuinely is aligned with my values. \n\nAre there strategies to keep me sane while this experience?",

A \"Hey I noticed (xyz example behavior) and I may be misinterpreting it, but is something wrong?\"\n\nEven better, in the moment. \"By your expression, it seems like you disagree. Let's talk about it.\" Etc. \"Let's talk about it,\" is also not a question. Express your desire for a positive, professional working relationship. You don't have to be friends, but do have to behave professionally. That won't fly in the \"real world.\"",
