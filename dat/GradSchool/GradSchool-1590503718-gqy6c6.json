  "title:": "Does anyone feel they are becoming lazy during their PhD?",
  "text": "I started my PhD right after my undergrad and am now half way through. I have been finding it increasingly difficult to work and feel motivated about my research. I keep using lazy \"work arounds\" to avoid having to read or code. I am not sure if I am showing signs of ADHD or if I just in the wrong field. I had these problems throughout my life but never to this extent. There are aspects of the project I enjoy and I do not want to let anyone down by quitting, but I feel like I will get \"found out\" and that I am just wasting my supervisors times as I do not belong in this level.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your advice and kind words! I have put together a timetable to try stick to some structure in my life. I have put regular breaks which are to be used for creative activity or exercise (some with a rule to be away from a screen completely). I hope it will help me to  keep on track. I have also reached out to a university mental health support app. I will continue to learn about impostor syndrome and the ideas you guys have mentioned. Thank you again and I hope this post has helped others feeling this way! ",

Unlike many of y\u2019all, I can technically still *do* my research, even the human subjects stuff (thanks social media), I just...don\u2019t. I remember February Me; I had 4 conferences lined up for the summer / fall, two of which were international, and I was happily working full time at my main job and burning the midnight oil for my research. Of course, I spent 10 years training myself to never work from home (and I\u2019d do all my evening work at local coffee shops / bars), which may not have been the best plan. That feels like another world right now, because now I\u2019m laying on the couch for 6+ hours a day eating cheez-its and watching trash-tier anime instead of doing readings. I just finished one of my 48-hour comp exams on my specialty area and I barely cracked the books to take notes. I\u2019ve been getting a solid 1-2 hours of work in on my day job (software eng) a day, much less grad school. I\u2019ve hit the wall to end all walls, and I *still* have to propose my diss. Halp.",

In my field it is suspected that about 70% of grad students struggle with mental health during grad school. Sometimes it's grad school induced, sometimes grad school triggers something that was always there. \n\nThe key thing is to GET HELP for yourself. Talk to your peers, or an understanding faculty member. You might not be as alone as you expect!",

      "text": "I echo everyone else in the thread that this is totally normal. I was doing very similar things around year 3. Project I want to do around the house? Ehh.. maybe I\u2019ll just show up at the lab at noon. Soccer game I want to watch? Why don\u2019t I just watch that from 3-5pm. Drink too much on a weeknight? Welp, maybe taking 20 minutes to feed cells is enough productivity for one day. \n\n\nImportantly, while everyone has their own vices and distractions, I think this is a somewhat natural cycle, and it\u2019s one of the things that makes a PhD different than any other degree. At the end of the day, you\u2019re only going to finish if you put in the work, and you\u2019re only going to put in the work if you motivate yourself to do so. \n\n\nI started to come to that realization around the end of year 3 / beginning of year 4 when I realized there was no way I wanted to be a 6+ year PhD student (though absolutely no offense meant to those whose path takes that long!), so working backwards from a goal of finishing in ~5 years, I realized I had to get to work because my experiments weren\u2019t going to do themselves. \n\n\nThis all my long winded way of saying, don\u2019t worry about it. Your motivation will come when you start to feel urgency, and that urgency will make you independent. You\u2019ll realize that you don\u2019t need a professor (or anyone else) to tell you what to get done on a given day or in a given week, your productivity will pick up tremendously, you\u2019ll graduate, and then you\u2019ll take this \u201csoft\u201d skill with you for the rest of your life.",

I don\u2019t think about work, or research, or anything else but what I\u2019m doing and exercise mindfulness. \n\nNot feeling like you belong? Like you\u2019re not doing enough to justify you being in your PhD program? That\u2019s Imposter syndrome. I think everyone who isn\u2019t completely full of themselves feels that way sometimes. We think we\u2019re just doing a really good job of keeping up a charade and hoping no one pays attention to the person behind the curtain.

That\u2019s not to say I never feel that way any more, but I can at least recognize when I\u2019m being unreasonable with myself or that I just need a break when I\u2019m not being productive. It sounds odd, a break when you just need to get something done, but guilting yourself only harms you.\n\nCounseling has helped me in this regard. Somehow, another person giving me \u201cpermission\u201d to not work and to take time for myself allowed me to do so, because I couldn\u2019t do it for myself. I\u2019m firmly of the opinion that while not everyone needs counseling, everyone can benefit.\n\nGood luck, and take care.\n\nOh, one last thing that helped me: mindfulness of the demands we place on ourselves. My counselor pointed out that, at my worst points, I used a lot of \u201cI have/need/should have [done] X\u201d. Stopping myself when I start to use that language, internally or talking with others, and force myself to rephrase (\u201cI want to get X done\u201d) or challenge myself (do I really *need* to do that, and do so *right now*?) helps with the guilt from not working. If it genuinely is something that is due immediately, I take a minute to center myself, then get to work and immediately take time for myself when I\u2019m done.",

Quarantine returned me to a level of lower anxiety that I thought I would never achieve again.

Our lab is reopening June 1st and I\u2019m sincerely mourning the loss of this time. It\u2019s making me question (more than usual) what I should do and if I should even be here. Because of this time, I think I want to work from home a majority of the time and I want a job that I don\u2019t have to think about once the work is done. I don\u2019t know if any jobs like that exist that will also allow me to afford to live AND pay off student loans. I think I\u2019m having an existential crisis. What is the point of anything?
