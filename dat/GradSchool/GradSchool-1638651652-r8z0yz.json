  "text": "I'm horrible at staying focused while researching/studying/working online (horrible! I'm on reddit right now!). \n\nI recently discovered the \"Forest\" app and I love it. I wanted to see if there are any other apps that people are using, similar or different, to assist with focus. I used a few pomodoro apps but I like Forest better since it actually 'covers' websites on your block list when you enable the chrome extension. \n\nI'm going to add reddit to my blocklist now:)\n\nWhat are the rest of you using?",

That way I can still access school sites but can't get onto reddit/facebook/tumblr whatever while I am working. I also watch study with me YouTube videos like StudyMD or Abao who have pomodoro timers built-in so that I feel like I am working with someone.",
