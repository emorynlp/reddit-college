  "text": "Grad school is tough. You work extremely long hours for minimal pay. It's a high stress environment and you can get kicked out, and along with that there can be a whole lot of isolation.   \n\n\nAll that takes a toll. I didn't realize how much it was taking a toll on me. A lot of my flaws worsened/heightened in that stressful environment, and I didn't realize how much I was rationalizing all that away. It took me going back to therapy again to gain proper perspective.   \n\n\nI'm a lot better now, but if I didn't have that realization I might have gotten worse. For anyone who is on the fence, I definitely say try it. Even though it's a time commitment, a clearer and less anxious mind makes working and doing research much easier too.",

Maybe you find another therapist, but give it 4 sessions. Most people suggest 10. It depends on the therapy form, but you need that time to feel comfortable with a stranger and they need to understand you before they can help encourage you.",

You won\u2019t connect with every therapist. Same goes for the therapy itself. There are many modalities of therapy and not all of them will click with you. It might seem obvious, but most therapy does not (and shouldn\u2019t) only involve venting about your problems. I say all of this because I often hear people say they \u201ctried therapy\u201d and it didn\u2019t work when it turns out they had a couple of sessions with a therapist that was a bad fit.",

Without the free counseling services at my uni, I wouldn't've been able to get therapy at all.\n\nBe assertive when you're finding a therapist about what your needs and preferences are - if you need/want someone who is open to talk about LGBT+ issues, or who has experience working with specific religions, if you prefer a specific sex for your therapist to make it less stressful for you, if there are therapy types that you prefer or can't do. Therapy is very much you get what you put into to it and shopping around makes it so much easier in the long run. Obviously some of those preferences you might not know right now and that's alright, but keep them in mind.\n\nAnd if a therapist ever ignores you that something they want you to do is physically painful or victim blames, they're probably not a good fit for anyone and you shouldn't feel bad at all for dropping them and looking elsewhere",

          "text": "If you have the means (financial and transportation), you may also want to try off-campus services. Each school is different, obviously, but I found my school's on-campus services to be extremely crisis-focused. I first went at the beginning of grad school when I did hit a very low mental state during the stress of adviser selection. By that time, I realized I was prone to bouts of anxiety/depression and once the initial crisis situation wasn'y there, the on-campus therapist basically just told me I needed to exercise. Left therapy and two years later when I got into another crisis situation, I was \"fortunate\" they couldn't see me for 3 months and recommended I see an off-campus therapist and it really was so much better.  \n\n\nTLDR: try campus services first, but you might end up benefitting if you are able to go to an off-campus therapist.",

              "text": "To add to this: I had a similar experience with my campus counseling (crisis-focused, not super helpful) but it was the easiest to get into bc it had an online reservation system and I could get in for an initial consult fast. I then basically used our sessions as an accountability device to get myself in with a long-term therapist. \n\nMy campus counselor de-mystified the process of getting a therapist, helped me make a shortlist of names in the area, and checked in with me to make sure I was calling. It really helped me. For someone who tends to make mountains out of molehills like me, having someone to handhold me through the process was really valuable.\n\nProbably not how you're supposed to be using counselor time, but well... it wasn't helpful otherwise.",
