  "text": "I am finishing this semester exhausted. I enrolled for 6 thesis credits and honestly have not done 6 credits worth of work so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen there. I\u2019ve just been so tired and unmotivated about my thesis. I think I\u2019m in over my head with it but I\u2019ve already gotten funding so I feel a little trapped. What if my research isn\u2019t good and it\u2019s all kind of wrong and bullshit? I\u2019m studying something I started off knowing nothing about and I\u2019ve read lots of literature, but now that it comes to deal with these things in real life I don\u2019t know if I can do it.",

He keeps saying he\u2019s not an expert but he is surely more experienced which is frustrating. He\u2019s very\u2026 moody. So I don\u2019t even feel comfortable asking him anymore after I\u2019ve expressed this concern several times.",

The question you have to ask yourself is not whether you already have a good footing in it, but whether it's interesting enough to you and commensurate enough with your already established skills to sustain your effort.",
