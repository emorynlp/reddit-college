  "text": "First year PhD student in Biology here. my program allows us to do lab rotations for the first year before committing to a lab. My first rotation didn't go super well so I'm pretty sure i will not join. The second rotation, however, is going amazing so far! The work is very translational and the lab environment is very nice. I get a long well with the PI and feel comfortable chatting with him about failed experiments or new research ideas. The only concern I have is that the PI's background is not exactly the right fit for the projects I am interested in. He is a chemist/structural biologist by training and I am interested in immunology/cancer applications of the technology that the lab develops. There is currently one postdoc (and one PhD student) who is in charge of the cancer biology side of the lab and they are planning to start applying for PI positions next year. So if I were to join the lab, the postdoc would only be around for 1.5 to 2 more years to train me. I know nothing about cancer or immunology and I am planning on taking classes but I think it is still quite risky to join a lab where the PI's expertise is not in the area I will be working on. There are collaborators but I have not chatted with them yet, so I am unsure how eager they are to helping other students. Oh and also, because the PI's expertise is more on the technology development/design side, he is definitely more interested in those projects, even though he is planning on keeping the cancer biology side of the lab running. I have also not seen any favoritism in my time here, and also talking to current students. what are y'all's thoughts?",
