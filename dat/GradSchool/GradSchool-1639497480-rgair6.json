  "title:": "Concerns about joining a lab - Bio Phd",
  "text": "First year PhD student in Biology here. my program allows us to do lab rotations for the first year before committing to a lab. My first rotation didn't go super well so I'm pretty sure i will not join. The second rotation, however, is going amazing so far! The work is very translational and the lab environment is very nice. I get a long well with the PI and feel comfortable chatting with him about failed experiments or new research ideas. The only concern I have is that the PI's background is not exactly the right fit for the projects I am interested in. He is a chemist/structural biologist by training and I am interested in immunology/cancer applications of the technology that the lab develops. There is currently one postdoc (and one PhD student) who is in charge of the cancer biology side of the lab and they are planning to start applying for PI positions next year. So if I were to join the lab, the postdoc would only be around for 1.5 to 2 more years to train me. I know nothing about cancer or immunology and I am planning on taking classes but I think it is still quite risky to join a lab where the PI's expertise is not in the area I will be working on. There are collaborators but I have not chatted with them yet, so I am unsure how eager they are to helping other students. Oh and also, because the PI's expertise is more on the technology development/design side, he is definitely more interested in those projects, even though he is planning on keeping the cancer biology side of the lab running. I have also not seen any favoritism in my time here, and also talking to current students. what are y'all's thoughts?",

          "text": "Sry I didn't elaborate; shortly before my first reply I just butted heads with my PI and obviously, for hierarchical reasons, lost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Go for the PI fit not the project.\n2. More on 1. Currently, your interest =/= PI's interest which means....at best case, your project takes off and your PI becomes a believer. Middle case--when your interests clash, you don't get it your way....most of the time, unless you bring funding yourself (hard to bring funding for your pay + project..that's like an R grant). Worst case--your PI's honeyd\\*\\*\\*ing you and will forbid you to pursue soon afterwards\n3. This is when it's handy to have former/current members to gauge a feel, but the lab is starting out (it seems)\n4. It's natural for Postdocs to plan to become PIs eventually, but 2 years out seems a bit early to plan....no? First the postdoc may want to write a K or something more before planning of heading out. I wonder why\n5. Humans change. PI's are humans. PI's change. While you may get along, tougher times where you'll butt heads are guaranteed. While alone it's fine, combined with 2, I'm not so sure. I left out the case for a change for the better, but that's an easy \"good\" point so I don't think I need to elaborate on that.\n\nJust a word of caution from another person in a small-ish lab. N=1 so PLEASE weigh others' opinions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest,",

              "text": "I second going for a PI fit over a project fit. You can have the most amazing project but it won't matter if your soul is repeatedly shredded and crushed by your PI. The PI can make or break your PhD. You will always run into problems with a project, more if you have a problem with the PI. You can also use other PIs, postdocs, and grad students in your department, other department, other institution as resources.",
