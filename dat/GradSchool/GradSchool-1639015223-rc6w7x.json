  "text": "Applying for grad school here. One question that seems to crop up often is what other schools I\u2019m applying to. Makes me really uncomfortable, since I\u2019m a weak candidate to begin with (zero intern or out-of-class research; 3.8-3.9 gpa on scale of 4.3, but that\u2019s it). How should I respond? Do I just be truthful?",
