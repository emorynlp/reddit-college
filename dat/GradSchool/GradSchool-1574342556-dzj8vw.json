  "text": "This is in the context of one grad student to another, but I\u2019m so tired of having conversations with people where they (condescendingly) end it with \u201cyeah I don\u2019t have time for that\u201d or some variation.\n\nMe: Yeah I\u2019ve been trying to read a fiction book a week to get myself enjoying reading again\nThem: Oh I WISH I had time for that\n\nThem: Last night I went dancing\nMe: Sounds like fun! I played video games all night\nThem: Yeah I don\u2019t have time for things like that \n\n\nIt feels like the implication in these conversations is that I somehow have more free time or less work to do than them (we are in the same courses with the same assistantships) and it\u2019s been getting on my nerves and fostering a dislike for some people in my cohort. I try to take it in stride but dang it\u2019s annoying.",

Not having time is also more of a psychological struggle than an actual lack of time; when I'm finally done with all the tasks that need to be done for the day, I'm too mentally exhausted to do that \"relaxing\" activities like reading a book or playing video games. When people say \"I don't have the time\", a lot of times they're simply feeling overwhelmed. It is more of a reflection of their own state of anxiety than a backhanded comment that you have too much free time. I hope someday, I will have the time, energy, and motivation to want to do \"fun\" things like reading fictions again.",

      "text": "I think mental illness makes it much harder though so it's important not to jump to conclusions. \n\nIf you're suffering from severe depression/anxiety (as many PhDs are), you're going to be *way* less productive with the same amount of time. 8 hours sitting in your office ends up being only 1-2 hours' worth of work, and so to get a solid amount done, you have to spend even more time sitting there. Then that feeds back into the cycle, makes you feel even worse, tanks your productivity even more, and suddenly you're spending *all* of your waking hours struggling to get nothing done at all. Suggesting that they should do *even less* work and instead use that time to read a book will seem almost insensitive, perhaps taunting. \"I don't have time for that\" achieves one key thing: it ends that conversation. You stop talking about how well you're handling your hobbies, family life, job, relaxation, heath, etc. \n\nThe lament of \"I don't have any time\" can easily be a complaint about how much someone is struggling to cope, just expressed in terms that are a bit more socially acceptable. What people often mean is \"adding more things into my schedule would overwhelm me right now\", but that's quite personal and they're not going to admit that to your face. Not everyone can juggle loads of activities and be constantly doing *things*.",

Some people's need to be competitive is annoying sometimes because it keeps you from having a real conversation because they assume you have some other agenda when sharing something.",

There are things that are important to me so I make time for them: working out, writing fiction, some TV shows. Not everyone would enjoy those things so they might spend their free time socializing, caring for a dog, playing video games, etc. Sometimes people who are already using their free time for something else who wish they had more time so they could add lower priority items to their schedule. (e.g. the dancing vs video games exchange you mentioned)\n\nOn the other hand, many people view having free time--or at least admitting to it--as a weakness. To those people I wish them well but that's not how I want to love my life, and in fact I think that is counterproductive to accomplishing the in depth, truly difficult work of academia, although very good for feeling busy and productive. This is a really good article about a similar issue in the intelligence community: https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2019/november/naval-intelligence-end-cult-busyness\n\nIn any case, I think the best thing to do is understand your priorities, the hours available to you, and to do what you need accordingly. And pay no heed to those who do differently. (Unless they're your boss, a more difficult circumstance.)",

It's easy to end up working late nights if you waste time during the day and procrastinate until deadlines. If you choose to hear their puffery that way, you'll find yourself reacting very differently.",

I first make a list of all the things I HAVE to do that day (from most important to least....usually from due soonest to not haha). I'm usually able to get one or two things done in that quiet hour. Then during office hours or class breaks or lunch I'll work on the rest of the list. By the time I get home I'm generally done and can work on any things on the list that are like \"optional activities\" (e.g. reading for fun, learning a language, knitting, etc.) I usually pick one or two a day to work on for a certain amount of time (e.g. I'll do 50 pts on duolingo a day, and read for an hour). I think it's just making the most of those in between times and really deliberately organizing a list of what's important and what isn't. If I have a lot going on sometimes I get so overwhelmed that I just can't do anything, so lists help.",

I'm not suggesting for a moment that grad school *doesn't* have the power to make the most confident person doubt themselves at times, but the constant wailing and gnashing of teeth about waking up and going about one's day AS A GRAD STUDENT (always, always dropping that into conversation, lest you forget) was just exhausting. And because I had a family, I was treated like a circus freak, someone who could not possibly be taking this as seriously as someone who GAVE UP HER WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS, OMG. Never mind the fact that I threw my entire family into financial upheaval to pursue this dream while McKenzie gets to skate by on daddy's trust fund. But the behavior was always rewarded. Those who complained the most bitterly were coddled by the faculty. Again, I know imposter syndrome is a thing, but the collective fragility of these adults is astounding. \n\nThose who didn't join in the chorus of misery were all but ignored. I just kept my head down, got my MA, and (so far, unsuccessfully) tried to head back to industry. The idea that if you're not miserable, you're not doing it right is what made me run screaming from a career in academia.",

I was in a weird place in that I was older than about half of our *faculty,* and not many of them knew what to make of an older student and graduate assistant occupying the same space as young men and women fresh out of undergrad. Some of them were afraid to give me work, while others seemed to take pleasure in giving me neverending shit-jobs just to see how much I'd take before speaking up\\*.\n\nAt the end of my program, I was singled out in a group invitation to a GA dinner party one of our brand-new faculty members offered to host. She said something snarky about making sure to leave the kids at home. It was common knowledge that I was the only GA with children. I mean, why assume I'd think it was okay to bring them in the first place, or that I'd even want to? And if that had been a genuine concern of hers, why not address me in private?\n\nI had been letting a lot of stuff slide and was just tired of it by that point, so I actually called her out\u2014professionally, mind you, but I made it clear that she had crossed a line and made me feel unwelcome in a department I had given so much time to. I received an apology and the event was moved to a different venue so I'd feel welcome (nope).\n\nIronically, this professor spends a great deal of time patting herself on the back for being so accepting of marginalized students. I don't tick off any of those boxes; therefore, it's totes OK to be an asshole to me.\n\n^(\\*I never had to. Another faculty member saw what was going on, and he stepped in and stopped her.)",

I was floored. \n\nI have also seen some students with children held to university standards that no children be allowed during working hours or class time - while others mysteriously got a pass and their kids were present with no faculty intervention.  \n\nPersonally, I would rather see a blanket statement that is uniformly applied. Any event or space is a family event or an adults-only event - just state it as a fact. I feel the same for a +1. I went to a Uni event and was the only one who brought a SO. I had no idea that was frowned upon at a research dinner. I mean really - just state the parameters.",

My dad and his friends, very much working class, do the same thing to each other.

Four years later I have two dozen publications and am on track to graduate below the average time, and I'm not saying this to toot my own horn, but because I *never* felt as busy as most of these people say they are *all the time*. If I can do all of that and not feel the need to constantly overwhelm my schedule and whine about it, there's absolutely no reason anyone should be doing so, either. I read books for fun.

But anybody who says \u2018I don\u2019t have time for any hobbies at all or I don\u2019t have any free time at all\u2019 is probably not using their time well.   Hobbies and free time help us to be happier and mentally healthier.  \n\nWe work to live, not live to work - a friend recently decided on \u2018life-work\u2019 balance rather than \u2018work-life\u2019 balance along the lines that life should come first. \n\nIn academia, those lines are often blurred between work and play, but it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t sacrifice other personal goals in the name of grad school.  \n\nI also think we all (myself included) spend too much time on social media.  I find myself endlessly scrolling through content I have seen before rather than getting up and playing a game or reading my book or studying my language (hobby).",

      "text": "I\u2019ve found that you can have time for anything you make time for. It\u2019s all about priorities. If people were being honest and accurate, they should be saying \u201cThat isn\u2019t a priority for me.\u201d \n\nI got married and had a baby in graduate school. I also passed both comps in the same semester, worked on grants consistently, taught multiple classes, published multiple quality publications, and I\u2019ve been very successful on the job market. And I still raised my daughter, worked out regularly, had time with friends, and watched at least 10 hours of tv per week. Because that\u2019s what I prioritized and made time for. Were there individual weeks here and there where I couldn\u2019t make time for fun things? Sure. But as a whole, I could generally make time for the things I prioritized most, as long as I de-prioritized other things. \n\nAnyone who is buried in work 24/7 and has no time at all probably isn\u2019t using their time wisely. I could spend 12 hours straight working on a paper, but I also know my quality of writing will suck after four hours. I could study for an exam for eight hours the night before, or I could study an hour per day for two weeks prior. People who never have any time are either shit at time management, they can\u2019t distinguish between important and unimportant tasks, they can\u2019t say no to projects, or they\u2019re genuinely being exploited (which does happen in grad school, but it generally happens to the whole cohort then). All of that reflects on them, not you.",
