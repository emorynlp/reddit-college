  "text": "Hi, so I was getting my teaching license through a post-grad undergraduate level licensure program, but I actually got a teaching job as an ESL teacher. Now I can no longer do the undergraduate program because it conflicts with my work schedule, so I need to do the job embedded masters program. I kept my current classes because I was doing really well in them, but now I've gotten overloaded and my quality of work for this one class has dropped a lot. To keep things short, the new job, studying for the Praxis II (teacher's licensure test) and studying for the GRE has taken up so much of my time that it would be a lot lighter of a load to drop this class, as it has a lot of time commitments outside of the classroom. This class is an education class, but the primary reason I would be dropping it is because it is taking up a lot of my time and it no longer goes towards my license. Still, would it look bad to withdraw from an education course considering I am literally in the process of applying for a master's program in education?",
