  "title:": "I mastered out because my PI told me she didn't think grad school was a good fit for me",
  "text": "I mastered out of my PhD in Cancer Biology in May of 2021. My PI told me in November of 2020 that she didn't think that I was \"getting it\". What I have gathered that she means by this is that sometimes after performing an experiment and interpreting the results, I would follow up with an experiment that doesn't necessarily help advance the project. My interpretation of that is that I have trouble sometimes designing experiments with all factors in mind as well as analyzing the data and carrying out next steps. It sounds like a lot of deficiencies when I phrase it that way I suppose, but I have little trouble learning techniques and advanced methods. I think I do an okay job of asking questions about journal articles and in lectures. I guess my question is if anyone knows of any ways that I could hone these skills that I feel could use some growth?",

Very high H index, speaks often, published hundreds of papers, the list goes on. \n\nAnyways, when I was able to spend time with time, constantly ask questions about his views on my experiments, ask how he was so successful (mainly perseverance according to him), it changed how I thought. \n\nTLDR: spend time with successful people, cliche I know but it works. \n\nBut regardless, it's not the end of the world if you stay mastered out. The opposite really. I have friends who never finished undergrad making high 6 figures working 30 hours a week because they went into the certain industries straight out of high school. They've already paid for their homes in cash before 30. Academia is very insular, making it seem like the biggest best thing out there until you manage to step outside of it.",

          "text": "That's a really good idea! Unfortunately, I am no longer there so I likely won't have the time to do so. I was hired into a position at the local branch of a very large pharmaceutical company. Unfortunately, that position doesn't challenge me as much as I would like. Most everything is automated which takes out the error but it also takes out the thinking aspect which is difficult when you came from a position where all you did was think day in and day out. \n\nWhat I maybe could do, branching off of that idea, is try to reach out to some folks on linkedin and see what they have to say? Maybe some from academia as well as industry? Bonus: If they like me and remember me, they could maybe consider me as a hiring candidate in the future and remember me as someone who wanted to improve on their skills",

Sounds like they really dropped the ball on their end I\u2019m not offering you the training you wanted and needed. Hope you can find some better professional mentors to help you move forward!",

I think she was good at identifying the problem but I had trouble implementing her advice for whatever reason. I suppose maybe we just didn't mesh well in terms of communication. \n\nI appreciate you saying that though because I do get down about it sometimes and think what could I have done differently? Why couldn't I \"get it\"? \n\nI hope so too!",

      "text": "I had a PI like that. Never supervised me, and I had to figure out everything on my own. Then they complained about me not doing things the way they wanted me to. Also there was a huge deal of abuse from their part. They never read what I wrote (never read my dissertation, either - so I was left on my own dealing with reviewers). I think it's better to get a PhD with a PI who truly supervises you. So now you  have the chance to look for a good supervisor who will teach you things, and be a stronger PhD candidate. Since you also have your MA's, there's no limits to where you can apply for PhD positions (usually outside of the USA, you are required to have completed your MA's to apply, or you should be close to completion). I know it mustn't feel great to master out when your aim was a PhD, but trust me, there's no use in useless PIs. They can truly ruin you.",

You need to be in a position to propose/conduct an experiment and interpret/troubleshoot the results, and do multiple cycles of this... eventually working independently to be at the PhD level. For some fields where experiments are cheap and fast, you might be better at learning from doing. You might consider moving into a field where cheap and fast experiments are more the norm.  \n\n\nStill, there are expectations of productivity and not just learning. You need to keep up with productivity expectations. Many less experienced students don't understand that.",

I suppose if I wasn't provided with the right guidance then I was just practicing without really advancing. \n\nI did struggle to be productive without the skills to interpret the data and determine the next steps appropriately rather than going a little bit off course or just repeating the same experiment. \n\nI wish there were some things I could practice at home. I am going to start reading journal articles again and hopefully I can soak up some industry knowledge and maybe I can look at the experimental design of those experiments. I don't feel like I gain as much by looking at a perfectly designed experiment rather than one that failed and determining next steps, but that is where I'm at right now I think",

Maybe your mentor wasn't helpful by either being too micromanaging or hands-off, and just expecting you to figure it out magically. Most of this kind of skill comes from group meetings and journal clubs where there is critical discussion of experiments and data. In some fields, there are public, Zoom journal clubs you can participate in.",

      "text": "To be honest, your PI sounds like my research advisor. I just left her lab because she was not supportive or communicating. Sure she\u2019d say things like \u201cI\u2019m here  to support you,\u201d and \u201cdo you have any questions? Let me know if you need help,\u201d but those were all empty words. When I asked genuine questions because I was unfamiliar with an assay or a topic, she\u2019d say \u201cwell look it up and you tell me.\u201d I get that independently researching answers is a big part of the scientific research process, but she was very negligent and dismissive and belittling. She was also very micromanaging in that she would literally list out things she wanted me to get done and tell me these were my to-do tasks, and then complain that I wasn\u2019t making my own independent contributions in advancing the project. I was getting very mixed signals and it heightened my anxiety through the roof. I even sincerely contemplated killing myself. I began to question myself at every step and questioning if research was right for me, so I did what I should\u2019ve done long ago and left her lab. \n\nAll this is to say that sometimes you find yourself in a rut, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into an end to your path. Maybe this specific group and advisor wasn\u2019t a good fit. Don\u2019t be afraid to try again if you think that you want to pursue research in academia. I\u2019m certainly not going to let one bad apple skew my perspective when it comes to viewing the entire bag of apples. It was so humbling and hurtful, but it also taught me a lot of lessons about who I am, with whom I\u2019d like to work, and what type of person I want to be. \n\nI hope I can encourage you my reminding you that you\u2019re not alone in having a bad research/mentor experience. We\u2019ll both get through it :) cheers",

Instead (unless you didn't mention all that mentoring she did) she told you that you weren't born a good scientist. Like, yeah Karen, no one is born a good scientist.",
