  "text": "Throughout the last couple of years living with friends, the biggest issues I've always had were people forgetting to do their chores or pay me back for bills. As much as I loved the guys I lived with they frustrated me sooo much because of these issues. I decided that I'm going to be proactive about it and channel my frustration into something productive. Because of all this, I spent the last 2 months building a roommate app from scratch. It's not much that I feel like it's pretty good so far. There is still some testing I have to do so I'm not launching it just yet. I'm going to launch it this Sunday. I'll add a link in the description on Sunday and create another post describing the app in more detail.\n\nI'll answer any questions you guys may have below.\n\nTL;DR - I had great but forgetful roommates for years, built an app to split chores and bills, releasing the app here on Sunday.\n\n**WeDivvy App Store URL -** [**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094)\n\n**WeDivvy Play Store URL** \\- Coming Soon",
