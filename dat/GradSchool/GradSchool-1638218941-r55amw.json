  "text": "so basically i'm a freshman in undergrad and my original plan was to do pre med so this semester i took gen chem 1. however, i changed my mind and am now majoring in psychology with a plan to go to grad school for it. i think i might have a bad grade in chem this semester like probably a c. will this look bad when i'm applying for grad school for psych if it isn't a requirement for my major, and if i explain that i just dropped pre med?",
