  "text": "I think I am broken. For as long as I can remember, I was a smart student but terrible at time management. I am in my first semester of grad school. I started grad school immediately after I finished undergrad. It took me about 5 years to get my 4-year degree (which I know is not unusual). At that time, I had to take a gap year because my mental health declined so badly. When I started school again, I had new energy and that was the only semester I got straight A's.\n\nNow, I am working on my final papers for my first semester of grad school. I have 4 papers due; two of which are overdue, and two due next week. I have barely started any of them. I am so overwhelmed. I am a perfectionist and I spend hours stressing out over assignments instead of doing them. My professor and therapist say, \"done is better than perfect\" so I am trying to follow that.\n\nHowever, every semester, I am in a similar situation. After it is over, I tell myself I will change; I will build better habits, but the next semester I am in the same situation.\n\nI am 23 years old and I don't think I can make it anywhere in life like this. I hate myself. I can barely make it out of bed. I like to escape by watching sitcoms and movies, but I know I have to live in the real world... I don't know what to do. Should I just drop out and get a job at Starbucks or something?\n\nI would love to hear some encouraging and/or realistic advice. Thank you :)",

      "text": "It sounds like you have some considerable anxiety surrounding assignments. I'm the same. Have you ever heard of the concept of [\"self-handicapping\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping)? It manifests in slightly different ways for different people, but in my case I become so worried that the things I produce (assignments, experiments, etc) are sub-par and will ultimately reflect poorly on me as a person. Somehow that translates into avoiding all work in order to not have to deal with those fears. \n\nIt can be incredibly hard to commit time and energy into something only to have it received poorly - AKA the entire graduate school experience.\n\nI don't necessarily have advice for you, but understanding it as a cognitive strategy to avoid mental anguish is useful by itself. Do your best to submit *something*. It will not be up to your standards, but it will be *complete*. You'll either find that the grade was better than you anticipated or - if not - you can decide what to do after. By not doing *anything* you're obviously setting yourself up for failure either way.",

      "text": "I am right there with you. \n\nI'm a grad student and for the first year in my program I had major anxiety over completing assignments. I would spend forever working on them because I wanted them to be perfect. I've always been an A student and put all my self-worth into my grades/education.\n\nI started working full time my second year (this year) and I realized I literally couldn't spend all day on assignments anymore and I started to just get them done. As hard as it was to do that I didn't really have a choice aaand I realized I still got the same grades as I would if I spent days or weeks. That was a huge eye-opener for me.\n\nThis has been challenging to overcome and still is, although it is getting easier. My therapist told me exactly what yours has - done is better than perfect. Whenever I sit down to work on an assignment I repeat that in my head. I will literally write in my planner \"Paper due - you got this, just get it done\" as a reminder to just start and get it done.\n\nLook into Parkinson's Law... the basic gist of it is that work expands to fill the time you have to complete it. Reading about it might help you in regards to getting started on your assignments. \n\nDon't give up, you absolutely got this! Also, remember there is no time frame in completing your degree. Take the time that you need for yourself. Everyone is on their own journey. These habits don't define you - you can do anything you put your mind to!",

      "text": "I am so sorry and I don't have advice but I want you to know you aren't alone and I could have written this word for word. Stay strong<3\n\nwait i lied i do have advice. or at least helpful words from my advisor when we had a heart-to-heart about this issue (elaborated on by me a bit). she said that people call grad school a balancing act but it's more like juggling. we all have different balls that we're trying to keep in the air, different assignments and our research and jobs and relationships and taking care of ourselves and all sorts of things. and often times, we end up throwing everything up in the air as high as we can so we can tend to one of those things. and gosh, it can be hard to make progress when we're worried about all of those balls we just threw up, because they start to fall. and then we rush to try and catch up on what we left in the air, but sometimes we drop those balls when they come back down. and you look around thinking everyone has this balancing act aced while all your balls are smashed on the ground. but we all have balls on the ground, and we just need to find the strength to pick them back up and start juggling again.\n\nthat is very longwinded and not eloquent at all (i am freaking out at the moment lol none of my balls are in the air and i think i dropped some on my toes), but i hope it helps a bit?",

You can\u2019t develop adhd - for the diagnostic criteria to be met you have to have shown behaviours as a child - but it can become really obvious when you try to do grad education. Might be worth a conversation with your psychiatrist?",
