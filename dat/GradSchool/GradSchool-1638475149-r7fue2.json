  "text": "I think I am broken. For as long as I can remember, I was a smart student but terrible at time management. I am in my first semester of grad school. I started grad school immediately after I finished undergrad. It took me about 5 years to get my 4-year degree (which I know is not unusual). At that time, I had to take a gap year because my mental health declined so badly. When I started school again, I had new energy and that was the only semester I got straight A's.\n\nNow, I am working on my final papers for my first semester of grad school. I have 4 papers due; two of which are overdue, and two due next week. I have barely started any of them. I am so overwhelmed. I am a perfectionist and I spend hours stressing out over assignments instead of doing them. My professor and therapist say, \"done is better than perfect\" so I am trying to follow that.\n\nHowever, every semester, I am in a similar situation. After it is over, I tell myself I will change; I will build better habits, but the next semester I am in the same situation.\n\nI am 23 years old and I don't think I can make it anywhere in life like this. I hate myself. I can barely make it out of bed. I like to escape by watching sitcoms and movies, but I know I have to live in the real world... I don't know what to do. Should I just drop out and get a job at Starbucks or something?\n\nI would love to hear some encouraging and/or realistic advice. Thank you :)",

      "text": "It sounds like you have some considerable anxiety surrounding assignments. I'm the same. Have you ever heard of the concept of [\"self-handicapping\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping)? It manifests in slightly different ways for different people, but in my case I become so worried that the things I produce (assignments, experiments, etc) are sub-par and will ultimately reflect poorly on me as a person. Somehow that translates into avoiding all work in order to not have to deal with those fears. \n\nIt can be incredibly hard to commit time and energy into something only to have it received poorly - AKA the entire graduate school experience.\n\nI don't necessarily have advice for you, but understanding it as a cognitive strategy to avoid mental anguish is useful by itself. Do your best to submit *something*. It will not be up to your standards, but it will be *complete*. You'll either find that the grade was better than you anticipated or - if not - you can decide what to do after. By not doing *anything* you're obviously setting yourself up for failure either way.",
