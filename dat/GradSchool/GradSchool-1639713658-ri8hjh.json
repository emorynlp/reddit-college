  "text": "(I have been advised to ask my question here. I\u2019ve asked in a couple other subs- just looking for some advice)\n\nHi all! I\u2019m hoping someone can give me some pointers. I plan on speaking with my advisors during my next semester, but all advising is closed for winter break. \n\nI will be graduating with my first Bachelors degree in Ecology and Evolutionary biology in May. Unfortunately, my most recent semester was not up to my usually standards and I\u2019m pretty disappointed in myself for dropping my gpa so low. \n\nSo my question is should I attempt to work for a while and retake some classes to get my gpa to a more competitive level to apply for a masters or PhD program? Or should I go for another bachelors degree, this time in chemistry, and make sure that I\u2019m competitive for a graduate program with that degree?\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading. Sorry if I rambled just a little! And any advice you have is very appreciated!",

      "text": "Depends on what you want to do but I generally recommend having a more advanced degree in 1 field. If you only had 1 bad sem that may not be an issue, my first 3 yrs had terrible GPA but my last yr made up (my grad chair told me he saw it as a sign of maturity). So maybe because of the pandemic the committee would consider that as well. Betting on a 2nd degree is riskier so personally I'd say just go for a MS since a PhD straight from BA is more competitive.",

      "text": "This likely depends on a lot of factors: (1) how competitive of a grad program do you want to apply to (2) how much will a masters vs bachelors cost (3) what would you like to do if you didn't make it into graduate school. \n\nLikely you can get into a lower tier or one yearish masters program with whatever GPA you have. If your GPA is really low then maybe graduate school isn't the best option. If you want to get into a very competitive PhD program the people in your field would have a better idea of what is better.",
