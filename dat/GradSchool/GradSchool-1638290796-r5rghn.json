  "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nI've lurked this sub for a while now. I love that this sub exists for all current, past and future graduate students. It has been helpful. I will not try to make this long, but I want to get some non-bias opinions here.\n\nCurrently, I am in my fifth semester in a Masters of Professional Counseling program. I have just a few semesters left. I have maintained a 3.8 for the entire program and love learning. I am approaching my practicum and internship placements next. However. I am absolutely burned out from this program, to the point where I genuinely do not want to do continue or even become a counselor. I know once I get my degree, there is a lot of extra steps you have to take to become licensed and that alone just overwhelms me. \n\nI work in the field, doing group stuff with kids and absolutely love it! It is one of the best jobs in the world but whenever I think about doing counseling, my heart simply is not in it. I don't know if the program just soured me on the profession because I love my job and what I do. It maybe some imposter syndrome but that simply does not comfort me because I don't know if I have any passion for this. \n\nThinking of doing one-on-one counseling terrifies and overwhelms me to the point where I just want to drop out. I don't know what to do.",

      "text": "Different situation but may be helpful... I have always wanted to go into higher education admin & had a ton of experience. I kept being told I'd never make a good administrator if I didn't have teaching experience, but the thought of teaching made me want to vomit. I preferred my students one on one... Well, I took a teaching job because I needed the experience. 6+ years in, almost done with my EdD in Higher Ed Admin & don't know if I'll ever use the degree & move into admin. I ADORE teaching & truly feel it's my calling now. You never know until you try, & you are SO close to being done! I say give it a shot then make your decision.",

      "text": "MSW turned public health here. Great post. You are asking yourself some important questions.\n\nI completed the MSW because I had a terrible under grad gpa (2.3) and needed a reset before actually attending a program I wanted to. Ended up working out and I did clinical work for a bit before getting crushed again and moving on. The MSW helped me get a foot in the door with public health. I know the professional counseling programs really aren\u2019t as flexible. But is it possible that you could reach your goal through the completion of the degree?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know many people who complete masters degrees who regret finishing. Some may have regretted starting the program but I know no one who said they wished they had stopped short and got those two semesters back. \nEveryone is terrified of their first individual counseling sessions. Everyone.\nBut it\u2019s not that hard. Reflective listening. Empathy. Ask the person what ideas they have. Applaud them for seeking help. Ask about suicidal ideations. Document. Staff in supervision. \nIn my first practice psycho social intake, my supervisor fell asleep, then asked me why I did such a shitty job. Was in the army so it was par for the course. Once got past that initial time, so much easier.\n\nGood luck. Be awesome",
