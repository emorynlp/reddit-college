  "title:": "Decided to take a leave of absence (LOA) from school",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI decided to take a LOA from my master's of social work program. Some context: I just graduated with my BSW this May after pushing through most of my undergrad. I was excited to finish school but was extremely burnt out from just \"going through the motions\" of school/life during my undergrad. I am *still* extremely burnt out from a social work-related job that I had quit back in *January*. During the summer I was considering deferring for a year and taking time to focus on myself because I was dealing with some mental health struggles after breaking up with my mentally abusive boyfriend of two years. I also wanted to defer because I wasn't sure if I *truly* wanted to pursue a career in social work. Despite my doubts and struggles, I decided it was just \"jitters\" and that I could push through (just as I had done the last three years of undergrad).\n\nA month into the program and I was having more doubts about whether social work was right for me and my mental health struggles only increased. I talked to people in the field, family, and friends, but ultimately, I \"spoke\" to myself. For once in my life, I have decided to trust my intuition and take a *break.*I'm not quite sure where life will take me, but I'm very excited. I feel happier, less stressed, and have just felt better overall after making my decision. I usually have everything planned out and try to stick to my plans regardless of whether it's still what I want. During undergrad, even when I was burnt out and having doubts about my next steps in social work, I didn't take a second to stop and ask myself, \"Is this what I *really* want?\", and I wish I had.\n\nAnyway, I'm just posting this because I want to tell people that it's okay to take a break, it's okay to ask yourself if this is what you really want. No, I'm not suggesting that you quit your programs, I'm just saying that it's okay if you decide to take a break and/or quit your programs. :) Thank you all for listening!",

I\u2019ve been thinking of cutting back on classes or taking a break for a bit, and it\u2019s really nice to be validated that it\u2019s ok. Thank you, and good luck!",

          "text": "Do what you think is best for you. Before I made my decision I sat down and weighed my options, looked through this sub, youtube, google, etc. I talked to professionals, friends, and family to gain different perspectives. Ultimately it was my decision. Take some time and see what you really want. I knew it was the right decision when I had a burst of energy thinking about all the options I had now, how endless my possibilities were, and how \u201cfree\u201d I felt. 99% of the time higher education does those exact things, it leads us on a better path (career and financial wise). It was ironic to me that after deciding to take a LOA/drop out, I felt like I had \u201cmore\u201d options than I would if I stayed, but I think a big part of it had to do with the fact that I don\u2019t know if social work is the career I truly want to pursue. That being said, do what\u2019s best for you, and good luck, I\u2019m here if you need anything!!",

I initially doubted my choice too and felt like it was a bad idea, but the more I thought about it and the more taking a LOA became a possibility, the happier I became.

I feel burnout now, but it\u2019s just from constantly being told no. I just got denied entry to the grad program at my school, and that was after a bunch of jobs also said the same thing. All that time and effort for nothing. I\u2019m looking at grad school somewhere else but goddamn, just tired of how things have been going.",
