If you buy Dell, they sell developer editions that come with Ubuntu preinstalled. System76 also gives the option to ship with Ubuntu. Stick with similar options to that. Windows has serious problems with rjava, and wsl doesn't resolve all of them",

      "text": "The right answer is going to depend just as much on ***how*** you want to run Ubuntu as which type of system is better suited for it.\n\nPC's with windows 10 or 11 have the windows subsystem for Linux built-in that will allow you to run Ubuntu in a fashion similar to any other program on the PC. While this works, I found in my experimentation that it introduces extra, unnecessary steps compared to running native Ubuntu (ex. I had to run a set of commands each time I accessed WSL/Ubuntu to make sure that x-windows was working properly for that session to ensure I could display the plots I was making) either via dual-boot or simply wiping windows and converting the PC to a Linux machine.\n\nWith a Mac, you have direct access to the terminal, and by enabling of a few \"developer options\" basically treat the system as a Linux machine. However, because of the recent switch to the M1 chip, you may run into some smaller or unmaintained programs/code that don't run natively on the system yet, in addition to the extra complication that comes from macOS being an implementation of BSD, not Linux. However, these issues are rapidly being solved given the large user-base within the academic and developer communities.\n\nUltimately based on how you've described your familiarity with Linux, I would dual-boot a PC if I were in your position; but I don't think you can really go wrong with whatever choice you make. It's just a matter of choosing which set of inconveniences won't bother you as much as the others.",

Time to use a cluster.\n\nYou can install Linux on the pc natively, not the case for the m1 mac (a dev branch is aiming to get it working but its early stage). \n\nThe M1 mac is in itself a Unix like system and has good support for data science workloads, mostly. Seek some reviews of the m1 in a data science context.\n\nTo complicate things, windows supports Linux as a core feature using its subsystem for Linux. You can install Ubuntu from the Windows store and use as if native. The major caveat being gpu acceleration for ds workloads is coming out in the next few months.\n\nAs for natively installing Linux on the PC. Go with pop os, it's Ubuntu based and has a ds install mode. You're used to Ubuntu, stick to the debian/Ubuntu family.",

Besides easier access to advanced configuration, it encourages (requires, TBH) learning how computers operate that can be fun and will probably pay off if you are going to make career in IT.\n\nFor me, it just has way less clutter than more \u2018user-friendly\u2019 distros. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to a stranger, though, and I won\u2019t recommend bare Arch to anyone, because installation without GUI sucks, IMO. I use EndeavourOS that is a nice fork of Arch.",
