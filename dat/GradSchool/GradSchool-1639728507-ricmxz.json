  "text": "I graduated with a 4.0 when I got my BA, and this is my first semester in grad school. I worked really hard this semester and I was hoping to continue my 4.0 GPA streak. I took a full course load and today my first final grade was posted... and it's a B. Is a B going to affect me going forward? I'm expecting A's in all of my other courses. \n\nWill a B affect my graduate school experience at all? Like with future jobs or research opportunities. Am I being too hard on myself for my first semester?",
