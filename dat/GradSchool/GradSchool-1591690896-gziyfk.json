  "text": "As a first gen student and POC, I always felt like my accomplishments and failures reflected upon my community. In undergrad, there were students that would credit my mere existence in the university due to Affirmative Action. It bothered me that all of my accomplishments were invalidated because of my race and gender. I was told by people around me that for you to be the best in your field you needed to dedicate every minute of your life to your academics. I believed this especially because I wanted to prove to people that I deserved to be there. I spent the summer and winter break during undergrad and grad school working in research labs. \n\nI intentionally missed out on family gathering and trips to my home country because I wanted to focus on school. Recently, my godfather died. He raised me. He has been sick for a while and I was not able to visit him in the winter because I was working on some new research. His death made me realize that I have missed out on so much. Things and events that I can't repeat. \n\nI was so overcome with the numbers game - getting into a top PhD program and publishing as much as I could that I ignored what really mattered to me (my family). I am aware that the next 5-6 years will be rough, but I am happy that I am realizing all of this now and not years into my PhD program. I am not perfect and it will take some time but I am learning to manage my time to prioritize my family members. I wouldn't even have the opportunity to pursue a PhD if my family did not support me.",

      "text": "Thank you so much for posting this, and I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nSomething similar happened to me around a year ago now, and I still feel very guilty. I am also a first gen and POC. I would spend all day and night working on school assignments and research. Even papers many other students would barely take time on, I felt I had to put in extra work to prove myself. All that time I put into school and work, I took away from being with my loved ones. Now one has passed away and I can't ever get that back.\n\nIt's been very difficult to cope, but I am now finally starting to feel better about myself. But it is definitely difficult balancing family and school/career. Now that I am trying to spend more time with family, I also feel guilty for continuing to pursue my studies. I deferred enrollment to a PhD program because of this guilt, I am not as motivated (or even happy) as I once was, and I keep questioning if this path is even right for me anymore. \n\nSome advice when starting your PhD, is to try to find a faculty mentor (or some other form of support) that might understand these difficulties. I am part of a fellowship program that supports minority students, and one faculty mentor has had similar difficulty with family balance. She has been a great person to open up to, AND I just recently learned she got a new position where she can be closer to family. Another faculty member has also helped a great amount. I just had to be honest and open up and she tried helping me look at my options realistically. I'm definitely not 100% anymore, but I'm grateful for these people who have helped. \n\nI think we need more people like you in academia and in research positions, those who understand these difficulties, to create a better space for future scholars and students from different backgrounds who can feel supported in their endeavors. Prior to beginning grad school, I asked many professors for tips on how I can prepare in the summer prior to grad school. Most told me \"spend time with family or do something fun. Because you won't be seeing them the next X years\". I took this very literally, thinking it would be irresponsible to spend time with family once grad school started. Not an OK mindset. As humans, I think we all work better (and are more happy!!) when we balance our time and spend time with those we love. \n\nCongrats so far on all of your accomplishments. And again, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure your godfather and family are very proud of you!!! Thank you so much for sharing this. It feels nice to know I am at least not alone. I wish you the best :)",

It's been 5 years since I last saw my family with 2 family members in stage 3 & 4 cancer. I was going to go back last month but then Covid hit. Devastating.

But the loneliness of being away from my family has worn on me a lot as I\u2019ve gotten older. I\u2019ve spent almost 10 years of my 27 years on this earth away from my family, almost entirely due to moving around the country to pursue academia. As great as it\u2019s been carving my own path, I have been missing out on gatherings, thanksgiving dinners, and this year I\u2019ll be missing Christmas. I\u2019ve basically decided this is the last straw, and once I finish this big project I\u2019ll be making an effort to see my family at least a few times a year before I wrap up this PhD and move home. Ideally I\u2019d like to stay there and wait it out until a job comes up, and if the pay is ok and it sounds fun I\u2019m willing to take whatever job as long as I can be close to family.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic definitely pushed this mentality. I can\u2019t fathom the thought of me being away from home and something happening to my aging parents or extended family. It\u2019s made me realize that even boring moments spent sitting around with my family are so valuable and important.",

Your story, as many others, remind that there needs to be a critical discussion about how academia conducts itself. \n\nWork/life balance is just a lip service in academia I find. Tenured profs go on and on about how we should enjoy life and not get caught up in long working hours, and the same profs pile you with contracts for their own research... I guess it's easier to create a work/life balance when you have assistants who bring you new ideas and syntheses.\n\nSo honestly I am not very optimistic about working conditions in academia, especially if you are not coming from a privileged background (I am also a POC immigrant with lower middle class bg). The question right now for me--similar to you perhaps-- is, do I want to invest so much time and energy on a journey that will frustrate me, or worse, turn me into a token without any genuine regard for my ideas and arguments. \n\nThis is becoming a rambling at this point, you touched a sore spot in me ;)\n\nBest of luck to you!",

I'm in chemistry, so work-life balance is a joke for us, and I wondered if my neglect of our friendship was to blame. I kept it inside and didn't tell anyone at lab except my supervisor (so I could take time off for her funeral). It took me a couple of days to tell my family, who knew her. All I can say is that there's no wrong way to mourn. What helped for me was talking openly with my close friends about it (we are a very tight knit group), and trying to do my best to let go of guilt and gain some closure. See a grief counselor if you have not already. There are going to be things that you feel you are socially obligated to do, just know that you are not required to comfort others in this time (unless it brings you peace of mind to do so).  \n For me, her suicide caused a much needed snap back to reality that put everything into perspective, and I realized that grad school isn't everything, and I don't give a flying fuck about academia. Sometimes I still dream that she's here, but the pain lessens over time as I focus more on the memories we had together in life.",

I think the key to success in academia is finding a good work-life balance. There doesn't have to be an incompatibility between research, publishing, and having a good family life with plenty of leisure. \n\nFor me, I work no more than 45 hours per week and usually stick to a 8-5 schedule except during grant season. I used to work many more in industry as a consultant. A lot of it is about being developing efficiency, breaking your work down to small pieces and checking it off throughout the day. If you're in the sciences as well, make sure you are collaborating to get your publications. My postdoc mentor (also another POC scientist) told me that you should be part of at least 3 seperate teams at any given point - and make small but meaningful contributions as co-author as much as you can. This advice has helped me get my numbers up (typically 10+ papers per year), and also offer opportunities to my co-authors in the 1-2 first author papers that I lead each year. \n\nYou definitely should take time off for vacation, but I think the idea that you would get the summer and winter breaks off might be unrealistic and you wouldn't expect that in any other industry. This might not apply to you, but for me, it's important to make specific plans with leisure to make sure it is high impact (scheduling dates with my partner, going to concerts, weekend trips, playing sports, ski trips, etc). The point for me is to make sure my time off can fully recharge me and make me feel like I'm not missing out in my social life.",

It went something like this: \"You cannot eat a Thanksgiving dinner with your research, with your career, or your papers\".\n\nIronically, research has proven that the most important thing for humans, are human connections and relations. You want to be successful, in order to share that success with your family and friends and provide them with a better life, true, but don't forget about them while you achieve your goals. \n\n\"*Imagine life as a game in which you are juggling some five balls in the air.\u00a0 They are* ***Work, Family, Health, friends and Spirit*** *and you\u2019re keeping all of these in the air.*\n\n*You will soon understand that* ***work*** *is a rubber ball.\u00a0 If you drop it, it will bounce back.\u00a0 But the other four Balls \u2013* ***Family, Health, Friends and Spirit***  *\u2013 are made of glass.\u00a0 If you drop one of these they will be irrevocably  scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged or even shattered.\u00a0 They will never be  the same.\u00a0 You must understand that and strive for it.\"* \n\nBruan Dyson, CEO of Coca-Cola Company 1986-1991",

          "text": "I don't know if it's glass lol, that's quite extreme. \n\nPersonally, I think the view on segregating parts if your life (like different balls, in this example) is sadly what modern society forces us to do, but I think needs to be continually thought about and tried to be reversed, to an extent. \n\nIt's hard to describe honestly, but for me spirit shouldn't be something that's juggled with the rest of your life. It's always there, and you need to find work, family, friends that feed into your spirit and heart full. \n\nSegregating spirit from all of these other things is just really hard, and is why I'm switching careers. When you're in a career that's completely opposite of your natural way of thinking, it really takes away from the richness of your life, at least for me. Finding a career that feeds your soul, and you don't just shut off on the wekeend, and is intuitive to your natural way of thinking,  and speaks to you personally is the biggest thing to find cohesiveness and completeness in all aspects of life. In my opinion, obviously this shit is all so subjective.",
