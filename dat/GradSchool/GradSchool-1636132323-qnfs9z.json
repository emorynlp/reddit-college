  "text": "Hi all, I am a current second-year master's student who made the decision to defer my Ph.D. applications by one year. It is completely heartbreaking, and I feel like such a failure. I know it is the best decision for me, but I am wondering a) if this is common and b) how I continue to do my own research without being affiliated with an academic institution. Any help is appreciated.",

      "text": "There's no reason to feel like a failure, TONS of people take time between masters and PhD. Sometimes a lot longer than a year. And it really depends on what type of research you do. Are you a wet lab person? That's probably going to be hard without affiliating with *some* type of research institution. Do you do theoretical with simulated data? Just keep doing it. It's impossible to know how to advise you with these details.",

      "text": "I don't think anyone really cares long term tbh, do something related or just work for a year - most grad school students I know took a year + off between, I personally took three years off and differed due to personal circumstances, but remained working in the field. You're worrying too much about nothing.",
