  "text": "So I\u2019m applying to two grad schools for next fall and the application deadline for the first school is approaching. Like, very quickly. Less than a week away. \n\nOf course, part of the application process is having two referees independently upload a recommendation. Pretty classic stuff here. I asked an old prof (with whom I did a research project and took 2 of his classes) and a lab prof (you know, a teacher for a lab class that can actually speak about my research and report writing abilities). \n\nGreat. Lab prof has already submitted his recommendation. But the other one? Not a word. I\u2019ve sent reminder emails. I\u2019ve emailed him directly. Not a peep. The last I heard from him was him saying he\u2019d write the damn letter. \n\nI\u2019m practically ripping my hair out at this point from stress. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to call his office and hopefully catch him, or else I\u2019ll leave a message. But what the hell else am I supposed to do? I\u2019m no longer enrolled so I have no way of knowing his office hours. I can\u2019t afford to just show up and spend a day waiting for him to go to his office\u2026 \n\nReaders, I\u2019m hashtag STRESSED. Please tell me some of you can relate or have survived similar situations.",

      "text": "I had a former mentor who reliably submitted recommendation letters in the last 4 hours of the deadline, regardless of how much lead time I gave him. Some people are just extremely deadline-driven.\n\nNow, by the time I applied to grad school he had written many letters for me, so I was never worried about him scrambling to write something good. I'm not sure if you're in the same situation or not, so I can't really comment on whether or not the stress is warranted...",
