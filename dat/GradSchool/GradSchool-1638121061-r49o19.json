      "text": "I am admittedly obsessed with decorating my office space. I keep the desk itself bare except for my monitor and a pencil cup, but I get a bookshelf that I've loaded up with stuff:\n\n\\-my rock/fossil collection\n\n\\-3D prints related to my work (most universities should have available 3D printers and if you're just paying for material its pretty cheap.)\n\n\\-a nice looking stacked file organizer for the separate sections I need to grade\n\n\\-several stuffed animals of extinct species like Smilodon and Tiktaalik\n\nI also have a few scientific posters like a geologic timeline. The walls are cinder block, so I had to use a combination of Commando strips and poster tacky.\n\nAll of my fun decorative stuff is at least tangentially related to my field, so it still feels somewhat professional. I am in a pretty casual field too though. I feel like nice looking office supplies (pencil cup, paper holder, etc.) and then one or two interesting pieces related to your work could help spruce things up without going overboard.",

      "text": "I had what probably would be perceived as a VERY childish desk in lab. Crocheted porg keychains hanging from my corkboard, plants with little animal figurines hiding in them (and I would freely tell people about them, particularly my favorite, Armin the Armadillo), and more. I never found that it impacted my credibility/perceived professionalism, but it would be very easy to just make the childish things little hidden gems and not have them all out in the open. \n\nUltimately, it's your desk. Make it a happy space and you'll feel better being there, and most people won't care at all. You might even have some nice conversations about things at your desk (had a great talk about axolotls with a tech because of all the stickers I have of them, lol).",

I've printed out and taped some funny science-related memes, a family picture, a drawing given to me by a student, and some random things. My labmate has farm and pet pics at her desk.\n\nI would honestly recommend, in order to bring life and a productive aesthetic to your workspace, to just make it personal. If that includes, like, pop culture items, so be it. Your pictures are your own, and a common desk item, and everyone likes plants. Additionally, you could have images of things related to your field, or professionals you admire, or cool conversation pieces (art, or a puzzle, or some perpetual motion machine, etc.).",
