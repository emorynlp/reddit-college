  "title:": "Is it a big deal to have a W on my transcript in Grad School?",
  "text": "I just started the first term of my Ph.D. program and am seriously dying. I signed up for a course that I had no business taking (a very math-y first-order optimization course) and now I am really regretting it. I honestly can't focus on anything else except this course and I am basically just barely able to half-answer some questions. The add-drop deadline passed 2 days ago and now if I were to withdraw, I would first have to double-check with my supervisor and then have a w on my transcript.\n\nOn one hand, I'd have to face my supervisor (who I already told that I was going to stick it out earlier in the term), and also I will have a W on my transcript. On the other hand, my quality of life has hit the floor; I can't sleep and have a permanent headache and can just feel the stress like a cold sweat all day long. I'm really trying in this course but it's affecting my other course and research to the point where I basically can't do them. I am doing all the readings and watching/taking notes for all the lectures but the course just isn't working for me. Are there long term implications to having a W on my transcript for getting a job in industry?",

      "text": "I did the same exact thing, I'm not worried about having a W. Worth it as I couldn't focus on anything else but that class at the time. I don't imagine they're going to not give you a job in industry all because of a W.\n\nHowever, I still found the class interesting and will actually be auditing it soon. I should have done that in the first place.",
