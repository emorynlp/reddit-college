I have a paper with multiple components that is due at midnight tonight and I have already gotten more extensions than I deserve so this is literally the last possible moment to do it and I just\u2026can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me (well I do\u2026adhd, reading specific LD, anxiety, depression, other health stuff causing fatigue, etc) but no matter how hard I try nothing is coming together. I\u2019ve been fluctuating between tiny bits of progress, complete and utter avoidance, and obsessively beating myself up for not being able to do this. \n\nI don\u2019t have much advice honestly, except to say you\u2019re not alone. Be kind to yourself. Grad school is fucking hard. \n\nSome things that have helped me:\n\nDictation (I use the otter.ai app) \u2014 Sometimes I\u2019ll just ramble to myself or pretend I\u2019m presenting on the topic and transcribe it. Do don\u2019t always end up with usable text, but sometimes the ideas come through enough that it gets the ball rolling and gives me some material to work with.\n\nBreak it up \u2014 if you don\u2019t already have your paper split up into sections with headings you might want to try, even if it doesn\u2019t end up like that in the end. This way you\u2019re writing 3-4 \u201cmini papers\u201d with intro and conclusion to tie them together and somehow to me at least that feels more approachable than one 20 pg. I know you said you\u2019ve already made an outline so try picking one of your points and start with just a paragraph on that. It\u2019s ok if you work out of order, it will all come together in the end. \n\nTalk it out - Call a friend and ask if you can just bounce ideas off of them. Explain your topic and thought process and let them ask questions. Alternatively, if you\u2019re comfortable, reach out to your professor. Something like \u201cThank you again for granting me an extension. I\u2019m working hard to get this done by the deadline but am really struggling with this one. Would you be available to help me sort though my ideas and figure this out?\u201d\n\nBack to basics \u2014 When you\u2019re really blocked, sometimes falling back on sentence templates like They Say/I Say (https://spscc.edu/sites/default/files/imce/students/LSS/Handout_They%20Say%20I%20Say%20templates%20all.pdf) or googling something like \u201ctransition words\u201d (https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/) can help when you just can\u2019t find the right way to say what you want to say. \n\nGet the small things out of the way \u2014 Do you need to add image captions? Charts/diagrams? Are all of your sources in Zotero (or whatever you use) already? A lot of the little housekeeping/formatting things that normally get left to the end still take time and need to get done. If writing paragraphs doesn\u2019t feel doable right now, start with one of those so you still make progress. \n\nOr course, all of these are easier said than done and I realize that I\u2019m in some ways avoiding my paper right now by writing all of that out. Time to go follow my own advice then. Hang in there, good luck, and don\u2019t forget to eat/hydrate!",

Not for me.\" Said by me during giving birth to my 3rd child and during writing my final paper.) \nJust sit down. One sentence at the time. You will get there. It's like the long steep uphill part of a hike when you don't want to anymore. Step by step and in the end, you finally reach the top. You need to do something with your time anyway. Might as well be awful writing. \nAnd remember. You can edit a bad page. But you can't do anything with a blank page. So just. Do. It.",

I had 2 papers to write and I was so done (one was 86 pages, the other was 27 pages). Don't give up. What I found worked was creating an outline. I'm not sure what your paper is about but write the intro last, do a background first, this could include definitions, history of the topic(s), etc. The discussion could be a few pages like a case study or two, and then recommendations for future research and conclusions. The first day or so I just found a bunch of journal articles about my topic and read them over briefly to get some ideas/direction. Also, just begin to write, don't judge yourself too hard! Keep everything you don't want to use in a separate word doc in case you go back and use it. I say try to write 2 pages a day... You'll be surprised by how much you may end up writing. Also, don't forget tables, figures, and of course pictures! In the end, a 20 page paper might only be 18 pages of words. Good luck!",
