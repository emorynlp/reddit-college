  "title:": "Advisor exploiting me for personal benefit and holding my degree as a leverage",
  "text": "I have been pursuing my masters in engineering degree from the past 3.5 years. My advisor has been intentionally delaying my proposal and defence. Last year he proposed that I convert my masters to PhD. I denied because of his oppressive behaviour and toxic environment in the lab. Now as I grew impatient and started pushing for my thesis defence he has started to bring up the unfinished works and put forward conditions. I am into robotics so I am talking about building robots. I have worked with around 5-6 robots already. Now he still wants me to make new one because he wants to earn money from that. However, I don't get stipend from lab and since my scholarship period has passed I have to pay semester fee as well. He has an angry and ruthless personality. Moreover he is a big guy in this university and holds a big position. I am in my 30s and I am feeling helpless. At the moment, while I'm typing this, I am planning to go to him and tell him that I'm leaving this program and I'm going home. Anyone has any advice?",

It might be easier than you think, since it looks to me that research-wise you are in a good spot. I assure you there are also resources in your University for these kinds of situations.\n\nYou definitely want to talk to someone outside of your bubble. Dean of Graduate Studies is definitely worth a shot. Is there anyone on your committee that you trust? I'd talk to them as well in private. Student Counseling Services might be worthwhile as well, but I would first aim at the academic \"levels\". At the very least, I would talk to *any* professor in your department that you trust. They will be able to guide you through this situation, or guide to the right resources.\n\nThe issue is that there are some formal benchmarks in place that you have to meet. If your supervisor is telling you that you are failing, or don't have enough to defend, the committee (not just him) need to come up with a proposal and a timeline on what exactly needs to be done for you to defend your Masters. The issue is that they can break these requirements without anyone actually knowing. \n\nI was in a similar situation and was so frustrated one day that I randomly walked into the Dean of Faculty's office and told him about my situation. The dean was fuming when I explained what was happening. They ended up explaining to me clearly that what my supervisor was doing was completely out of bounds, yet offered me a very tailored guidance on how to manage the situation with minimal damage (they also offered me the option of going to all out war, disciplining my supervisor, and getting me under a formal \"protection\", but explained to me that it's best we try the softer route first)\n\nIn short, please don't quit, and reach out to someone.",

The length of an MA is field dependent - I would say 4+ years is ridiculous but 2-3 yrs for an MA is not a red flag for every discipline.",

I would also see whether your university or department has a union and, if so, see what they can do for you if anything. \n\nToxic advisers and people who would intentionally interfere with a student's progress (i.e. future) in order to force them working in poverty are some of the reasons we need extremely robust protections for students, and extremely severe penalties for abusive faculty. IMO,  someone who exploits their students should be blacklisted from academia and be ineligible for hire at all academic institutions.",

Sit down and write out exactly what you have done, what the results are, a timeline of your work, why you meet the requirements for a MEng, why you do not need to do the extra work, anything you can think of. Organize it into a letter. If your advisor is saying you have enough work to switch to a PhD, then you almost certainly have enough for your masters.\n\nTalk to you ombudsman, the Associate Dean of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, and your graduate student union. Bring the above letter with you. For student union, they may provide legal help. It sounds like your advisor might be bending some school rules, having a lawyer explain that is not a bad idea here.\n\nAlso, you might want to check your school's mental health program. If your advisor's behaviour is causing you emotional distress/mental health issues, and you get a counsellor/therapist to verify this, it will make you case stronger (if you want to play that card). At the very least, you may be able to get a leave of absence, where you will still be a student and can fight your case without having to pay fees.",

Make a timeline and read the policy handbook of  the program in depth to make sure you are hitting all requirements. From there, discuss with the PI if he thinks this is a reasonable thesis. If he says no, ask him exactly what his issues are. See if there can be a compromise and also remind him about grad school policies. Take notes of every interaction. \n\nIf these things do not lead to a proper timeline for graduation, speak to someone you trust about \u2018advice\u2019. Ombudsment or committee member. The key here is to not appear angry, but come off as an \u2018excited grad student ready to graduate, but puzzled about details\u2019. I know. It\u2019s stupid. Hope my 2 cents helps in any way.",

Your advisor is abusing you, talk to your DGS and switch advisors solely to graduate. That is completely reasonable. If you don't want to do that, talk to your committee and tell them you are ready to graduate. Explain the situation to them. Then, if they don't step in, go to your DGS, your department head, your dean and explain the situation. You are not the first, nor last, person this has happened to and there are ways you can get out without giving them cheap/free labor. If they want your services after graduation, they can pay you a wage that is competitive for someone with a masters, not a grad student stipend.",
