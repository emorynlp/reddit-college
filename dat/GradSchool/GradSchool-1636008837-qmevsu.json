  "text": "So because I\u2019m in my college\u2019s undergraduate honors program I am writing a thesis this semester as if it were a master\u2019s thesis. However we\u2019ve had one semester to explore a topic, do a literary review, make a study, analyze and discuss it.  My major is nursing, so I decided to to a qualitative thesis about fatigue accumulated across 12 and 16 hour shifts compared to 8 hour shifts. The thing is it\u2019s an anonymous survey with likert scale questions and short answers. Not exactly the most internally/externally valid study. So in terms of usefulness in research its basically useless.\n\nOnce I group trends together using the data, should I just keep my conclusions brief and descriptive? Would a researcher even be interested in reading my thesis? If not I won\u2019t lose sleep over it, but if it may be worth something in the academic world then I\u2019ll write it as best as I can.",

      "text": "Exploratory studies like this get published all the time. I've attached a citation below on COVID stress and it used Likert and qualitative responses as you did (I think). If you do the stats analysis correctly and can support your findings, I don't see why someone won't want to read it. Additionally, I'm sure you've already done this, search your topic for existing literature and see if their methods are similar to yours, then copy the data analysis/stats methods.\n\nBarbosa-Leiker, C., Smith, C.

They are for you so that you learn, how to analyze data critically. So what will be graded is not the data itself, but how you are discussing it. If the data is not good then diskuss why and how it could be done better. Only for your PhD thesis you have to start worrying about how good the data is you have generated.\"\n\nMaybe this gives you back some confidence :)",

      "text": "I'm of the strong opinion that Bachelors and Masters theses should not be openly accessible (beyond perhaps your own university) precisely because they are a learning tool for a trainee researcher. You could argue the same for a PhD thesis even. Your thesis is probably going to suck. They all do at the undergraduate level because they are an undergraduate-level work. You *should* look back on it and cringe because it'll mean you've improved.\n\nNo one except your advisor (and maybe your parents) will ever skim-read it. If it's ever printed, it'll be shoved on some dusty shelf in a broom cupboard. It will never be read by academics in your field. It will never be cited. There may be some exceptions, especially for (actual) Masters theses, but your single-semester undergraduate thesis will not be that exception. It will never see the light of day, and that's how it ought to be. Use this as an opportunity to learn and free yourself of it. Be comforted by the fact that it will remain largely private. \n\nYou are only learning for the first time how to do research at all, or how to write a research report. It is not meant to be published or viewed by a wider audience. That would be very unfair to you.",

          "text": "Makes sense. It\u2019s probably a good sign that throughout the process of writing it, almost every chapter I think of all the ways I could improve it for real if I had the time/resources to do so. Like my introduction is solid, my literary review is meh, my methods suck, my analysis is gonna be simple, and my conclusions will probably be based on \u201clook at these graphs I told you so\u201d\n\nPreferably I would want to do an actual experimental study in which one group works 8 hours only, and another working 12 or 16 hours. Variables accounted  for such as everyone takes a week off so nobody is fatigued, workload, patients, and tasks stay the same, etc. then I\u2019d repeat it at several of the same type of facilities.  My results would use statistical analyses and I would point out significant data. Unfortunately this is impossible to do right now haha.",

Those things are more of an educational exercise than anything. Some researcher may find it, but those things are always taken with a spoonful of salt. If the former... well, if it really is useless it shouldn't get through peer review.",

Programs might request it as part of the application package, and at the very least you'd talk about it *a lot* in interviews. But, as you said, you're not. So even more reason not to treat this with more care than any other final exam.",
