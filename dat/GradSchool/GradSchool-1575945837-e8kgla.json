The problem is that so many journals disallow or at least dislike LaTeX (including even *Language*, which accepts LaTeX but doesn't seem to like it) - one of my undergrad professors switched to Word simply because she was tired of journals not accepting LaTeX.",

I 100% am not looking forward to it, though. And frankly it makes no sense--like you said, LaTeX is SO much easier for glossing, as well as for lambda calc (honestly I have no clue how to get half those symbols in word without copy-pasting directly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still type the bulk of my analysis in word, though, mostly for spell-checking purposes but also because it's easier to read for me for some reason. But yeah nope glossing \\*sucks\\* in word. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso-- if you haven't looked at Covington instead of gb4e, I can't recommend it highly enough. It's so much easier to use. Only problem is that it can't coexist with gb4e, so I haven't figured out how to add arrows back into my trees yet, lol.",
