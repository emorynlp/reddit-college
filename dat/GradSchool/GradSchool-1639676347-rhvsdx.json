  "text": "Hi guys! I'll try to keep this short and sweet, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm looking for advice on how to navigate a somewhat tricky academic career situation.  \n\n\nI'm 25, I graduated from college in the US in 2015 with a BA in a specific Comm field. I've since changed my career goals and want to pursue a specific type of medieval history. I'm applying to an  MA program overseas that does not require a BA in a related field, just a BA at all. While I do meet all the criteria on paper, the admissions page says they can sometimes reject qualified applicants for capacity reasons, so I'd say my odds of acceptance are 50/50.  \n\n\nThat said, I really want to attend this specific program due to where it is located and how it is structured. Similar domestic MA programs do require a BA in a related field, so I wouldn't qualify for them, which I've confirmed with the admissions departments of the schools with relevant programs.  \n\n\n So my plan is if I'm not accepted, to instead apply for a second bachelor's degree at a local school and then give the international Master's program another shot. I'll probably choose a different college than where I obtained my current degree, because it was quite expensive and I'm really just looking to crush this so I can pursue my true passion at a higher level. Does this sound possible or reasonable at all? I'm the first person in my family to really pursue higher education so I'm going in completely blind, I have virtually no one to turn to who can offer practical help.   \n\n\nAlso, if there's a more fitting sub for a post like this, please feel free to point me in the right direction! No offense taken, just stabbing in the dark a bit",

      "text": "I think that's an avenue but also a very expensive avenue.  I think broaden your horizon beyond that specific program and also look into networking in the actual academic field you're interested in pursuing.  I'm not in the arts, but I've seen graduate students selected based on just knowing the professors and expressing interest in the program.  As long as you hit the minimum qualifications those students get selected pretty easily.  \n\nIf you do decide to go and do a new BA, see if you can get some credits transferred or fulfill requirements from your previous degree.  My personal belief is that I'd advise you away from taking this route because it's just additional time wasted on another BA where I think you can probably find a different way into various MA programs you're interested in.  But it's also not my actual field of study so my experience and opinions may be incorrect.",

          "text": "Thanks for your input!\n\nIt definitely could end up being somewhat expensive but the good part is that the MA program I'm set on actually doesn't charge tuition due to the country it's located in. I've reached out to some of the emails listed on the University website but they aren't overly communicative. How would you suggest making contact or networking with professors in this way? I've definitely spoken with a couple of them but mostly just around the admission requirements.   \n\n\nThat said, I will definitely look into credit transfer as ideally I'd want to finish this second BA pretty quickly, in maybe two years without all the core stuff I've already done. I also would prefer not to do this, but because the other MA programs actually have a hard and fast requirement for a BA in a related field, they've pretty much told me that I cannot be accepted with my current degree.",

              "text": "1. If you're still in contact with former Professors or advisors, it doesn't hurt to ask if they know anyone in the program of your interest and are willing to help you network into it.   \n2. Most professors won't respond to cold emails.  They already get enough of these so unless they get a referral from a friend/someone else they already know (or another student who isn't asking them for anything but just advice), then it'll be hard to get a response.\n3. Conferences are the best at networking \n4. Honestly my brain is already a little fried from earlier today so I can't really think of any good networking opportunities so if anyone else has any good ideas to help you out then I'd **REALLY** appreciate it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding that second BA requirement.  Well...  I mean I guess that's a decision up to you.  if it's on the critical path for your future endeavors then ok.  But my gut feeling is that you can probably hit what you want out of life without a BA in it and they're just trying to be more \"selective\" and needed a stupid reason.  I'm sure they've accepted people without strictly adhering to these requirements.  I mean in one of my previous institutions we had a graduate student who had a BA in something else and our requirements were that you needed a BS as a minimum.  But that's again, just my own uninformed opinion so maybe.  My suggestion is to just apply anyways and try to give them 0 reasons to reject you (minus that requirement).  Who knows.",

I'll certainly do that!\n\nI may just cold email the program contact again and say, ask for some advice on further readings I can do on the subject to try and start a dialogue or spark some interest. I've spoken with one professor at length but again, just about admissions requirements and advice on them, so hopefully my name at least sticks as a person of interest. Thank you for your help!",

      "text": "Be sure to look at your prospects beyond graduate school as well. The topics sounds interesting, though, will it lead to a career working in the same field? See where alumni of the program end up.\n\nFor many people, graduate school can be taxing emotionally, financially, socially, and more. Please do check to see what you're getting in to. While the topic is interesting, the supportiveness of the department and particular advisor you have are critical in your graduate program.\n\nIt's often a long shot to hope on getting into the one school you want. Apply and see what happens, but be sure to have a backup as well.\n\nBest of luck as you figure this out!",

          "text": "Definitely agree. I held off on applying for a few years after my undergrad to ensure I was ready, and I have a few ideas about what I want to do with it. But i\u2019ve heard a lot about how taxing it can be so I hear you.\n\nI know it\u2019s definitely a long shot but in short, there is quite literaly no other opportunity in the world quite like this. The combination of location and curriculum is absolutely perfect for my goals so my plan B is basically to find a different way to gain admission later in life, by improving my experience and trying again. Thank you very much for your input though, I will definitely give some more though to what would happen if I am declined. Cheers!",
