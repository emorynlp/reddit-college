  "text": "I am a 26M grad student. My 27F roommate (also grad student) is leaving for the Spring and Summer semesters and wants to sublet her room, but the only person she has gotten is a sophomore (19F). She seems nice when I spoke to her, but I really have my reservations with living with a sophomore, 7 years younger than me. Has anyone here had experiences with living with younger undergrads when you\u2019re a grad student?",

      "text": "My first roommate was a sophomore. I was skeptical at first, also because I was moving to a different state, but she turned out to be very responsible, clean, organized, mature, and considerate. I wouldn't say we became friends, but we were definitely friendly and worked things out like adults. Because I was moving out of state, we talked for a bit before I signed the lease about what our expectations were so I was at least a little reassured. \n\nUnfortunately she moved a year later, and my next roommate was a \"working professional\" who was a total slob, a pot head, and lazy despite being 7 years older than her. \n\nAt the same time, I also think I got pretty lucky finding someone who actually wanted to concentrate on their studies and wasn't a big partier, so I don't know that my experience is typical.",

      "text": "I currently live with a first year undergrad student. She's pretty great - we barely ever see each other. I'm in the lab all day, and when I come home at night she's in her room studying. I had my worries at first, that she would be a partier, or annoying, but it's been good. Definitely interview your new roommate if you can. You'll get a feel of what she's like and then you can decide from there. But it can definitely go both ways - reading some of the other comments here, it seems like I got pretty lucky.",

      "text": "I have lived with undergrads during my masters and during my PhD. Both times ended horribly, one ended up involving lawyers and small claims court after my roommate threw a party and trashed the house, leaving us with thousands of dollars in damages. The other time was less bad, but my roommate was just super immature and irresponsible. I would absolutely never live with an undergrad again. Avoid it if you can.",

      "text": "I had a roommate who was an undergrad drop-out (I didn't know). She had no clue how to take care of herself or the house. Was the filthiest person I have ever met and couldn't do any \"Adult\" things (pay bills, handwash dishes, vote, order food, calculate tax, use a washing machine/dryer, use a tape measurer, drive, cook, use a vacuum or drill, etc.). I basically had to become like her mother and nag her. When she finally moved out, her room stank for months after. Never again.\n\nThat being said, when I was an undergrad, I had all of the skills that I have now and was an awesome roommate. I was clean, never partied, quiet, and courteous to my roommate and shared spaces. So I really think it depends on the person.\n\nIf she is really the only person that can take over the lease, perhaps you can write up a roommate agreement and meet her again to go over it and expectations?",
