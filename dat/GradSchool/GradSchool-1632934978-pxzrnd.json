          "text": "Motivation regarding grad school or just motivation for anything in general? As to the emotional bankruptcy, you feel empty or hollow? If so it is almost certainly related to your social well-being. Our emotions, motivation, and our perceived social well-being are strongly correlated reciprocally with one another. Our motivation essentially can be broken up into two general parts. Motivation in relation to positive monetary outcomes for yourself and your needs as an individual (homeostatic regulation)...and motivation in relation to achieving deep meaningful connections with other people. If you feel that this makes sense in that it fits with your situation, I would tell you to start looking for ways to connect with others, someone you can share your 'self' with. Either way mate, hang in there, stay strong, and know that it can get better, but you gotta make it better.",
