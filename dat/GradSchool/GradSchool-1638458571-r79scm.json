  "title:": "Should I get a job first or do a master's first",
  "text": " Hey guys,\n\nI am abit in a pickle right now, currently I am serving for one year in the army, and I basically can't do anything tech related -in terms of work or taking a degree- before June, now I am caught in two minds at the moment,\n\n1. Apply for a master's degree so that I can start studying it as soon as I finish my army recruitment\n2. Don't apply and look for a job instead and apply for the master's degree on the winter semester -which is around February or March if I can recall correctly-\n\nI am not sure which should I opt to, I know for a fact that I do need to get my IELTS down, and hopefully get a good grade aswell as maybe do a GRE aswell -which I have no idea about-\n\nI know I can do those things in 2 months if I set my mind to it but I am not sure which option is better for me, also a very important note is that if I do land a job it will probably be a frontend developer job while my master's degree would be a Data Science degree so my job won't really help alot when it comes to me studying for my degree, but it would maybe give me some way to finance my degree\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts, thanks!",
