  "title:": "Fully funded Ph.D. is no longer common in the US?",
  "text": "I was arguing with a guy who claims to be a professor in the US.\n\nHe said, from around 2013, the number of fully-funded Ph.D. programs started to decline, and nowadays, the statement \"many Ph.D. programs give you tuition waiver and stipend\" is no longer true, even in STEM.\n\nI was not really convinced, as I am a fully-funded student in STEM myself. So I pulled up these statistics.\n\n[https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22300/assets/data-tables/tables/nsf22300-tab035.pdf](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf22300/assets/data-tables/tables/nsf22300-tab035.pdf)\n\nAnd he said as follows: (Originally in another language, translated by Google and me)\n\n>This type of questionnaire is optional. As far as I know, more than 100,000 doctoral degrees in basic research and applied fields are issued every year in the United States, and if the average time to PhD completion is 6 years, and if we do not include dropouts, The number of Ph.D. candidates is about 100,000 \\* 6 = 600,000. The number of responses to this questionnaire is less than 49,000, so N is too small. In fact, this population is underestimated because about half of the dropouts before getting a PhD. The majority of graduate students does not answer, and it is common that lower graduate schools that are not accredited in their specialized fields do not offer scholarships, so I think they are not even included in the questionnaire.  \n>  \n>More importantly, this survey reports that it is the \"primary source of income.\" In short, it is reported that the income source that accounts for the largest proportion of various incomes, not 100%. This recognition is quite important.  \n>  \n>I feel that the equation of PhD = fully funded as a national trend is broken because colleagues at many well-known universities in the United States, as well as the universities I teach, show the same tendency. By the time I took a PhD, it was an unthinkable phenomenon at a well-known university, such as a self-funding PhD ...\n\nDo you guys think what he said is true? I am still not really convinced.",

              "text": "Same for my program if we graduate in the amount of time we're intended to take. Students who didn't make adequate progress had to rely on their PI's grant funding rather than have extra years of TA-ing paid for by the department. Our university did that to prevent problems later down the line with the number of students in a cohort being lower due to an older student not graduating on time. We also used to allow self-funded PhD students, but only in situations where someone was coming back to graduate school after already having a Masters in the same area, working in the field for a few years, and just needing the dissertation and a few extra classes. However, the program doesn't even allow that anymore because they've put a hard stop to any self-funded PhDs.\n\nEdit- to add, I was at an R1 university in a psych program that prepared us to become licensed psychologists.",

Nationally representative samples conducted by reputable public polling organizations don't even have sample sizes that large, and they make population-level inferences. \n\nThe point that half dropout before getting a PhD (???) doesn't matter, because those positions could also be funded. People drop out of PhD programs for all sorts of reasons, not just money. People who are fully funded can still decide getting a PhD is not the path they want, and plenty of fully funded PhD students get pushed out of academia due to toxicity in their departments. \n\nUnaccredited \"graduate schools\" do not count and should not be included. Nobody cares if you get a PhD from DeVry because it's not a real PhD. If you were doing a survey of medical doctors, you wouldn't survey angel therapists or crystal healers because they are not medical doctors. Why does he think unaccredited graduate schools should count?\n\nHonestly unless you know for a fact that this person is a real professor, and not simply someone claiming to be one online, I would seriously question their interpretation of that data.",
