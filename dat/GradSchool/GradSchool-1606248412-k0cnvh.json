Sure you can have peripheral references, but they are always going to be the main one, who can speak to your actual abilities, and the one that people will actually read/look at.   \n\nI think that you're putting way too much stock in the fundamental reasonableness of PIs.  Should you do that with the PI who threatens to get your husband deported if you don't come in on the weekends?  Should you do that with the PI who tells you that you're a bad mother and you should drop out or get an abortion so that you can stay home with the kids?  What about the PI who screams at you if they see you talking in the hall to a coworker instead of working?  Your future career, your visa, and your current livelihood depends on your PI.  \n\nComplain about it and the university might punish them, but probably with just a slap on the wrist.  You'll still be up shit creek without a paddle, without anything to show for the last (2? 3? 6?) years of your life.  \n\nI don't think that you understand how bad PIs can get.  Some PIs are reasonable, and good bosses.  Some are not.  \n\nLuckily my PI is largely reasonable, but I understand that when the system is cold things need to run.  So I will be in at 10:00 tonight, mounting a sample so that it has time to cure, and I will be in at 8:00 tomorrow morning for a meeting to start it in a coworker's system.  It evens out, because I also have weeks where I do pretty much nothing, but that is part of the deal.  You're a graduate student, you do the grunt work when no one else wants to be in.  It's an understood part of the deal.",

But, some of us have multi-month experiments going on that for our own benefit we need to maintain.

I was in a lab that went from being cut throat (literal fist fights over equipment use, people giving fake results for the group meetings because they didn't want to be scooped from within, writing all of their notes in a personal code, etc) to essentially cleaving in two, where one half of the group wasn't allowed to talk to the other by the staff scientist managing them. Thankfully my office mate thought it was incredibly stupid, but I had members of my group who I probably didn't speak to more than once a month.\n\nSunk costs haven't set in yet, so give serious thought.",

I also suspect it\u2019s a cultural thing, where unions are super polarizing in some people\u2019s home countries (lol tbh they\u2019re polarizing in the US too). \n\nI wanted to unionize SO BAD once our school said we wouldn\u2019t be receiving a paycheck from mid December to the end of January for our stipends (normally we get paid over breaks and they treat us like salaried employees instead). The school knew about this for a year and just told us \u201cwell, I mean with a months notice you should be able to budget well for the missing paychecks :)\u201d. We not getting paid less, it\u2019s just not in the reliable manner we\u2019ve been used to. Everyone around me was annoyed, but is hesitant to discuss unions.",

They can drop you as an individual and very likely replace you with someone else who will put up with whatever the bull shit is. \n\nWith unions, you're now on roughly 1:1 terms with the employer and that benefits each individual provided they're not the occasional outlier that is too spectacular for even the most evil employer to screw over.\n\nTo me the first situation seems much less free for the vast majority of people.",

Because people wouldn\u2019t vote for that to be their contract. Fees are 1-2%, raises are typically 40%. I can provide citations, if you\u2019d like to read more.\n\nEdit: Actually, happy to do so anyway.\n\nResearch shows that students at unionized schools have better relations with their mentors than those at non-unionized schools (Rogers, Eaton, & Voos, 2013), and have shown higher pay than their non-unionized peers (Hewitt, 2000).\n\nRogers: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001979391306600208\n\nHewitt: https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Graduate-Student-Employee-Collective-Bargaining-and-Hewitt/3f633217bea4b36e7fbd03b26d305eba76e9e224\n\nAnother of interest include a qualitative study on the power of graduate unions:\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0160449X17731877\n\nAlso the EPI on grad labor overall:\nhttps://www.epi.org/publication/graduate-student-employee-unions/\n\nAnd if we want to shift to things beyond just graduate unions, then this [short summary](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2020.03.009) seems to be particularly promising for our discussions (since your effort in talking about this was minimal, glad I found a minimal review paper).\n\nQuoting from it:\n\n>In comparison to their non-member colleagues, union members are more politically active, more politically knowledgeable, engage in more political discussions, and tend to lean to the left of the political sphere [30,31,32]. A decline in union density correlates with a decline in voter turnout [32\u0001], while boosts in unionization are related to higher turnout among lower-income groups in midterm elections [33] and turnout generally [30,33,34].\n\n>people who belong to unions report a higher life satisfaction than those who are not part of a union [38]. Finally, union members are more likely to give, and to give more, to charitable organizations than their non-unionized coworkers [39].\n\n/30.
