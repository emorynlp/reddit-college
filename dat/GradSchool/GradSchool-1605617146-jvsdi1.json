  "text": "I didn\u2019t go to a top undergraduate or graduate school. We had faculty members that were very well-known in our field but they limited their interaction with undergrads/grad students they weren\u2019t working with. I never even got the chance to be in the same room as them or receive a reply to an email. \n\nBut my PhD program is in the top ten and now I am in a position in which I can openly interact with all the faculty members. I feel like every time I talk to certain faculty members I freak out internally when I find out who they are and what they have accomplished.\n\nI would describe my reaction akin those that freak out (internally) when they meet celebrities. I recently went to a faculty members house for dinner and he introduced me to his advisor in grad school. I think I completely freaked out internally because I couldn\u2019t believe I was in the same room with the individual that discovered a sub-field that revolutionized my field.",

I am going to give our department some credit and say that they do pick candidates holistically. I say this based on my cohort members. I think one thing our department has stressed since the first day is that we all have strengths and weaknesses. UCSD gives you the benefit of the doubt. The faculty doesn\u2019t go solely by GPA and GRE. I \u2018ll say this is the case if you are not interested in methods. If methods is your primary or even secondary field, then your GRE math score and math/stats classes are weighted higher. \n\nThe faculty is amazing (as you know by experience). And you should definitely apply! There was a study done that concluded our department had the happiest students in the top 20 PhD programs for Political Science.",

We are depressingly rare in any white collar career, let alone academia, that\u2019s why you feel uncertain or vulnerable in your gratitude over your situation. The reality is if you come from a poor background, you recognize that this is a grand experience that is afforded to a lucky few.\n\nThis is opposed to people from more privileged backgrounds that more often seem bored or disappointed by their place in life, who occupy the majority of positions and so dictate the work culture. This work culture makes you feel uncertain of your gratitude and enthusiasm, and gradually you replace enthusiasm with outward expressions of boredom and overwork. The elite feel cognitive dissonance because they themselves can\u2019t ignore that the luxuries they are relatively afforded from society, do not correspond with their relative contributions to it, so they regularly compensate for it by creating an image of overwork. They hesitate to express gratitude over their life because it would only trigger deep and unaddressed feelings of guilt and shame. This is not shame they should personally own, but their inability to address the underlying issue of that shame, which is unfairness, prevents us from actually attacking the problem. Overwork enables you remove that sense of personal responsibility in addressing the fundamental injustices in our society (hey I\u2019m working my ass off, they should get a job, etc)\n\nWhereas you can be fully and outwardly happy about your successes, because your place in life is a direct product of efforts and decisions you have made, most of your colleagues are there because of the inertia of reality and family (I\u2019m not trying to be a dick, I\u2019m not judging anyone here). It is hard to separate what successes are due to your own merit as opposed to your starting position, so maintaining an illusion of overwork and lack of happiness allows you to keep this realization at bay.\n\nLuckily there\u2019s more of us than before, I would suggest looking around for colleagues and peers who come from a similar background or are at least equally appreciative of reality. The sort of things we desire and appreciate in life are very different, and it helps to see people with similar values in a similar situation to ground ourselves, rather than regressing towards the mean.",

What's good advice for most is not good advice for the rest, which sucks if you're not part of the most. Coming into this from the outside, the majority of the elite lifestyle, their behavior and language is geared around justifying their place in society. Just as the poor rationalize why they are poor because they are ashamed, the rich rationalize why they are rich because they are ashamed. I think the problem here isn't the emotion of shame, but that our current system makes us all deeply uncomfortable. Why do people, across different strata and backgrounds demonstrate behavior that indicates a shame about the social system they live in? My opinion is, not only are the poor deprived in the obvious ways we know, the rich are deprived of a fair society they can be proud of and approach with open eyes.\n\nPeople are mostly good (the wealthy included), and unfairness is toxic to the spirit. So much of what the rich do in life and how they understand things, all seems to revolve around protecting their minds from recognizing this unfairness or by justifying/rationalizing it. So while this understanding benefits them, if you're coming into this from the outside, it is not beneficial to you at all, instead, it only confuses you and further alienates you from your background. We, as Americans, need to allow a plurality of perspectives to interact in the public mind, and be okay with contradicting perspectives existing in the same sphere. Then, as the growing community of academic professionals from working-class and immigrant backgrounds, we need to further grow our own barely-developed understanding, and foster a new way of thinking about these things which benefits our values and human spirit. Not to impose on others, but to lay the groundwork for a parallel narrative, so that future people like us have something to relate to, rather than having to work from a perspective that doesn't benefit them.",

What people should feel bad about is willful ignorance, and using workaholic culture as a way to avoid reality. There are people in developing nations that would love to be homeless in ours, but that misses the point. We should not feel guilt and keep our heads down, we should do everything we can to slowly drive the system towards good.\n\nTo be frank, it is a privilege to have a crisis about careers and imposter syndrome when there are (an ever increasing amount of) people within your own nation that are doing all they can just to survive. It is ridiculous that anyone who has made it through all of the filters it takes to make it into grad school would feel like an imposter. The standards that American culture sets are **unobtainable by design**. We live in a culture distinguished amongst others for its boundless optimism, ignorance, egotism, and dissatisfaction. The single-minded and vain  pursuit of the exceptional has led to a devaluation of what is commonly valuable amongst people, just because it is common.\n\nWhen literally every individual in your society is supposed to pursue personal greatness over others, it\u2019s a recipe for an antisocial society. You\u2019re good enough and that\u2019s all that matters. Seriously, no one should give a fuck that they are not the greatest or most competent. Why do we care? So, you\u2019re lucky and don\u2019t really deserve your relative advantages over other people. Don\u2019t just wallow in that feeling or quiet it with overwork, use the great head start you have to benefit others! Comparing people constantly is shit and part of a shitty culture. I get that there are so few positions and opportunities offered to us, but that\u2019s just due to a misguided economy and government, that has nothing to do with our value as human beings. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t deserve to be there, it\u2019s that there are many others, who you have the empathy to see, that deserve to have a place as well.",

But I also realize it is the case for even for many professors.\n\nI had similar experiences of feeling like they are celebrities when I first joined my PhD program. I thought my advisor is the superstar (partly because I knew very little about my research topic). I still think that he is a bright person and a decent person! But as I was learning a lot and gaining expertise in my thesis research I realized that he is a human so he doesn't know everything like any other human beings. I do respect his accomplishments and his insights&knowledge that was very great to guide my entire PhD! But no need to put them on the pedestal. They are humans just like you.\n\nIt has been helpful for me to keep the perspectives to learn the things that I can learn from them (e.g thought process, or process that got them where they are) but also understand that **it probably took for them SO MUCH trials and errors or even extensive training**. Usually, the extensive efforts and trials&errors to get to accomplish the success rarely get publicized compared to the success itself.\n\nCongrats on your journey. I hope your PhD research is rewarding!",

One of the authors was either department or program chair, and the other from a different institution who flew in to guest lecture for a weekish. They set up an autograph session where you could get your textbook signed by both authors and it really felt like that existed just to stroke their ego.",

The current rockstars probably had the same interactions with the academic rockstars who were around when they were doing their grad work and as newly-minted assistant profs. For us academics these people are celebrities.\n\nI was fortunate in my master's program to have had two of these celebrities in my field and even sub-field. The bigger celebrity--probably one of the top 4 or 5 people writing on German military history in English--and I were even on a nick-name basis with one another. He was so enthusiastic about me, and not only offered to write as many LoRs as I requested, but to even call faculty members he knew personally. Told me I'm \"a damn good historian.\" Sadly, he passed away the day after my birthday last year.\n\nEven back when I was an undergrad, I would have lunch with several faculty members at least once a semester when all our schedules permitted. I even had several ask me if they could borrow books from my personal library, which I was happy to agree to--they always returned them ahead of time.",
