  "text": "What it says in the title. Due to my change of university and living situation after graduating (living on my own with a covid bubble at a large state university to living at home and going to a commuter school for my PhD), I\u2019ve found I\u2019ve had to greatly change how I study in order to succeed. How did you all find what works best for you?",

      "text": "The biggest change for me was going from to only studying because I had to, to studying because I actually *wanted* to learn. Undergrad felt like I was always chasing the best grades without actually appreciating what I was learning. Now, I\u2019m motivated to find gaps in stuff I don\u2019t know, seek out the newest studies in the field, and write notes and draw maps connecting all of these ideas together. I had zero interest in doing that in undergrad, but now that I\u2019m actually working towards one final goal, everything feels relevant and important to learn.",
