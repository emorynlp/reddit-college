  "text": "In a [recent discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/lqm4a3/do_you_actually_read_all_the_literature_youre/) about not fully reading every paper, a lot of people expressed relief at finding out they're not the only person who does that.\n\nI wonder how many of the other parts of imposter syndrome could melt away if we just talked about them like this.\n\nI'll get us started:\n\n> My sleep schedule varies widely and I sometimes do not get up until after 1 PM. I also sometimes multitask in meetings and seminars (especially if there\u2019s a PowerPoint presentation involved), forget about paperwork until after it is due, and sometimes if I\u2019m talking to someone and I mention a paper I read a while ago I\u2019m vague or I misremember details and get them wrong.\n>\n> I also procrastinate, don\u2019t know how to network, don\u2019t keep my LinkedIn updated, am not part of academic Twitter, am slow about checking and answering my email, and am afraid of admitting that I don\u2019t know something and asking for help because I think everyone else must already know it and I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I don\u2019t.\n\nOK, I've shown you mine... your turn! (Please?)\n\nOh, and one more confession: I am no longer a crappy grad student. I graduated last year and am now a crappy postdoc.",

I just jump straight to the discussion, 100% of the time. \n\n\u2022 I never bother to look at graphs or figures. \n\n\u2022 On Zoom University (I know grad school as no different currently bc I\u2019m in my first year) I often go to extracurricular colloquia, etc, but only to show my name. I turn my mic and camera off and often don\u2019t pay attention to the speaker. \n\n\u2022 I\u2019m in a weekly reading group with members of the department and my committee and fellow lab mates, and I almost never read the papers for the weekly discussion (but I guess it\u2019s bc I am busy with other stuff for classes, etc). I don\u2019t know if the others read every week or not. \n\nI think when we\u2019re returned to in-person classes, I will be more attentive in extracurricular meetings bc I won\u2019t have the ability to turn off a camera and fuck around on my phone. If I attend, I necessarily have to pay attention. \n\nIn undergrad I would stay up to the wee hours studying and I would read every article, every chapter, etc. Now, I choose sleep. I cook myself a real meal and I take the time to enjoy it. Sometimes I\u2019ll stay up until 2 AM, sure, but I\u2019m certainly not working until 2 AM even if I could be. I\u2019m on Reddit or something.\n\nOh, also, I am on academic twitter and it\u2019s a literal waste of time. So to the people here confessing that they aren\u2019t on academic twitter \u2014 don\u2019t feel like an imposter about this. I could have gone my whole life without ever reactivating my twitter, but my advisor suggest I create an academic account. \n\nI literally only go on Twitter to waste time when I\u2019ve circled through all other, better apps and networks. And everyone on academic twitter is performative and fake as hell. It actually irritates me.",

My professor said \"this is totally fine, you've actually put down some really solid work\" and that was super affirming.

So ... yeah, probably this is a lot more normal than it felt at the time because the program didn\u2019t seem to hold it against me at all.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve thought about the imposter syndrome thing too. I agree one part of the antidote is confession, but the other is being mindful of when and how you share the good stuff. Be especially mindful of not over sharing due to insecurity. It is a really natural instinct to feel people might judge you so you want to head them off with the impressive stuff, especially in the context of sharing the bad stuff, but the overall effect can be pretty harmful. So I have a personal rule to not mention things like program rank, gpa, past achievements, etc without a good reason.",

Thank you for starting this discussion.\n\nI'm an 'older' MSc student, 31f, and have an unrelated undergrad degree that I received a decade ago, and (almost) everyone is young and has experience in my cohort. I self-consciously flaunt that I'm 'older' sometimes because I'm afraid of seeming like I have nothing to offer since I have less experience or knowledge than everyone else. \n\nI will ignore emails if they aren't important. I'm sorry. \n\nHonestly, I'm eternally grateful for my PI who understands work/life balance and promotes taking the weekend off without electronics. However, I usually work about 8 hours, 6 days a week because I *always* feel behind in my research. I absolutely love what I do and could not work as hard if I didn't. \n\nI put so much pressure on myself because I want to be at least one of the best in my niche, but I want to do it without sacrificing who I am or what I value in life, and that is a *tall, tall order*. \n\nI have such intense standards for myself and it causes me so much stress, but I feel like I could never succeed or be really good without putting myself under that pressure, especially since my mental health issues make me feel like I'm trying 100x as hard to do things that are easy (or at least not so difficult) for other people. I feel like it's what I use to compensate and assuage myself. If I just try harder... if I can just be the best... the top... then, I can succeed! Just like everyone else! \n\n...and then that perfectionism caused me to NOT TURN IN work, and my grade dropped. I would rather hand in nothing than poorly done work. I actually told my professor that. She said sometimes you have to turn in what ya got. I know that's not good, and that you have to complete things to improve, and that they know it's not always going to be my best work, but man... it's so hard to let go... \n\nI have ADHD and anxiety, and so I always feel like I talk way too much. I feel like the freaking Teachers Pet in all my classes, and I feel like others hate me for it... I even hate me for it, sometimes...\n\nI just joined 'academic twitter' YESTERDAY because one of my professors said that is where it's at. My LinkedIn page has next to nothing. \n\nI spend HOURS on some papers with my giant whiteboards and markers just so I can understand concepts and contribute. \n\nI try to hard and I feel like it's never enough and that I stand out as this old, 'other'. \n\nI've struggled with identity my whole life, and I want to be known as a good research scientist and a great mentor and that means everything to me. So when I feel like I don't belong, when I feel like an imposter, I feel like I'm lost.\n\nDamn, I really need to detach my personal worth from my work..............",

      "text": "Confessions of an ADHD graduate student...\n\n>My sleep schedule is a bloody mess. I usually go to bed anywhere between 2-3 but on really rough nights it could be closer to 4. Depending on how my sleep went last night I may or may not get anything done the next day. \n\n>I do all my readings (I got downvoted to hell for suggesting this was a good idea in the other thread) but that happens despite any other issues. It's the thing I prioritize because it always means I'm ready to answer questions... even if I'm absolutely exhausted. \n\n>I probably work, at most, 4 to 6 hours a day. I avoid booking a meeting before 1100 because I will be irritable and not focused until the drugs kick in. I spend the mornings curled up around my cat waiting for the drugs to kick in so I can get something done. \n\n>I simply will not read emails on the weekends. I refuse. My brain can barely tolerate the 30ish hours of work that I do during the week. Anything more is simply a bridge too goddamned far. \n\n>The reason that I always have something to say on most topics is because I've probably hyperfixated on that at some point in time. My husband laughs at my constant curiosity but I literally can't help it. The internet has made it so that any unanswered question can usually be figured out relatively quickly... and I must know... NOW! Doesn't matter that the conversation moved on and it took me 15 minutes to find that tidbit of info... I MUST KNOW.\n\n>The ADHD makes my brain work weirdly fast. I jump between topics and ideas really rapidly. By the time my coworkers are just getting to step 2 I'm already on step 5. This is not a boon, I cannot explain how I got to step 5 but I intuitively know it makes sense to be there. Try explaining that in a paper... ugh. \n\nIronically, my boss is much the same way and I have a sneaking suspicion that he is an ADHD kid too. He just has that vibe and he has WAY too many tabs open for a normal. He also has areas of research that he exclusively pawns off to his grad students because he can't deal with them. He literally can't, if you ask him to look them over it will never get done. \n\nOh, and on a personal level, I can be unintentionally brisk if I am fixated on a problem. This means I tend to give the solution rather than care about the feelings of the person presenting the problem. This only seems to be a problem with people I think should have it figured out, my colleagues. I don't seem to have the same response to my students, for some reason. It takes some getting used to but my colleagues now use me as an unofficial \"Reviewer 2\" because I will be aggressive in my analysis of their work without taking into account their feelings.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about that last one. I've worked on it with my therapist but is still creeps in no matter how much I work on it. On the bright side, once people get used to me as \"academically aggressive\" they actually kind of like it. It's kind of nice to be appreciated by your teammates for something you personally worry is a flaw.",

I'm just kidding lol, my sleep schedule isn't something to be proud of. \n\nI also waste more than 1 day a week. Especially with lockdown, I'm having a lot of trouble working. My qualifying exam was originally scheduled for October 2020 and then January 2021 and now it's been postponed indefinitely. I'm seriously considering mastering out even though jobs that require PhDs are the most interesting to me because I'm really frustrated with how my university treats grad students, I've lost the drive to do my research, and I'm just tired all the god damn time. \n\nI don't feel like I fit in in my program because everybody else acts all serious all the time. Like they can't just be 20 somethings and have to be ~professional~ every waking moment and it's hard to make friends. I also don't feel like I fit in the city where I'm in school because it's *ultra* outdoorsy. I've given up dating here because I'm tired of being asked to hike up whole ass mountains on the first date. People act like it's weird to sit in my apartment and relax on the weekend instead of going and doing some outdoorsy activity. A lot of people act like where you live for a PhD doesn't matter, but I'd be lying if I said that wasn't a huge part of it. I went to NYC last year (pre lockdown) and cried on the plane ride back because I'm so tired of this tiny city.\n\nI really miss the passion I used to have for research, but what can I do? I've contacted a ton of therapists, but half didn't even respond and the other half had no openings. Yesterday I spent the whole day looking at jobs I could get in DC because my older brother and younger sister live there and it seems nice. But all the interesting ones were postdocs or research associate jobs so yeah :/\n\nThis just turned into a depression confessional lmao",

Whenever there's a conference, I go only for free food. I suck at networking. I only recently started making a LinkedIn profile and my resume. I watch Netflix a lot while writing so that I don't think about the loooong hours I'm working on my research.\n\nI work 6 hours a week and on days that I'm working, I usually get so tired that I don't even have the energy to do my research. I take 3 hour naps after I'm working. It's that mentally exhausting.... I used to cry a lot during my Masters because I had a really bad relationship with one of my supervisors.\n\nI absolutely SUCK at email etiquette. It's something I'm actively working on of course, but I hate it and I want to stop emailing anyone because any small 'etiquette' mistake you make will make you seem like a raging gorilla when that's not what you meant.\n\nI'm not in research to be the god of novelty.

They are most likely inflating how much they work, either to look good or because they don't really know how much they actively work. Meanwhile, you, as the time tracker, know *exactly* how many hours you actively work.\n\nI struggled with a TON of anxiety over this stuff last year. I also tracked my time and came up with a similar result to yours: about 4 hours a day. It honestly really fucked me up and I was convinced I was a lazy bastard who did not belong in a PhD programme. Then my psychologist pointed out that actively working 8 hours a day in these sorts of jobs is completely unrealistic and pretty much no one is actually doing it. When people say they are working 40-50 hours a week they are including all their coffee breaks, bathroom breaks, daydreaming, random chats with colleagues, scrolling through news sites and social media, etc. Remove all that and most people only average about 4-6 hours of active work a day.\n\nTL;DR Don't beat yourself up too much about the number of hours you work.

Kind of a typical student schedule where I was working in between classes, at night for a few hours if needed, on weekends, etc. I felt totally exhausted and busy all the time even though my total hours were low. Recently I switched to a scheduled work system where I work during very defined hours and not otherwise. OMG it is amazing. I\u2019m working more hours and I feel like I\u2019m working less.

I feel like I've reached my quota for extra curriculars with it alone, so I don't bother with any of that other stuff.",

It really helped me understand how to do good work, and part of that was actually not working 7 days a week anymore.

They can do with that information what they will, but hopefully THEY'LL actually be able to make a difference in the world or at least have a happy life. Money begets money. If I can get up there then maybe they can stay up there or go further. And life is crazy so maybe I'll do all of this and get hit by a truck the day I land a job at Google. But hey, gotta try. And all of that plan begins with the military, continues with undergrad and grad school, and ends with a killer savings plan and potentially entrepreneurship.\n\nI appreciate how other people go to grad school with other intentions and purposes.

Just want to say that spending quality time with your kids with an average middle-class income is likely to do them a lot more good than being \"rich kids\" who never get to see their dad. They won't be aware of the trauma that you had to go through as a kid and won't understand your reasons for not wanting \"free time with SO and family\".",

Kids don't have \"[episodic](https://memory.ucsf.edu/symptoms/memory)\" memories of their first 3-ish years of life, but it's a crucial time for development of social skills and [attachment styles](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774302/) (haha can you tell that my research area is neuroscience?). It's also going to be pretty tough on your fiance to take on the entirety of childcare, as this comment seems to imply. \n\nAt the risk of being extremely obnoxious with unsolicited advice, maybe it would help to consider what you are doing for your kids' benefit (e.g., giving them stable housing, good education, and emotional intimacy), vs. what you are doing for your own benefit (e.g., using career success to try to compensate for the bad experiences in your past).\n\nI've always wondered about the \"biological clock\" concern. The risks of decreased fertility or infant developmental problems don't begin to show up until the late 30's. Most of my female colleagues in my PhD program don't have a problem waiting until they have stable career to have kids.\n\n> If I had it my way, I would wait to have kids. \n\nI'm sorry about that. The decision of when to have kids should ideally be a 100% mutual agreement between the parents.",

My dad was shy around me since I was a girl, not a boy, and he would just ask my mom how I was doing instead of directly asking me. We never spoke a lot when I was growing up cause my dad and I are both shy introverts.

I go to bed around 10pm, even if I didn't get all the work done that I should have. \n\nIn my program, a healthy sleep schedule is like a badge of shame. It means you're not a *true martyr for the cause*. The only acceptable ways of spending time on yourself, according to my peers, are happy hours, going to the gym, *maybe* a hike on the weekend. According to my peers, it's shameful to watch netflix instead of going to the lab on the weekend. When you (inevitably) burn out, *then* it is acceptable to make a grand show of taking a week off to go visit family or whatever. \n\nI do not think that an arbitrary amount of \"progress\" on my arbitrary degree timeline is important enough to lose sleep or free time over. I simply do not care how long it takes me to graduate. I enjoy my program overall and don't see anything wrong with working slow, if it means I can have a normal life *and* a PhD. \n\nI think some of the people around me, who devote almost every waking hour into their grad program (not exaggerating, these people exist), must not have a strong sense of identity outside of their studies. I feel sorry for them.",

I definitely would not get good grades if I wasn't pushing myself this hard, and I really wish I was capable of doing well and having a more reasonable amount of time for myself. My program is competitive, and most of my classmates are coming from Ivies, science/technical backgrounds, and have loads of field experience... I have none of that. I didn't realize how math/programming-heavy my program would be going into it, so I have to go to every office hours and look like an idiot just to get a grasp on the material. But I also prioritize sleep over grades, and I try to do a little self care by devoting some time to hobbies during short breaks and light reading during meals. \n\nThis semester especially, I feel like getting everything in is better than pushing myself to get an A no matter the cost. I had lengthy hospitalizations in high school and undergrad because I'm so sensitive to sleep, and it feels like a slap in the face when people brag about pulling all nighters to get their work done or joke about it when for me, that would result in medical leave or worse.",

It's full of politics, competition to publish (because how can you have value as a human being if you've not published eleventy hundred papers) and fighting for funding. \n\nThe idea that's communicated if I don't want academia to rule every waking moment of my life is that I don't have what it takes to be in the research. I can pipette, quietly cry in the bathroom and repeat experiments until I feel like I'm losing my sanity, so how am I not cut out for research?\n\nI've seen one genuinely happy Prof who has healthy boundaries and a passion for their work as well as a life outside of the lab. The rest seem to exist solely in their academic bubbles and are excessively busy, overworked and 'carrying on' because you know that's \"just the way research is\". I don't want that.\n\nThanks for your honesty :)",
