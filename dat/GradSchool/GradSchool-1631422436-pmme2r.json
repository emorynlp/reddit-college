      "text": "The thing about applied math is that the application part of it is getting really, really easy - anyone with Google and Python/R can run a ML model in half an hour. The hard part is *interpeting* that model or how it\u2019s built - which requires a second skill set.\n\nYou can do good work with applied math, but a lot of people can use applied math *and* can model market behavior using human psychology with it/ model social-ecological systems / model spatial systems, etc.\n\nJust make sure you\u2019re not a one trick horse!",

              "text": "Well, I don't know about machine learning jobs, but I was able to find a job in an engineering field a month before completing grad school. I had grave concerns about my employability because I pretty much had a transcript of nothing but math classes and was scrambling to start learning programming and other skills, but it all worked out in the end. I suggest applying everywhere you can, even if the job listings want more experience or skills than you have. (Within reason, of course.)",
