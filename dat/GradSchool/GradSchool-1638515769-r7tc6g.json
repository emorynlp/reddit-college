  "title:": "PhD (computer architecture): US vs ETH vs KU Leuven",
  "text": "I'm applying to PhD these days in computer architecture in both US and Europe. This post is to assess the pros and cons and accept in case i get selected to more than one. \n\nTo clarify, I'm quite hard working myself and i enjoy working in my field, hoping to become a professor. I'm the kind who is fine with pulling occasional all nighters, but I'd prefer to stick to a 8-5 schedule, socialize in my free time and explore a lot as well. I prefer moving around in a packed campus, next to a vibrant & energetic city as that makes me feel alive. \n\n---\n\nUS universities seem too spread out, PhDs are longer (I'm sure they are wider too), no holidays, and not much to do apart from PhD itself. I'd love to live next to New York City, but both Columbia and NYU seems to pay not much. Travelling around the US seems like a chore though, even if i get the time. \n\nKU Leuven (Prof. Marian Verhelst's lab) built the impressive Envision processor, which is why I'm interested in their computer architecture team. It's also student city, so i expect things to be cheap, lot of fun things to do, everything close together in a bike ride's reach. Also i wish to explore Europe, so I'm thinking of using my 4 weeks holiday for that, from a central location. I expect a good diversity of students, and speaking in English is also a plus. \n\nETH Zurich seems good with modern architecture, more facilities and better overall reputation (prof. Luka Benini). But I'm afraid I'll feel a bit lonely there. Also I heard that while some profs are real slave drivers, Luca Benini is quite chill. Although ETH gives 5 weeks of holidays, I'm afraid if the workload would be too much.\n\nWhat do u think?",

          "text": "You are right, based on where I get accepted. I've shortlisted 12 universities in US, with good computer architecture teams, based on the literature survey I did for my paper. \n\nStanford, Berkeley, MIT, Harvard, UCSD, Georgia, UCSB, Michigan Ann Arbor. I'm just wondering about the application cost at this point.",
