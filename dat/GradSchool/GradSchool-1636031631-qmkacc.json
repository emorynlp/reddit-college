  "text": "I am a biotechnology graduate with a gap year during covid where I did a pg diploma in bioinformatics. I was accepted into University of Cologne for my Masters in Biological Sciences and am contemplating leaving the course after 3 weeks. It\u2019s mainly because of 3 reasons :\n1. My lack of motivation to study the subject. This past year has been extremely rough on me and I couldn\u2019t do a lot besides the diploma which was pretty easy because of online classes.\n2. I think I have lost interest in Biology in general and feel like moving towards the business and managerial aspects rather than stick to the research part.\n3. I literally cannot recall anything I did in undergrad. I am feeling so dumb and useless during the lectures and I feel like I can do something else with my life. \n4. I am figuring out a backup plan since I am an international student and a lot of money is involved. I have around a week to think it over.\nI am going through a major anxiety and depressive episode and feeling extremely lost. I never considered myself suicidal but I am feeling extremely negative about everything in life right now.\n\nI want some advice from the subReddit. I feel hopeless and fearful of everything. I have a supportive family but I also want to do something meaningful.",

      "text": "This is a great reason and time to leave. No sunk-cost fallacy because you really haven't sunk that much time into this. You will only kick yourself for staying with something you already know you don't like if you continue. Grad school doesn't get *more* enjoyable as you continue (this from a 4th year PhD candidate). If you already know you don't want to do this, and have something in mind you would rather be doing, GO DO THAT! This isn't a competition to see who can survive grad school, and frankly, grad school is super toxic. Don't stay in a toxic environment because you thought you might want to do something when now you know you don't.",

Your program *should* let you do this at the end of the semester, but they might try to push you out of the program because you are so new. If you think that you might want to come back, I would *really* advocate for leave instead of leaving the program entirely. It costs them nothing and makes it so you wouldn't have to reapply if you were to change your mind.",

      "text": "Someone more experienced please correct me if you disagree with what I've written here.\n\nI just started my PhD so don't expect accrued wisdom from me, but general advice I've been seeing is not to force yourself to work on a subject at this level. I can't imagine forcing myself doing that.\n\nAs a relevant anecdote, I did my undergrad in Physics which is a subject I really enjoy and would pursue it further from interest alone. Alas, I didn't want to base my career in a pure STEM field which brought me to a good compromise of going into energy engineering, which I love now! Was it a a great career choice? I hope so, but I know it's not optimal, and for a long time I considered branching into stats and finance or an economics MSc as a career starting alternative.\n\nBut as for my own opinion, I wouldn't force myself into a specialisation course in a subject that I wouldn't want to base my career on. Business/finance based courses at a masters level sound like great alternatives if you think you'll enjoy it, and look to me like good qualifications to have under your belt if you want to leave uni soon while not being constrained to a job market opened by your biotech degrees.\n\nAs for forgetting stuff from your undergrad, that's absolutely normal. The way I see it, after you learn the material well once, it leaves your working memory but makes it much easier to recollect/relearn when necessary.",

I'm sure that in a uni such as yours you should have someone to talk to about switching subjects. Do you have a personal tutor to talk to about your studies?",
