  "text": "This post is partially so I can ask for advice and partially ruminate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm about to start my final semester of my masters program, which requires the completion of my practicum. To get all the required hours, I have to get in about 8 hours each week until the end of the semester, which means that I'll either have to work 8 hours on one of my days off or 4 hours for both days i'm not at my job. I would just get in my hours after my shift, but we sometimes have unpredictable mandatory overtime, so I can't schedule during those times with my site supervisor.\n\nI'm not complaining since it's only three months, but I wanted to ask if anyone else has been in a similar situation and how they manageable it was to have only one or no days off. I won't lie and say that I'm not a little worried about being overwhelmed. Does anyone have any tips or advice?",

      "text": "I think it\u2019s complete bs that they expect students to do free work first of all. I have a whole year of practicums (10 hours in spring, 15 for summer) and one of the semesters I have to work 40 hours a week for free. I have two young kids not in childcare and we rely on my partners income which now has to be cut down bc of all this. How we plan to manage is taking out the max amount of loans offered to us- and we are very lucky his job is willing to be flexible w us. He had to get a new job bc his last one wasn\u2019t flexible w scheduling at all. I would let your job now ASAP what you expect to be working and see if they are willing to work w you- if they are not, you may need to look at other jobs. Another option is offering to make up the hours by working 4 10 hour days if that\u2019s available to you. \n\nSorry for all the stress this causes, I highly empathize :(",

My job pays really well and let's me do my schoolwork on the job (I'm in an all online course) so Ill have to stick with it for now. It is BS, and I'm so sorry you're in that situation! You're incredible for going through grad school with two children, and I sincerely hope it all works out for you!",
