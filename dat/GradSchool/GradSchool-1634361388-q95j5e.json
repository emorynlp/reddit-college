I really resented having to work on group projects as an assignment in grad school.\n\nI especially resented having to write papers together (obviously as an assignment, not research) as a grad student. This was clearly just the instructor's end run around having to grade as many papers. There was no benefit to us at all. If it's not research, how does one write a paper together, anyway?",

The lecturer set a group presentation and invited people to form groups. Sadly I was off ill so wasn\u2019t there to be claimed by friends (who, incidentally, thought I\u2019d left the course). Cue me being assigned to someone on a different degree course with no idea who she was.\n\nTried multiple times to get in contact with her, met with no reply, so I got on with the presentation myself. Sent another frantic e-mail to her the day of the presentation, beseeching her to at least meet me in the library so we could run through the slides. She rocks up 15 minutes before the presentation to merge slides, no hint of remorse. I\u2019d gone for standard slides, black text with white background. She\u2019d gone for a pink and black patterned background and WordArt. I was speechless but left it as was so at least the lecturer could see that I didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. In the end, we got a decent grade, but good grief, what an experience. \n\nGroup work: don\u2019t do it, kids.",

The logistics were hard because some professors couldn't use Google docs (not kidding, they didn't know HOW TO USE GOOGLE DOCS) so we had to email around copies of MS word documents and make edits using these copies passed around but that's not the best part. It was like a group of 40 professors across Universities and I kid you not I have met high school students smarter than some of the professors in the group.\n\nThe paper was published and is generating a lot citations but that was a holistic learning experience regarding academia.",

      "text": "I had a group project where I was assigned to the group, we agree on a meeting location/time and I show up a few minutes early to the location to discuss our work.\n\nI don't see anyone else in my group.\n\nI wait a few minutes after the agreed meeting time and text/email the others to check in where they are. Half an hour after our agreed meeting time and me asking \"I don't see you guys, where are you\" I get no responses.\n\nLater that evening, I get an email from the professor that I'm not doing any of the work and the professor gives me a long, condescending rant about how I don't care about the coursework, how I need to take this seriously if I value my grade (I was doing fine in the class?) and forces me to set up a meeting to discuss my performance. My group members apparently reported me and had the nerve to show up to this meeting and say  \"he's not doing any of the work and I'm frustrated by it.\"\n\nImmediately they say this, I show them evidence showing that I prepared research for the group project and that I contacted them all via text and their email the moment I didn't see them and didn't get any response and they still tried to suggest I could have faked them. Sucks that that course was a waste of time anyway, but was required for my program.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've had professors, administrators, or coworkers say some of the most condescending, shitty things during my time in academia and the thinly veiled racism you deal with so often makes it exhausting.",
