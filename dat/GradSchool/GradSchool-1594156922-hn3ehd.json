  "text": "I've been reading various discussions on different subreddits about the recent ICE directive, and one thing that's been a constant theme is how there are so many misconceptions about how PhD programs work - A lot of people seem to think that a PhD is effectively an extra few years of college etc, and the whole concept of stipends, and research credits etc seem to be virtually unknown. Maybe this is also why there are widespread misconceptions about scientific results etc? Perhaps there ought to be more movies/TV shows that take place within the context of academia that dispel some of these notions (Sort of like what the West Wing was for politics), which may also be useful for grad student problems etc to be taken more seriously.",

It\u2019s grossly over exaggerated to make it interesting. Unfortunately, I think research and academia is boring to the general public. There\u2019s no way to make it glamorous that I can think of. \n\nPersonally, I didn\u2019t understand how a PhD worked until my now advisor sat me down to talk about it. I was *shocked* when I found out that I didn\u2019t have to pay for anything!! I listen to a handful of science and tech podcasts that I think could benefit from some episodes and interviews on careers in research, academia, etc. Something like how Darknet Diaries does a good job at shedding light some uncommon and really cool jobs in cyber security and how you can get them. I would really like to see someone use their platform to explain just *how* research is published, how predatory journals can publish bogus research, and how some of academic jargon works, so the public can kind of grasp our research and not be as scared.",

Even the counselors at the university mental health services assume that we are mostly taking classes and getting vacation in the summer like undergrads.\n\nHowever, with that said, I don't think the new ICE directives against international students have much to do with PhD programs in particular. The main drive behind it is that a portion of the US population feels that \"foreigners\" are invading the US and stealing jobs and education spots from them. They feel that that's why the country is suffering from economic downturn and why quality of life has decreased for some populations over the past decades. Those foreigners are less human than \"''Muricans\" and need to know their place. The antagonism is not just directed at students, but also towards workers, immigrants in general, and to a large extent also to people who are brown/black/non-white in the US.",

I think part of it's because there are no general discussions about grad school etc outside of people in grad school. I think that's where pop culture representations would help (As opposed to when the 'smart' character on every show claims to have 5 PhDs in different fields at the age of 20). \n\n> The main drive behind it is that a portion of the US population feels that \"foreigners\" are invading the US and stealing jobs and education spots from them.\n\nI agree with you. I was an international student who luckily just graduated (I'm married to an American spouse, so I'm not *yet* affected by any of the executive orders etc). I know a number of other people like me who've experienced patronizing attitudes and racism, stemming directly from this mentality.",

Me and my sister are both in PhD programs and two of my five cousins have masters (one is only 16, so who knows what she'll do).\n\nOn my dad's side, my dad is the first one to go to college, and even though he, two of his three siblings, and my grandma all eventually got bachelors, my dad is the only one with a masters. Half of my cousins didn't go to college. \n\nI don't have to explain anything on my mom's side. They all ask about my exams, am I ABD yet, etc. etc. I am incredibly lucky and privileged to have had a really good understanding of how a PhD program worked before starting. The family on my dad's side is totally baffled and they really have no idea what my sister and I are doing or how we can be in school for so long. \n\nThis ban is definitely not going after PhD programs in particular. If anything I feel like the last visa ban was more specifically targeted at researchers. Even my white European roommate has met some pushback here for being a foreigner in the US, and she is from the same country as the First Lady!
