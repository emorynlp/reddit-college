  "text": "I haven't been in grad school long but I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back next semester. I need to get some life experience (and a paycheck) and I'm just not sure what I want anymore. All I know is that I feel like school isn't the path for me right now.\n\nMy classes end in about a month and I have a ton of long and tedious work to finish. But since I know I'm not coming back, I'm curious if I should bother. I know there's the aspect of 'you might come back eventually, do it now so you don't have to redo anything later' but I'm still having trouble finding the will. Grad school has been difficult for me in many ways.\n\nI'm not trying to sound whiny, I'm just overwhelmed and sort of wiped out (as I'm sure we all are). I'm curious to get some different opinions.  \n\nThanks in advance. :)",

      "text": "I haven't been in your situation but I imagine it's super overwhelming, like regardless of whichever decision you make. All I'll say is that if you have capacity, finish the semester. If you do come back (to the same university and program), you'll have already done one semester's worth of classes. That'll save you future time and money from having to take for the same classes again.\n\nIf you don't have capacity, I wouldn't force yourself to do the assignments (even if it means you'll have to start from scratch later on). I have a tendency to be very considerate to my future self and not care so much about me in the present but that can go south real quick.\n\nBest of luck, hope you find the best thing for you!",

      "text": "I would try to finish the assignments with at least your minimum available level of effort. Getting a perfect grade on the final assignment is less important than passing the class. Especially if you already have a decent grade in the course from earlier assignments to buffer a lower grade here. \n\nPlus you already paid for the classes, might as well earn the credits. I\u2019m sure it feels super daunting right now, but it\u2019s almost done, and then if you do eventually come back to it you\u2019ll be more confident in your ability to succeed.",
