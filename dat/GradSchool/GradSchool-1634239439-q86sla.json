  "text": "I don't know what to do. I've experienced a tragic event this week. I should not talk about it online because it's a subject of active criminal investigation.\n\nI don't know how to handle this in the middle of the semester. I can't focus on my classes. I told my PI what is happening and she is very supportive. I have been excused from PhD stuff this week like meetings and whatnot. She said I should tell my teachers but I don't know what to tell them or even what I need from them. I'm in shock still. It seems to get worse at the reality of the event soaks into my brain.\n\nI couldn't participate at all today in a class that requires participation. I just couldn't get my thoughts together enough. I can't stop either crying or just... sitting there staring off into space. I thought I should email my teacher after class to tell them why I didn't participate but I don't know what to say. I don't feel like I can do the simplest tasks and suddenly everything is incredibly overwhelming. I didn't go to any classes this week until today and now I can't face catching up on lectures.\n\nI know the advice is to talk to my school's mental health services but I just... don't want to. I just don't want to. I have no idea what to do.\n\nIf anyone has advice, please tell me. I don't know what to do.",

This has been quite a shock and I am currently unable to focus on my PhD coursework. I plan to continue with my PhD, but I need some time to get my bearings. My PI is aware of the situation. Can you please let me know what sort of accomodations are available to me? \n\nThank you on advance.\n\nXXXX\n\n \nObviously you don't have to use this word for word (but you can). If someone died, just tell them a close family member or friend died. \n\nYou are in shock. Crying and staring into space are normal. Needing to step back when a traumatic event happened is normal. Sending hugs your way.",

      "text": "You've experienced a traumatic life event. It seems impossibly huge and overwhelming.\n\nThat's ok. That's completely normal for the situation. Allow yourself some grace.\n\nWhat's happening might \"derail\" the next month, or the semester, of grad school. That's ok too. In the long path that will be your career, that time isn't going to matter. It sounds like your PI is being accommodating, which is great. You can figure out what the way forward looks like, assuming you're not thinking about dropping out entirely (which is also a fine and valid choice, but obviously the plan and who is involved will look much different).\n\nStart by taking some time off. Talk with friends and family you trust. Zone out to a TV show you like. Do an activity you enjoy. Order your favorite take out dishes. Find a way to best take care of yourself right now. \n\nWhen you're ready--or close to ready-- find a therapist. The school's counseling services is the easiest way to do this. They may also be able to connect you with therapists outside your school. Having someone else can help you process the event, help it seem not quite so overwhelming, and can help you figure out what actions to take.\n\nI had a tragic life event affect me when I was in grad school too (criminal case and everything). I did some weird things and had even weirder thoughts when I was trying to process it. I think I took a whole week off before I called university services to even start getting things together.\n\nYou can find your way forward, in your own time.",

Figure out when the drop deadline is, or what happens if you drop it late. You should be able to get information from whoever runs your program about what your options are, and any issues that may arise from dropping it. There is no shame in dropping a class, especially one that requires a lot of energy and focus you just don't have right now.\n\nIf you're not sure if you're going to drop, ask the professor about makeup work and if you can turn in some assignments late. Someone above provided a great email template for reaching out. Get the information you need to make the decision.\n\nIf you chose not to drop, make full use of office hours to get additional help. Not all professors are great with this kind of stuff, but many genuinely love to teach and will help you learn the material if you show up and put the work in.",

Like another comment said, drop deadlines should be available, but know that most universities have a system to drop later in the term too - so even if it's after the drop deadline do not stress. Also, depending on how much time you'd like, universities typically have various leave programs specifically designed for if a student needs a temporary pause without losing their standing/spot in the program. If you have an academic or graduate group coordinator, I encourage reach out to them, you can use one of the email templates from another comment. It is literally their job is to help students navigate university things, let them advocate for you and guide you through any processes or paperwork.\n\nAlso, sending you support and encouragement. My father died during my PhD, so although I don't know exactly what you're going through I do empathize with life really messing with our grad school plans. I also know there are resources to help and that you can still graduate and succeed in the face of tragedy. Please feel free to DM if you'd like, and know that no matter what I'll be rooting for you.",

They are just glad that I am back. A lot of things went into my decision to take a leave of absence, but one thing I think may be relevant here: I am a consumer and I am paying for a product. I didn't think that I was in a space to get what I wanted to out of the program, so I chose to pause until I thought I would be better able to participate/learn/build relationships with colleagues. Lots of people take time off for lots of reasons. It's ok to take that time and come back. I do wish I was on track to graduate with my original cohort, but that's not the most important thing in my life.",

The instructor is very kind for offering me this level of flexibility so I can stay, but to be honest he's not a very good teacher so the class is a struggle.\n\nEveryone has different ways of dealing with stuff, and I feel good about my path forward.

Consider all of your options and make a choice that works for you. \n\nI also know that you may not love the idea of therapy, but I would really suggest you try to find a therapist that works for you. It doesn't have to be all feely, lovey dovey shit. It can be whatever works to make you comfortable. Ultimately a therapist's job is to give you tools to get to a healthy place. That can look like whatever you need it to. \n\nI would also make absolutely sure that your health insurance doesn't cover outside therapy. Oftentimes universities will tell you that you should (have to) go to university mental health services but your insurance covers therapy elsewhere. If you want, I am happy to check the insurance for you if you feel comfortable to DM the university you go to, since that can be a really taxing task when you are suffering.

I\u2019m glad your advisor is being supportive. \n\nI can understand your hesitance to reach out to professors and explain. It sucks to keep talking about it, and you don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll react. \n\nI think you may need some sort of leave or accommodations for health reasons. After having dealt with trauma myself, I realized that getting help from an expert on dealing with it is just as important as seeing a doctor if I break a bone. Mental healthcare is healthcare. \n\nI can also understand not wanting to reach out to your school\u2019s mental health services. First of all, that\u2019s a hard call to make. Sometimes it\u2019s the hardest part of getting into counseling, it\u2019s just so daunting to pick up the phone. I do think you need support here, though, so we should figure out how to get you some in a way that you are comfortable with. You don\u2019t necessarily need to even really talk much, but you should get the ball rolling on any potential accommodations. Accommodations feel like annoying paperwork, but they are there to offer you protection. \n\nDoes the counseling center have an email address you feel more comfortable using? Do you want a friend to walk you to the center in person, or sit on the phone with you while you call? I\u2019m happy to be on the phone if it makes things easier for you, just PM me and we will set up a time. I realize I\u2019m an internet stranger, but I don\u2019t want you to feel alone in this. \n\nDo you have a primary care doctor you could ask for documentation for accommodations? Does your insurance cover mental healthcare, so you can try to find someone who you feel is a good fit for you?\n\nIf you think that path is difficult or you don\u2019t know how to navigate it, I would reach out to your school\u2019s ombuds and ask what your options are. They\u2019re generally confidential and impartial, and there to advise you of your options rather than take direct action. I have had good experiences with the ombuds I\u2019ve spoken to. \n\nI\u2019m no pro at this stuff and I can\u2019t promise anything, but if you want someone to help you look into your options, let me know. It can be overwhelming, especially when you\u2019re already dealing with a life tragedy. \n\nThe next little bit of life will be taking things one step at a time. That\u2019s okay and to be expected. Be kind to yourself and give yourself permission to process it all.",

              "text": "I have spoken to plenty of people who struggle with talk therapy. You are right that you absolutely have to find someone you feel comfortable talking to, and that can be challenging. Sometimes these centers have websites with little bios about the counselors, and you can see if there's someone you might feel comfortable with. If not, I get it. If you decide to give it a try, you can always start off with acknowledging that it is really tough for you to talk to someone you don't know. A good therapist will make you feel more comfortable. \n\nI guess I could share my experience on this, and I hope it helps a bit: I hadn't really given therapy a try until there was a traumatic, mental health-related event in my family. I'm a scientist, and I thought, I rely on experts for information all the time, I need to talk to an expert about this. I went in and really was looking to talk about what experts understand about what had happened. And that's what the therapist talked to me about, because I needed that to start coping. However, she also started to offer advice on coping mechanisms, helping me with difficult decisions related to the situation, and just listening and offering minimal input. It took me awhile to realize how much support it gave me. I know everyone's experience is different, but I figured I'd thrown mine out there. At first I was asking questions more than talking about the situation or my feelings.\n\nIf you know you can't make the call but you want help finding email addresses, that offer is also on the table. I am happy to offer support if it makes this easier for you. I'm also happy to listen if you need to vent. \n\nThe ombuds or ombudsman (different institutions use different terms) is a neutral, confidential office that you can go to when you have an issue and you want to talk about what options are available to you. If you're not sure what accommodations you could request and that's a route you're interested in, I'd give them a call and ask. They typically can't do anything beyond that, so they're not going to start that process for you, they'll just guide you through what you can do. All the ombuds I've talked to have been very nice and genuinely want to help you figure out what solutions may be available to you.\n\nI do like the sample email from another user, that is well laid out.",

I'm really glad you found support in professional therapy. It would be nice if I could too.\n\nThanks for telling me about the ombuds, I'll look into it. Honestly wish I could vent but there is court to worry about! I'm nervous that anything I type on reddit could be used in court. Probably not worth the risk.",

If an incomplete in your courses is not something you are willing to do, or think you would end up piling too much on your plate later on, you could consider a leave of absence rather than dropping out altogether. I don't think anyone would question why you'd need a leave of absence, and it could give you an extended time to process what you are going through while still securing your place in the program. If it gets to that point, I would have conversations about a leave of absence rather than withdrawing because, I assume, the processes and consequences are different depending on what a student decides.",

I did, nonetheless, battle waves of grief that would wash over me in class, while studying, or on the way to and from campus. \n\nI was also driven to push forward because my son was so proud of my academic progress and used to call me \"Future Doctor Mom\", so persevering as a sort of memorial to him helped give me purpose.\n\nMy coping mechanisms may not work for you, and if you need to take a break from your program there is nothing wrong with that at all.

      "text": "I've been through a traumatic experience myself. I was mugged and assaulted, and very recently too. I thought that was the end of my PhD. Constant panic attacks, was always on the edge of tears, had many crying bouts, extreme nausea and loss of appetite. I had to smoke a ton of weed just to feel normal. \n\nBut now 3 weeks later, I feel more stable. The anxiety attacks have reduced. This is not the end of your PhD. Time will heal everything. In the meantime, just ask for accomodation from all your class professors. Don't guilt yourself about being unproductive. A couple of weeks, even a month off is nothing in the long span of a PhD. \n\nIf your campus has a counselor's office or if you're already seeing a therapist visit them. Ask them for more frequent sessions while you get through this.  sharing this experience with friends and family helped me get rid of the guilt and eased my anxiety a lot. Engage in activities you enjoy, listen to music, dance, order takeout if you can. \n\nAnd this isn't standard advise but if you're using alcohol or drugs to numb the pain, that is okay. Don't use them to ignore your feelings, but as a crutch. Once you work through your emotions, you won't need them anymore. Focus on resolving the reasons that are making you take alcohol, not the alcohol itself.\n\nDon't feel ashamed, guilty or weak. Don't apologize for being human. You will heal through this, you're doing everything you can. You're resilient, you're strong probably more stronger than you think. Sending virtual support and love, one grad student to another. We'll be fine. We'll do well. We'll complete our PhDs.",

Registrar - explain what has happened, you don't have to provide every detail - they will see your distress - not that you should have to perform it in the first place, but don't feel like you have to prove yourself or like you are making excuses. In my experience the gravity of what is happening is a lot easier to convey in a face to face discussion than via email. They will be able to give you some options. I would recommend taking time off. You don't know how this is going to play out. You are in shock right now. You might suddenly feel great next week without knowing why. Then you might be completely unmotivated to do anything for three months. Maybe attending classes will feel like a good distraction until it doesn't. Figure out potential plans for withdrawals, incompletes, other alternative routes. And be self compassionate. Taking care of yourself now will allow you to resume your life when you're ready. Rushing in runs the risk of doing poorly in school and adding a whole new layer of distress and self loathing to the grief you already have the hard work of healing through.\n2. Mental health services/school psychiatrist/disability services.  You might develop anxiety/PTSD/other trauma related mental health problems because of this. You might benefit from linking up with disability services once you are ready to resume your studies. The biggest benefit is additional flexibility which you will need.\n3. Inform your teachers. Some will be very understanding and go out of their way to help, some will be impersonal. Talking directly to teachers will make you feel like you have to justify yourself over and over. That's why I recommend talking to someone higher up first, so you don't have to explain anything unless you want to (eg professors you trust, classes you are really disappointed to be missing out on, etc). \\*Edited to add - you do need to tell them something if you have assignments due, like, tomorrow - the email posted by someone else is a great template.\n4. Day by day. What is true today will not necessarily be true tomorrow. You are entering very unpredictable territory which is why it is crucial that you are patient and nonjudmental towards yourself, and that you don't assume you can do the things you can usually do.\n\nOr you can do what I did, which is proceed as normal for the first few weeks, then stop going to classes, tell some teachers and get lukewarm replies (which made me feel insecure about the legitimacy of what I was experiencing), avoid all future emails, fail the quarter. Luckily I was rescued by a very observant and compassionate registrar who led me through the above processes and gave me a fresh start, which was incredibly validating. And it still took almost two years to feel normal academically. I think it would have been quicker if I had taken my situation seriously and handled it from the get-go.",

      "text": "I saw what you said in another comment about feeling in the past like you couldn't reveal things to the counselor or could only cry. I'd say that those are issues you can bring up right off the bat with any new counselor. Also, you might be surprised how different it feels if you find the right person, or someone practicing the right modality/approach for you. Plus crying, or clamming up, can be part of the process. Neither of them truly go on forever; they yield when it's time for something to change, or when the conditions are right\u2014the counselor doesn't feel like a stranger anymore, or the scales get tipped in some other way. If you find it hard to talk, there are also workarounds like writing out statements in advance and handing or emailing them to the therapist.\n\nMy vote would be to get a referral from your school's services to a non-school therapist or psychologist in the area, if your insurance makes it manageable. There would be a broader selection of professionals who specialize in helping with trauma like what you're experiencing. My insurance is through my university and I'm still able to do this with a low co-pay. I experienced trauma and it was really helpful. You can either call or email your school's counseling center and say: \"Hi, I'm looking to get a referral to a local therapist who specializes in trauma [be as specific as you're able]. Can you help me find someone?\"\n\nNo one decides what you do but you, but finding a good clinician who you really connect with and trust is the #1 thing I think you can do right now to love yourself\u2014and all your past selves, and all the people whose lives you touch. It takes incredible courage and strength. And you have those. I'm rooting for you.",

If you have preferences about a therapist's age, sex, qualifications, or other features, don't be shy in bringing them up when you talk to an administrator who's seeking to help you find a good fit.\n\nMy #1 advice, and what I work on for myself, is to work to *use your words*. Even if it starts out by reading a written statement aloud or simply presenting it to the therapist, they can do way more to be helpful to you if they actually know what you're thinking and feeling, and it can be a virtuous cycle for you too as you get more comfortable and confident about sharing.\n\n>I feel so utterly embarrassed. Every time I left a therapy session I had such horrific anxiety and just kept replaying it in my head.\n\nConsider including these sentences in what you share with your next therapist. They may be able to conduct sessions in a way that reduces this anxiety or offer help coping with it. It also contributes to their big picture of what's going on for you and how to address it.\n\nIn some ways a therapist can be like a medical doctor: they're acquiring objective information in order to treat a problem. In other ways they can be like a close trusted friend or family member: the two of you are building a relationship that *is in itself* an instrument of growth and healing.",

I will definitely try bringing up my difficulties talking with my next therapist. Maybe they will be able to help me get past it. I guess I have trouble thinking of therapists as objective entities. It feels more personal. But you're right, they are professionals treating an issue with one of my organs. And can be more personal of course, just have not gotten there with anyone. I will look into my options.",

      "text": "Definitely contact your teachers- most of them have been around long enough that they'll be understanding. \n\nBut ALSO contact your counseling office. They may refer you to the office of disabilities or something similar, and from there you can make requests for accommodations. They can point you to other resources as well, whether that's free therapy or how to protect your grades and GPA as much as possible in this hectic time. It's their job to know all the tips and tricks to help you, and you unfortunately won't be the first student to need their skill set.\n\nI have experienced trauma and my psyche full on shattered mid semester after a series of unfortunate events occurred, sending me spiraling. You have to become a bit of an advocate for yourself here, as the accommodations request is going to have a heavy focus on physical or lifelong disabilities- but depression and trauma are both disabilities and you can get accommodations like extended deadlines, more time on tests, and so on. It is crucial to get these accommodations in writing as there is a minority of professors who will not be understanding and will power trip about arbitrary things. I've only had one professor so far do this, and she ruined the course for me and it was a constant uphill battle of me pointing to the office of disabilities (your accommodations ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BE RESPECTED) and she sought to be a thorn in my side. \n\nMy accommodations were on an \"as-needed\" basis. For example, I could be working on an essay, and then if I spiraled and couldn't get out of bed, I would email my professor (they are informed of my accommodations prior), and request a 2 day extension with a very simple \"hey, I am experiencing a health flare and am struggling to complete tasks. I need some extra time for the assignment. Is it okay if I submit the paper on Sunday instead?\" Keeping professors in the loop generally helps, and my profs have been very understanding. Most of the time I don't need those accommodations, so I still submit most of my assignments on time. One class, I fucking fell apart, and the professor and I worked together to rewrite the course so I would complete it at a slower pace and then finish it between semesters. \n\nThere are thankfully, a lot of resources available to help students who experience horrific life events. Don't feel embarrassed asking for accommodations, they will give you breathing room while youre healing, and without accommodations I definitely would have dropped out of college that semester. It was very hard walking into that office... I felt embarrassed, like I was quitting or giving up or taking the easy way out. But the truth is, your brain is just another body part. If you got into a car accident and shattered your arms, you wouldn't be trying to handwrite 10 page essays, and nobody would expect you to! So you're not a failure if your brain is not cooperating. You're not a failure if you need help.\n\nI wish you the best of luck in this.",

          "text": "Thank you so much! As-needed accommodations sound like just what I need. I have no idea how long this will affect me, or how much worse I might get surrounding court and stuff. I didn't know this was a thing. I'll look into how to get accommodations. I honestly do feel embarrassed, but I also want to do well in my program despite all of this.",
