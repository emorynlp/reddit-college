  "text": "Earlier today I got my diploma, an award for community service and an extra certificate that I opted for and I'm relieved to have been able to pull this off during the wild COVID times but mostly because I have more of a life now. Except now that I have free time, everything is shut down and there's nothing really to do. This is a great accomplishment but with this shit economy, I'm over it already. There was no commencement, classes ended and besides a zoom call for said community service award, it just ended and that's it. I felt good for a day but it's over. I actually feel that this was not worth it at all considering the stress, sacrifices and financial burden. Any recent graduates feel the same?",

      "text": "If you haven't seen it, you should go watch the movie \"Soul\" by Pixar.  Spoiler:\n\n* >!There's a point where the main character runs into exactly the same situation you did - he hits a peak, then it's over...and nothing.!<\n\nWe're going to do a bit of a deep-dive into productivity here, because if you want to solve this problem, then you need to understand the game you're playing in a very clear way.  I can write about this easily because I'm a few years down the road & have been through all of this garbage myself lol.  Let's start out with this:\n\n>I actually feel that this was not worth it at all considering the stress, sacrifices and financial burden. \n\nThe reality is that the life we experience as human beings is vastly different than the life we THINK we experience.  You exist in the real-time stream of individual moments.  What this means is that your day consists of a few key elements, including:\n\n* How much sleep you got last night\n* How recently you ate food & how hydrated you are\n* How much global stress & pressure you feel from all of the various situations in your life\n* What you're currently working on\n\nHaving a consistent normal is important because if you win a football game with a touchdown & experience that high, you can't keep it up forever.  Likewise, if something really bad happens to you, you also can't keep that up forever.  Your body eventually winds down & puts you back at your baseline operational state.\n\nHow you experience this baseline depends on your choices, mostly physical (sleep, diet, exercise), but also mental (how you manage your commitments).  Being content is a decent baseline to start out with...from there, how you choose to inject good & great into your day is totally 100% up to you on a consistent basis.  Peak experiences are fun, but if you want to feel good & do good things every day, that requires consistent effort, and it's worth it if you want to care on a daily basis!\n\nI graduated a number of years ago under different circumstances, but all I got was a printed diploma in the mail...I didn't even get to walk across the stage.  I remember opening it up, looking at it, and saying \"meh\" after all those years of hard work.  The thing is, again, peak experiences don't last.  What I eventually came to realize is that we have that baseline, and it's our responsibility to make each day good, and there are ways to do that.\n\nOne of the ways I keep things feeling good is by using what I call a \"motivation cradle\".  Just like a hammock that has a top & a bottom mounting point, if we want to live in the cradle of motivation & feel enthusiastic about stuff, we need two things:\n\n1. A hot project we're involved in right now\n2. A hot project to look forward to\n\nAs a student, for your years in school, it's simple:\n\n1. You're actively engaged in your school work\n2. You have graduation to look forward to\n\nWhen graduation hits, the game changes, and it's up to you define your next motivation cradle.  I do this with a pretty simple planning method consisting of half a dozen lists in Google Docs:\n\n1. Bucket list\n2. 5-year plan\n3. Current responsibilities\n4. Motivation cradle (current + next hot project)\n5. Today\n6. Right now (next assignment & interruptions)\n\nA bucket list is for the fun stuff that you'd love to do eventually, but a 5-year plan is a detailed path forward of things you are actively working towards.  Previously, it was graduation.  Now, it's going to be things like career goals, personal & family goals, hobby goals, continuing education, and so on.  It's really hard not to just coast in life without a highly-detailed 5-year plan!\n\nYour current responsibilities are everything you're on the hook for now. If you're done with school, then that's going to mean things like food, rent, insurance, a car payment, finding a job, going to your job, etc.  The Motivation Cradle is a key aspect of this it's so easy to coast in life, and unless you carve out some awesome things to do for yourself, ain't no one gonna do it for ya!  Go & ask anyone what their current hot project & upcoming project is, and then compare how they feel about life to what their answers (or lack thereof) is.\n\npart 1/3",

          "text": "part 2/3\n\nIt's super easy to turn into a boring adult in life, but the good news is that it doesn't have to be that way!  Having things like a bucket list, a detailed 5-year plan, a list of your current responsibilities, and a motivation \"cradle\" can help guide into choosing what to line up to do \"today\" & what to do \"right now\" & actually be enthused & existed about it.  Because again - peak experiences don't happen very often, and when they do happen, they tend to fade & just become a good memory.\n\nIn the case of your diploma, let's shift gears: for pretty much any endeavor in life, it basically boils down to 4 choices for the type of outcomes available:\n\n1. Achievements\n2. Assets\n3. Experiences\n4. States\n\nYou *achieved* getting a Master's Degree.  You had a day of feeling good, and then bye-bye!  Time to get to work, haha!  Achievements can be personal things, like climbing a mountain (literally) or things that get invited into your life, like your degree.  That degree is going to open doors for you down the road, even though it stopped feeling exciting literally 24 hours later, lol.  It was a good & worthwhile thing to do!\n\nOther things are like that too, because everything eventually fades in excitement, which is why we have to shift gears to increase our baseline (i.e. feed ourselves well, exercise, etc. so that we feel good consistently) & invite good things into our lives every day, like lining up fun projects & assignments to work on & having stuff to look forward to.\n\nAssets are the same way.  A few years ago, I was able to get an amazing sports car as my daily driver.  It was really super fun for the first few weeks, and then the human attenuation factor set in and, well, I got used to it!  I still enjoy it quite a bit, but after that peak experience wore off, I was back to regular old me with my regular old hum-drum life.  One of the things I've learned over the years is that a huge key to long-term happiness is this:\n\n* Focus on making a contribution\n\nThat means to both yourself & to society at large.  This is because when we're focused on helping, whether it's us or other people, that gives us something to do, and more particularly, something *meaningful* to do.  When applied on a personal level, the last two outcomes above make more sense: experiences & outcomes.\n\nWhat type of experiences do you want to have on a regular basis, whether it's your work life or going on a vacation, and what states do you want to maintain, such as an energetic physical body through diet & exercise, or a neat & clean house, or a well-maintained car that gets regular oil changes, vacuumings, and car washes?\n\nSo at this point in your life, you're at a turning point: you did the thing, you got the high-five on the way out, and now what?  This introduces a key point to understand the true gravity of:\n\n* Just because you have a responsibility, doesn't mean you have a commitment to it\n\nJust because you father a child, doesn't mean you can't be a deadbeat dad, you know?  Responsibilities are things we have in our lives, but our level of commitment is up to us.  This brings into focus a concept I call \"taking adult control\" (TAC), which means:\n\n1. Identifying the situation in front of us\n2. Defining what our responsibility is to that situation\n3. Defining what outcomes we personally want in this situation\n4. Defining what our commitment level is towards those outcomes\n\nYou just graduated.  You had a great day.  Now what?  Now you get to start going through the TAC checklist for every situation in your life!  I have friends who are 40 years old & still live off ramen & hotdogs (literally) because they haven't taken adult control of their food situation, despite grocery stores having an average of 42,000 unique products, despite Youtube having over a million videos on how to cook for n00bs, despite Instant Pots existing to make cooking a push-button affair, etc.\n\npart 2/3",

You have the opportunity to take adult control over every situation in your life, for the rest of your life.  You're not a student anymore & you've faced the harsh reality that big achievements peak out & disappear in pretty short order.\n\n>I actually feel that this was not worth it at all considering the stress, sacrifices and financial burden.\n\nThe work you put into your degree, the effort you made, the stress you experienced, the financial & social & mental sacrifices you made to get through it, were 100% worth it because you finished what you set out to do.  This isn't a pep talk; this is simply recognition that you are capable of finishing hard things.\n\nYou're graduating into an economy that stinks, but if you're willing to be persistent until you achieve success & if you're willing to relocate, something will open up for you!  There are currently over 6.5 million job openings in America, so despite the current difficult circumstances, your help IS needed:\n\n* [https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm)\n\nAnd keep in mind, this economy isn't going to last forever.  The coronavirus is going to go away eventually.  Work will pick up. People are still going to be having babies & bills, and there are an endless number of important problems to solve out there...your degree is still going to be there throughout all that, and is going to open doors for you that wouldn't be open otherwise.\n\nHaving worked with a number of hiring manager & HR people over the years, I can tell you that having a degree gives you a certain type of preferred status, for a number of reasons, including (1) that it shows you can finish big, long-term projects, (2) that you're qualified to work in your field because you've put in the work & have the piece of paper to prove, and (3) that you're not going to embarrass the hiring manager because you're a safe bet.  Further reading:\n\n* [https://www.ellucian.com/insights/do-employers-still-value-college-degrees](https://www.ellucian.com/insights/do-employers-still-value-college-degrees)\n\nOn a side note, as per Stephen Covey's 7 Habits book, you should continue to \"sharpen the saw\", as mentioned in the article above:\n\n* What\u2019s the lifetime of a degree? It\u2019s shorter than you think. On average, employers believe that students should participate in further educational programs or credentialing within two years of completing their current program.\n* a one-time certification is not enough. To stay competitive, employees need to become lifelong learners. Almost 40 percent of employers think that workers need to complete additional educational programs or certifications more than once a year to stay relevant.\n\nSo let's get really specific here:\n\n1. What's your detailed 5-year plan look like?  (if you don't have one, you know what to do next! haha)\n2. What's your plan to engage in continuing education?  What industry reading do you need to keep up on every week?  Seminars? Certificates? Online or night classes?  Corporate training?  \n\nYou have a huge, amazing life ahead of you...if you want it!  No one is going to spoon-feed you from this point on; you've already learned the harsh reality of how quickly peak experiences wear off, which is really a non-issue once you understand how the game works, i.e. if you take good care of your physical body (i.e. do things that generate energy) & do some easy planning (in the form of lists), you can set up yourself up for a lifetime of high energy, high motivation, meaningful contributions to yourself, your family, your friends, your community, your company, and the world at large, and overall just have a good time getting great work done & feeling great about it!  Or not.  The choice is up to you!",

Based on your comment history, you seem to do your part to really help others. But you do write *a lot,*  and while most of it is helpful, it can be an overwhelming amount of information and detail without a summary. And with the amount of effort you are putting into your comments you'd ideally want it all to be absorbed. I recommend adding the TL;DR by default to all your detailed comments, highlighting the key/priority points to keep it concise (i.e. under 150-200 words) for those who are constrained for time and/or mental energy to take in such detailed responses. Just a friendly recommendation!",

At the risk of sounding weird, it's easy to conflate the quantity of writing with effort involved, as I type fast & am familiar with the topic, so I don't type my posts on reddit out with any type of structure in mind, they're just responses in the moment that happen to be wordy lol.\n\nFor this reason, TL;DR's are hard to do, because I'm usually just rambling about something in no particular order, so it's often hard to capture something like the three posts of information above into a single TL;DR line, as the TL;DR posted above doesn't really capture the essence of my response because I wrote my response out in one shot & it's kind of all over the map lol.\n\nAnd at the risk of sounding like a reddit jerk lol, what I *can* offer a tool that is useful for digesting large amounts of random data!  It's a technique that I've optimized over the years that seems basic on the outside, but is *super* powerful for capturing both structured (ex. textbooks) & random information (like unnecessarily long reddit posts lol) into a format that funnels the information into a more understandable & useful structure on a personal basis:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/efv9vn/iwlt\\_how\\_to\\_better\\_comprehend\\_and\\_retain\\_knowledge/fc5a7m6/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantToLearn/comments/efv9vn/iwlt_how_to_better_comprehend_and_retain_knowledge/fc5a7m6/?context=3)\n\nAgain, don't be fooled by the simplicity of the typically already-familiar methods, as I've used this approach for many years to get through classes, training seminars, boring manuals, information from /r/goodlongposts, blogs, Youtube videos (especially stuff like TED lectures), etc.   In more detail:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmemes/comments/j9fjwz/reading/g8lepz6/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmemes/comments/j9fjwz/reading/g8lepz6/?context=3)\n\n**TL;DR:** I randomly type a lot without any type of formal structure & sometimes the TL;DR would be a whole separate post by itself, which is usually a bit more effort than I want to put into neffing on reddit lol",

Given that reading one's own writing and making edits before posting is an important skill, so is learning to keep main points concise. \n\nYour response here justifies my point; it is longer than it needs to be and now has additional links and work put onto me (which I didn't ask for, but am grateful regardless). It may not be effort for you to write out a long post, but it is an effort for your reader to go over a response that is longer than necessary (and I am a fast reader, academia taught me that) or doesn't have the option of a summary if length is necessary. Your link sends me to another long comment, which has another link...and now you see the problem. \n\nThe onus should not be put on your reader, but rather in your writing. In academia we have a tendency to write without the reader in mind. Summarising your long comments (through a TL;DR or otherwise) will benefit you as a writer as well as your audience who are absorbing your information. If writing the summary takes too much effort or another post entirely, then perhaps it is an area that would benefit from some more practice and refinement. All the best!",

It's hard not to come across as harsh here, and that's definitely not my intention, and no offense is meant whatsoever, but the core issue is simply in how I use reddit - it's just a place where I chill out & type stuff when I'm eating lunch or whatever, so I usually don't go back through what I typed up to summarize it because it's just something I do for fun, in the moment.\n\nThere are resources like blogs, Medium, etc. available for more structured content, but the way I use reddit is ad-hoc, and being asked to summarize randomly-typed information out is kind of outside of how I like to waste my time here, which is why, as free information, users are free to take it or leave it as-is.  \n\nAgain, no offense is meant, and I understand what you're saying, but for me, this is kind of the online social equivalent of a watercooler chat for me.  Partly because I just like to hop on & blab about stuff, and partly because the TL;DR would be kind of excessive in & of itself for some of the overly-lengthy posts I write out here lol.  For example: (being concise is not one of my fortes lol)\n\n**TL;DR for my posts above:**\n\n* I would recommend watching the Pixar movie \"Soul\", as the main character experiences a similar situation to the one OP finds themselves in\n* We experience life differently in reality than we think we do; our physical energy has a large role to play with how we experience things, as well as our mental energy, in terms of how we manage our commitments\n* I had a similar experience myself when I graduated collection & was equally disappointed with how quickly that excitement it wore off & how fast I had to face the \"real world\", which had the silver lining of helping to push me more deeply into the world of productivity & pop psychology, in terms of learning how we as human beings operated as far as short-term & long-term motivation goes\n* Combining a multi-layered planning approach of having a bucket list, 5-year plan, a list of current responsibilities, a \"motivation cradle\", a list of things to do today, and a detailed list of next-action steps for me to do \"right now\" has been tremendously beneficial in my life in terms of providing consistently good experiences on a daily basis, as opposed to peak experiences that tend to fade quickly\n* I've found it helpful to define my outcomes in 4 categories: achievements, assets, experiences, and states.  This helps me to set targets for what I really want to do in any given situation.\n* I've learned that by focusing on making a contribution, I can side-step a lot of motivational issues because that provides me with a clear lighthouse to paddle towards & helps to fill in my day to day activities with more meaning than simply going to school or work\n* Taking adult control (TAC) of situations means identifying the situation in front of us, defining our responsibility to that situation, defining what type of outcome we want, and defining what our commitment is to that outcome\n* Using the TAC approach helps us widen our tunnelvision & lets us see all of the wonderful & amazing opportunities that are available for us.  Even kings of centuries past didn't have as much access to resources like food as we do!\n* This is a great opportunity to seize the reins of your life, as graduation marks a turning point for what you're going to be doing all day, and means that you can start defining what your responsibilities are & spelling out exactly what type of relationship you'd like to have with those responsibilities in terms of defining your personal commitment to each one (whether it's ramen & hot dogs for life or otherwise!)\n* The job market is huge right now (over 6 million jobs available), and if you're willing to relocate, *extremely* open!  Plus the current state of the economy isn't going to last forever, nor is social distancing, so we just kind of have to go through a rough patch for another year until things settle down a bit.\n* Hiring managers favor college degrees, so your college degree is not useless, and will, in fact, serve you for the rest of your life as a strong asset in the workforce, as well as for personal knowledge.\n* Continuing education is critical to staying relevant in your field & I would highly recommend implementing an ongoing learning strategy to stay at the top of your game\n* You have the power to make your life great by injecting motivation & meaning through the systems you choose to invite, setup, and maintain in your life.  No one is going to do it for you, so you're just as free to live under a bridge as you are to become the next Elon Musk, and are totally free to have a ridiculous amount of enjoyment in your day to day activities if you so desire & are willing to put in the effort for to plan & make happen!\n\nOne, that's a *really* long TL;DR (there's just too much in there to shrink down to a few one-line bullet points, so now we're at a page of a summary on a three-page post lol), and two, now that's starting to feel like work, and I'm on reddit to *avoid* doing work, hahaha!  So yeah, I get what you mean, and I 100% understand, and with no harshness meant at all, random people asking me to do extra work on a free-time activity I do for fun just isn't something I'm really interested in tbh.  And it's *really* hard to say that in a way that doesn't make me sound like a jerk & I kind of feel bad for saying it lol.\n\nPlus, anyone who really cares enough would take the time to study it out & apply it to themselves, you know?  It's sort of like how we have an endless supply of textbooks & other good books to teach us how to garden or sew or cook or do math or whatever...the information is there for the taking, and imo it creates more impact by taking our own notes so that we don't just gloss over the TL;DR & then move on with our lives with nothing actually put to use from what we read.\n\nWhich is one of the reasons sites like Buzzfeed makes $300 million a year...feel-good listicles are HUGE business!  Actually having to do work to implement amazing stuff we learn that other people have shared? Meh.\n\n**TL;DR:** Yeah I *could* do that, but I don't really wanna lol.  100% not trying to be mean or anything, this is just my free-time activity, and that's a bit more effort than I'm personally interested in putting in!",

I don't want to say I was *disappointed* when I got my diploma in the mail, but it was so incredibly under-whelming that I think I just kind of laughed.  Years of work, poof! lol.  I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but I kind of was looking for a motivational bubble to drive me for at least a good week haha!\n\nOn the flip side, that was one of the events that pushed me more into this whole idea of personal productivity & into figuring out where ongoing meaning & feeling good on a regular basis comes from, as I've since had several similar experiences where you'd think the culmination of work would give you a sort of high for at least a few days or a week, but just kind of evaporates quickly, which is what made me switch to a more \"daily good\" type of approach, as most peak experiences ended up being kind of \"meh, it's finished\" hahaha.\n\nThis whole isolation business is not good for human beings, I think.  Most of us respond *incredibly* well to social situations, like having an in-person boss or professor, or an exercise buddy, or simply the social pressure of going to a gym.  I'm a bit fortunate gym-wise because I switched to calisthenics & cardio at home a number of years ago due to my non-routine on-call work hours & just follow a simple day checklist for my routine these days so that I can pound through it & release those endorphin race horses on a daily basis lol.\n\nAnyway, it gets better!  Things kind of stink globally right now & you're being hit with the reality of how achieving a peak achievement in your goals feels, but at the same time, it's a really good time to assess your current situation & your future plans & put together a really strong support net to motivate you on a more daily basis.\n\nI still don't have it all figured out, but I am in a better position these days to feel better about life, partially due to how I've come to learn how to manage my physical energy health-wise, and partially due to how I've developed my personal planning system in terms of having an actual, written 5-year plan that doesn't just exist in my head as vaporware, and using tools like the \"motivation cradle\" to keep me plugged in on more of a daily basis.\n\nIf you're up for some (more) reading, I have some further thoughts here:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7afirj/serious\\_people\\_who\\_feel\\_lost\\_in\\_life\\_how\\_are\\_you/dp9l22i/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7afirj/serious_people_who_feel_lost_in_life_how_are_you/dp9l22i/?context=3)\n\nIf you're open to it, there's a book I always give my friends who graduate that is worth reading called \"Attitude is Everything\", which really changed my perspective on a lot of things:\n\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Attitude-Everything-Change-Your-Life/dp/0979041031](https://www.amazon.com/Attitude-Everything-Change-Your-Life/dp/0979041031)\n\nI should note that I'm not really into vague touchie-feelie stuff, and this book isn't that.  The sobering reality is that you're going to be in the workforce for the next 40+ years, and I've come to learn over the years that the way we govern our attitude has an *enormous* effect on our behavior, on the projects we get involved in, and on how enjoyable our day to day experiences are, which is why this book is such a great starting point after graduation!",

              "text": "That's awesome!  You are WAY ahead of most people in that case!!  You'd be amazed at the number of people going into the workforce with no plan, nothing to look forward to, and nothing motivational other than just \"work\".\n\n>The uncertainty of the Covid stuff is kind of taking the big picture out of it. What's the point? \n\nThis is a big reason for both the bucket list (fun wishlist items) & a detailed 5-year plan (basically the GPS guidance system for what to do on a day to day basis).  Winter won't last forever & COVID will (eventually) pass, but the efforts you put in over the next year will be cemented in your personal history for all time, and sometimes persistence is simply the focus of the game for awhile, especially when you're stuck indoors & are socially isolated.\n\nOne thing that I've found works really well is having a \"study buddy\" for doing individual assignments.  There's actually a really great website called FocusMate, where you schedule a 50-minute webcam session with a stranger.  Basically you just state your business & then quietly get to work.  It's sort of like working next to someone in a cubicle...it has a surprisingly STRONG effect on your productivity because of that social pressure. I recommend this tool to anyone in general, especially if you're struggling with the whole COVID situation & just need that extra boost:\n\n* [https://www.focusmate.com/](https://www.focusmate.com/)\n\nOn the exercise tangent, I've found calisthenics to be incredible useful because I can do 100% of my routine in my bedroom.  You can get super-ripped with minimal equipment (I have one of those cheapo doorframe pull-up bars & use a chair for stuff like dips).   Check out guys like Frank Medrano for some inspiration:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvJHw64fxgQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvJHw64fxgQ)\n\n>My immediate goals for this year are to self teach myself sql and R, and get a certificate in health data analytics.\n\nIf you don't already have a personal study plan setup, I have two really useful tools for tackling this:\n\n1. Finite molehills first\n2. Decoupled progress tracker\n\nLet's break down the first one: \"finite\" means that you have a list of what stuff you want to get done today, not a vague idea & not a huge, overwhelming list.  I create this by doing a simple evening planning session for the next day, where I create a realistic list of assignments to complete.  This can seem incredibly difficult at times, because we feel pressured to do a LOT of stuff, but if you don't have a finite list of stuff to work on, then you'll never get that finite list done! (I struggle with this CONSTANTLY lol)\n\n\"Molehills\" simply means we split up the information into small bites, so that we're not constantly having to do huge amounts of work.  I grew up in some serious self-imposed insanity in terms of doing weekend crams, all-night essays, etc. & it was not a healthy (or fun) approach whatsoever.  Divvying up projects & then spreading them out over time on a calendar schedule is huge, and wasn't something that ever naturally \"clicked\" for me during my grade-school days, unfortunately.\n\n\"First\" means doing your pre-selected small-bite before doing anything else.  I don't know how the universe operates for anyone else, but for me, time isn't so much linear as much as has an ebb & a flow, and when I goof off first, time tends to slip away & then I'm stuck staying up late, rushing to get stuff done.  The simple key is \"work first, play later\".  \"Finite molehills first\" is fairly obvious written out, but for me at least, it's something I really have to work at & schedule every single day, because otherwise I tend to not get much done & then have to deal with a lot of unnecessary stress.\n\nSo with that approach, the way I study stuff is by using a Decoupled Progress Tracker.  This is a fancy phrase for Excel & a recurring calendar entry, lol.  What I do is divide up my work into small bites, stick it in a spreadsheet, and then put a recurring calendar entry to study at a specific time every day.  Again, fairly obvious on paper, not so obvious in practice!  It took me a really long time to come up with & internalize this concept lol.  So it basically goes like this:\n\n1. Select some material to study (ex. a SQL in R textbook)\n2. Break it up into small bites (i.e. sections of a chapter) to study every day & list every single section in a column in a spreadsheet.  Create one column header for \"Study Session\" and a second one for \"Date Completed\"\n3. Create a recurring daily calendar entry for your daily study session.  Just call it generically \"Study session for SQL in R\".  This way, if you have a sick day or a lazy day or whatever, it doesn't goof up the whole calendar because you didn't program each task into the calendar - you've decoupled the reminder of the task from the description (chapter section) of the task, so that you get prompted when to do it & then track your progress on the spreadsheet. Hence, the DCT or \"Decoupled Progress Tracker\"!  Incredibly simple, incredibly powerful!\n\nAgain, this all sounds super basic, but forcing myself to do an initial study-setup planning session gives me very specific, doable assignments that I can inject into my \"finite molehills daily\" approach, because it gives me a concrete chunk of something to actually DO each day.  You can then combine that study session with a FocusMate assignment, meaning:\n\n* You have an extremely specific, doable task to complete\n* You have a scheduled time to work on it\n* You have social pressure to motivate you to do it\n\nRidiculously simple, yet *ridiculously* powerful in practice!  Previously, I used to keep everything in my head & would try to hitch my daily motivation feeling to the \"big idea of (whatever) project I was working on\" wagon, but just like how you discovered that a peak achievement wears off quickly, I learned that my motivation would come & go over time, so I needed a different method for actually *really doing stuff* like studying at home by myself.\n\nThe cool thing is, this applies to a LOT of stuff!  This is basically how I've learned how to cook over the years, how I've stayed current in my field at work, how I've studied various topics for business & personal purposes, how I tackle doing chores, working out, etc.  Everything boils down to having a crystal-clear task in front of me, and then lining those tasks up & banging them out before I goof off (the whole \"finite molehills first\" concept).\n\nIt sounds easy, but it *does* take some effort to define your assignments & line them up for the next day consistently, but the payoff is that you're not stuck waiting on the motivation to strike, because everything is laid out in front of you in a very doable way, and you can call on resources like FocusMate to help you power through those explicitly-defined tasks as needed!\n\nIf you're open to it, let's give this approach a shot right now!  What is required to obtain a certificate in health data analytics, and what's your deadline for when you'd like to get it done by?",

There were so many times where my graduation was delayed or that I was about to mentally implode but I made it. I had my last zoom \"class\" and then a month later I got a box with some papers in it. I slid that box under my bed and that was it.",

I'm in my last semester and I'm wrapping up what will be the 3rd chapter of my thesis before I wrap up the first and second because there's not enough data for the 2nd, but I have it mostly written, and every time I do something I just add on to chapter 1. I need this to be over, the anxiety of forgetting something simple that will prevent me from graduating is giving me an immense amount of anxiety",

For the take 2, I was looking forward to walking, I was going to do cartwheels, I wanted to shake hands with all the profs I was so close to. In undergrad I was aloof and slept in the back of the room and squeaked my way out of undergrad. For my masters, my second chance at college and I went above and beyond but there wasn't that \"river crossing\" ceremony that made me feel I'm moving on to the next chapter. \n\nI've been sitting and working out of my 1 room apartment for months and that moment was a piece of mail that I get a ton of. I got honors cords too but no moment to wear the get up, have a picture like my brother or friends have. I was in a sweat and hoodies with fancy papers and cords in a bubble wrap envelop thing.",
