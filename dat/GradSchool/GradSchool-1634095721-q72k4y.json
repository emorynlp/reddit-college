  "text": "This school is in another state and I was excited but I\u2019m realizing, due to personal reasons, I should probably stay closer to home. I applied to several schools in my state already but just haven\u2019t heard back. Am I allowed to cancel a deferral in favor of another school? I already made the acceptance/defer deposit a bit ago so I\u2019ve made peace that I won\u2019t get that back and that\u2019s fine.",
