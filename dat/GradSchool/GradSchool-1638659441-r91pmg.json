Most of my friends are out of the physics program. I met these ones through an undergrad club, and then through a badminton club comprised of primarily grad students (I found out about this club through my physics friend though). Physical activities is a good way to make friends, you can try asking your colleagues if any of them would be interested in going to the uni gym you are at to play badminton or rock climbing or whatever is offered\n\nFor romance, try tinder/hinge/cmb I guess lol",

Like at this radio station, we can be friends because we just like music a lot. I like the people in my program, but all we ever do together is generally school-related.",
