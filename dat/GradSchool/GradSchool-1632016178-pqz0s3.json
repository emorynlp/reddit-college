  "title:": "Not able to get letters of recommendation due to previous professors passing away (there is only 1 left alive)",
  "text": "My undergrad was a BFA in a very specific conservatory field, and I graduated in 2008. I\u2019m now looking at MFA programs, but I\u2019m hung up on one thing - letters of recommendation!\n\nMy conservatory program had us working with 4 professors very closely, and it was amazing. Those professors put so much into our tiny cohort, they basically lived with us for 3 years. But, shortly after graduating, my main professor passed away from cancer, and a few years later, another passed. The third died from covid a few months ago, leaving me with one professor I\u2019m still close to who is willing to write me a letter. But it says I need 3.\n\nThere were some peripheral teachers that we worked with, but it was almost wholly those 4, and now I\u2019m stumped as to what to do. \n\nDo professional contacts work for these? I have done art as a contractor for my current boss, so that is one I could potentially have, but I am not sure where that would go as their actual field is unrelated to my MFA application. Also, it would be in.... not the best English, as that is not their first language, and I\u2019m afraid that that would reflect poorly on me, even with the caveat that they are not native speakers. \n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for your time.",

For the one that was less related to my field, I wrote them a detailed letter explaining the program and my related activities/skills that they might not be aware of from our working relationship.",

My BFA is in costume production, I just wish I was still able to do more with it now (some health issues and moving to the other side of the globe basically mean no sewing time or equipment)",

      "text": "I\u2019m so sorry - that sounds difficult. \n\nI also graduated from college in 2008 and my main mentor/advisor passed away several years ago, so last year when applying to grad school I used only professional contacts for recommendations even though they were unrelated to my field. The contacts could speak to my reliability, adaptability, creativity, communication skills, etc. which I assume is what people reading them want to hear about regardless of the specific program. I got into my top choice so it worked out fine. \n\n\nIf you have any concerns I\u2019d give the programs to which you\u2019re applying a call and explain the situation for their feedback.",

I don't have any answers short of contacting where you're applying and explaining the situation, because that is most certainly tragic and the definition of extenuating circumstances.",
