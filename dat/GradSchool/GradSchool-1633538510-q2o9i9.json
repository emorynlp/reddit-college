  "title:": "Want to Drop Out but Already Half Way Through",
  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm in year 2 of a two-year master's program, we just started our first quarter a few weeks ago and I am not happy. I started to want to drop out after the first quarter of my first year because I did not feel like I fit into the program and quite frankly the classwork felt outdated, the teachers were mostly apathetic, and I wasn't fitting in with my cohort. I decided to stay because I did find a few people I thought I was friends with and thought it would be stupid to leave if I'm already this far and it was covid times and I didn't really have anything better to do.\n\nWe are now back in person (though still have online classes) and these same feelings have reared their heads again. I hate most of my classes, I've had more intellectually stimulating classes in community college than I have here, I'm not learning here, and I am not enjoying being on campus, it's a campus of mostly undergrads and as I'm nearing 30 I just don't fit in with the frat/sorority vibe here.\n\nIn addition, my cohort is very friendly with each other, they all text and hang out with each other and while I sometimes get invited most of the time I'm in the corner by myself. I just don't feel a part of it and even this morning my group mate admitted they didn't even notice I was missing. It's like if I'm not getting the intellectual part nor the social part then I don't know why I am here. Should I just suck it up and do the next ten months, getting the degree is better than not but I feel so ashamed to be here. or is it better to try and see I can get into another program or just get a job in my field with this half of masters so to speak lol?",

          "text": "I'm sorry if that comes off as a humblebrag but I don't really think it's that I'm too smart, it's just this program is not that great. I'm not the only one in my cohort or in the past of this program who has had this feeling. I have a job/internship in my field as well as a job offer from my former employer in a completely unrelated field. I'm trying to see if it's possible to transfer to another school that may align with my goals and area of study. I do agree that there is probably a lot more value to finishing but the thought of 10 more months of this sends me on a spiral.",

Treat it like a job you have to go to everyday, but you're not thrilled about. \n\nYou have what? 9 months left? That's not that long just to put your head down and get it done.",
