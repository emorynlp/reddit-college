  "text": "I am going to lay everything on the table here; sorry if it is long.\n\nSo, long story short, I went to grad school out of my need for housing. My undergrad lease was up the month I graduated and I was very fortunate to obtain a graduate assistantship that included housing in the contract. To be completely honest, I did not want to go to grad school but I took the position for the housing as I had no where else to go and not enough money to start a new lease elsewhere and also could not renew my old lease.\n\nAnywho, I ended up going to grad school in a field that I majored in during undergrad. However, I found the coursework far too hard and I transferred to an \u2018easier\u2019 program. I transferred to the new program as I 1) explored several programs but found I was unqualified or would be forced to graduate after my assistantship contract ended, which I could not afford. I ended up choosing my current program because it deals with the same industry as my assistantship. Since being in the program, I have discovered I have no interest in continuing in the field after graduation (primarily because it caused so much stress on my body and mental state).\n\nI am set to graduate in one semester\u2019s time. No idea what to do after college. Worry I will be on the beginning of a career path I hate. I\u2019e spoken to a career counselor and she asked me to research jobs I may enjoy; I have done so but none require a masters\u2019 degree, and most are for high schoolers. I don\u2019t think I want an actual career after I graduate, if that makes any sense. I just want a 9-5 job where I don\u2019t have to take home work. Yet, I also worry about my financial situation. I now have 5 or so month to figure out a new place to live and what I want to do with my life. I hated renting previously because I just threw money at the wind but I can\u2019t buy a house in my area right now. It all feels like its going to suck from here on out.\n\nAnyone else go into grad school but find they do not care at all about their industry and want to get out? Or, anyone else struggle with balancing happiness and finances? How did you all pull through?",

You need a job.\nBut you don't want a demanding job. Ok, that's fair enough.\nYou don't want to work in your field. \nBut you also don't want a job that's \"below\" you.\n\nWell. Which one is it? Do you want a job or not? If you can't think of a dream job, what's wrong with just picking something you are qualified to do? There are plenty of totally fine entry level office jobs in the world (of course dependent on where you live etc, but in general), like admin roles of various kinds, that just require a degree and where you clock in and out. Also, those jobs that just require a high school diploma could be interesting work places that have opportunities for people with degrees. I know plenty of people with MBAs etc who do really well in retail and hospitality, for example. \n\nWork doesn't have to be where you are most fulfilled in your life. Work could also just be a means to an end, a way of supporting yourself so you can afford doing fun stuff outside of work.",

      "text": "It seems like you need to understand the reality of most graduates - you're going to have turbulent times, esp getting your first professional job aka foot in the door. Not many people can graduate right out of school at 22-24 and buy a house solely based on income from their first job. Chances are you're going to have to soldier through bad jobs in the beginning before you have some leverage (experience & network) to get better jobs. You would also need to sit down and spend some time understanding your interests/passions, as well as your strengths and weaknesses so you can try to avoid a similar situation in the future (this feeling/situation can also come back in your 30s and 40s if you ignore it now)",

The key is to use them as a stepping stone so that you can develop the skills that will allow you to negotiate for a better work situation:\n\n* Better pay\n* More interesting work\n* Autonomy\n* Having a real impact\n\n\nAt this point you should just get into anything you are qualified for that you can tolerate.

Your thesis/major project, research assistantships, TA opportunities etc all help that! See if your school has a career centre that could help build your CV.",

      "text": "Hard to say much without knowing your field. Can you teach it? Theres a massive shortage on teachers. Are there lower level 'good' jobs that at least relate to the skill? A computer science masters is extremely overkill for a data entry job for example, but it would probably be really easy for someone with that skillset at a masters level. \n\n\nThe other reality here is that the biggest consequence of picking the wrong masters is that youve already made the decision that will decide your life balance. You can make more being unhappy or less in a job outside of your field (or, hell, luck out and get more with an unrelated job). But your quickest path to money, using your proven skillset, won't make you happy. At that point I think the answer is to look at yourself from a personal and financial side. I cant think of a single full time job exclusively staffed by high schoolers. If you wanna be a camp counselor or something, sorry, itll probably need to be a side hustle. \n\nBeyond that, it sounds like, just based on this small piece you wrote, that the real issue is a serious misunderstanding of the financial reality of today. I had a few friends buy houses (granted it was am extremely cheap area) during grad school, but that was the plan all along, they saved their assistanship money like crazy, and worked the summers, with that explicit goal. Its not easy for a grad student to do. If you couldnt afford to graduate undergrad, couldnt afford a lease, couldn't afford to graduate grad school, you aren't even really close to being able to put down on a house. All you need right now, in the next 5 months, is 3 months rent which, if your housing is covered, pretty much any job should be able to generate if you arent getting paid already/blew through the money, and a job that will cover rent. Might mean roomates. Might even mean finding a cheaper area. But if youve ran out of money three times now just in college, the issue probably isnt the salaries of jobs that interest you (unless you live in one of the crazy expensive areas, in which case, Is just deal with working in your field for now or leave), its your ability to live within your means. Given that you arent interested in your degree field, or higher level jobs in general, your lifestyle is probably the thing that will need to change.",
