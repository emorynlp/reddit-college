  "text": "Throughout the last couple of years living with friends, the biggest issues I've always had were people forgetting to do their chores or pay me back for bills. As much as I loved the guys I lived with they frustrated me sooo much because of these issues. I decided that I'm going to be proactive about it and channel my frustration into something productive. Because of all this, I spent the last 2 months building a roommate app from scratch. It's not much that I feel like it's pretty good so far. There is still some testing I have to do so I'm not launching it just yet. I'm going to launch it this Sunday. I'll add a link in the description on Sunday and create another post describing the app in more detail.\n\nI'll answer any questions you guys may have below.\n\nTL;DR - I had cruddy roommates for years, built an app to split chores and bills, releasing the app here on Sunday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: \\*3 Days Remaining\\* Hey everyone, app testing is running smoothly. The team and I haven't run into any major bugs and everything in the app seems to be working great. We still have a bunch of the app to still go through but it looks like we're still on track to release this Sunday at 8 AM Eastern Standard Time.\n\nUpdate: \\*2 Days Remaining\\* Good news everyone! The bug fixes are going smoothly, we're also in the process of adding a few suggestions a few of you guys PM'd us. We're still on track to get it all done by Sunday 9 AM\n\nUpdate: \\*1 Day Remaining\\* Great news everyone! We just have a few minor bugs remaining and we've successfully added all the features. The app will officially be releasing tomorrow at Sunday 9 AM New York Time.\n\n**Update Post Explaining WeDivvy -** [Update Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/pibr7y/update_release_of_the_roommate_app_to_end_all/)\n\n**WeDivvy App Store URL -** [**https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wedivvy/id1570700094)\n\n**WeDivvy Play Store URL** \\- Coming Soon",
