I eat whatever they leave over, plus anything I can scavenge on-campus.

          "text": "For what it's worth, my grad school experience has been pretty fantastic. My project is amazing-literally everything I dreamed about before coming to grad school. I have a paper, I have finding, I get to travel.  My PI is super supportive and I get along with her really well.  My cohort is generally great as well, and they are some of my closest friends right now. My lab is fantastic- full of people I enjoy spending time with. \n\nAll that being said, grad school is still grad school. It's busy, it's stressful, and sometimes you don't have time to cook or shop and find yourself eating Indian takeout for breakfast at 5 am while you grade student assignments.  But that's not every day, nor is it even most days. \n\nThis list was supposed to be light-hearted. Some of the things on it I am deeply proud of; I had never dissected a mouse before grad school.  That I can now pull the organs from a mouse in five minutes is an accomplishment for me. That being said, there is a certain joy and comradery that comes out of sharing the downs.  I think that's why we tend to enjoy PhD comics. My cohort has become closer by sharing the insanity. \"I are peanut butter for dinner.  Who am I??\" \"I don't know, but I've eaten nothing but pizza slices.\". And then we both feel more human.\n\nSo go to grad school.  Enjoy it. But don't go to learn more about yourself, go because you need to. And find the sick joy that comes out of stuffing your pockets full of peanuts.  There will never be another time in your life when you can do that.",

Hurray, another round of RT-qPCR... another Western... all while working twice the hours for half the pay you deserve. I know how much of a toll the PhD took on me, and the last thing I want to do is submit myself to that again. So, in a way, I don\u2019t know what I want to do, at least at the practical level.",

As my project \"evolved\" I have grown to spend most of my time analyzing -omics data (which is fascinating!). My concern is that as a \"homegrown\" individual without formal training, I don't really fit into the qualifications of a bioinformatician; but I'm not really sure that I'd want to spend my days doing only that as it is. The thing I think I'd love is working in the field of automating research. I love to tinker, play with Raspberry pi systems, etc; got a weird lab issue or did a shaker break? I'll give my shot at fixing it.\n\nBut more and more, I see an open area for implementing cost-effective, reproducible solutions. Most of those robotic pipetting machines are ludicrously expensive, but a few companies have proven it doesn't have to be. Opentrons makes them starting ~$5000, a cost that nearly any lab could stomach if they feel the need. Other areas that show promise are things with the phone / pi devices. Need a live imaging camera in an incubator? You could figure out a way to do that with a pi. Need to count cells? Assuming you can come up with a strong model, you could have the phone take an image and estimate the count off a hemocytometer. These sort of things can potentially speed up the process, reduce human bias (of course, there will always be a bias though), and provide detailed records automatically.  Certainly, there are already solutions out there for these things; but as electronics continue to get cheaper and these small computing devices get more powerful, I think it will open doors for all sorts of possibilities. I'd like to be a part of that!",
