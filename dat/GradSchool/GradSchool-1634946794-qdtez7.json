  "title:": "Do all recommendations have to be from your undergrad school?",
  "text": "So if a school asks for 3 recommendations do they all have to be from school. I have two teachers that I was close with that will write for me but the third is tricky, I really didn't connect with other professors like I did with them and this means I don't have a 3rd(I could ask my Chinese professor since I had him for a few classes but it doesn't feel like a good idea). I got a job as a lab tech shortly after graduating and I think a letter from the lab manager would be really good but I don't know if that's ok. Any help is appreciated as I am trying to really get on this before December 1st when most apps are due.",

      "text": "I did lots of research as an undergrad and fortunately had multiple recommenders who I mixed and matched for different programs. But to most programs, I submitted two from summer internships and one from a professor (whom I also did research with...). I was applying for a STEM PhD, so research recommendations carried a lot of weight. \n\nWhatever you're applying for, though, I think 2 academic and 1 practical letter sounds like a strong combination.",
