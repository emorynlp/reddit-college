  "text": "3rd year PhD student here.\n\nBeen struggling with pretty severe depression throughout grad school. Have tried a variety of medications and haven't found any of them that effective.\n\nPublished 2 papers, one first-author, during my first year while working 8-5. Then did nothing for a year during COVID-19: didn't get out of bed; lost 25 lbs; et cetera, et cetera. Obviously, I didn't publish that year.\n\nNow I'm in my 3rd year and staring down the barrel of quals. I'm not ready. I'm barely interested in research these days, and I find my mind wandering constantly even when I'm doing things I'm theoretically interested in (like video games and hobbies). I don't read anything anymore. I go home after a useless 6-hour day and sleep for 12-14 hours. Spend a lot of time berating myself for being a lazy slacker.\n\nPsychiatrist thinks I may have comorbid ADHD (combined type), but I can't get stimulants without seeing a neuropsychologist. I *can't* see the big neuropsychology clinic in town: I *work there!* Non-stimulant meds have not been helpful.\n\nI'm planning to go into clinical work: I like it a lot better than research, and it's harder for me to space out/lose whole days/wander off to go pace the halls if there's a live patient in front of me. I just need to figure out how to focus/care enough to pass quals and get my dissertation out.\n\nHas anyone here come back from something like this?",

You deserve to be happy in life. \n\nI believe you might benefit from practicing a meditation called \"metta,\" or loving-kindness. Here is a link to an one you can try - https://prajnalifecoaching.com/a-simple-loving-kindness-meditation-to-carry-in-memory/\n\nIf you were a kind observer of yourself, what would you say you need at the moment? If it helps, you can imagine yourself as a person who genuinely cares for you seeing your situation. \n\nI wish you good health navigating this",

      "text": "As someone with ADHD, depression, severe anxiety and who is currently pregnant in grad school, I find that the only way to stay on top of my mental health is exercise, sunshine and drinking a lot of water.  I mean it sounds cheesy and cliche, but for me it is the only way to stay off meds.  I have been diagnosed with every mental illness under the sun but if I manage to get out walking a couple times a week it's just the only way I can function.  And it is fucking hard, because I have no energy.  I have cried, snotted and blubbered for three miles once.  But it works.  Now I need to take my own advice because I am feeling like shit too, right now.  Best of luck!",

      "text": "OP, that's fantastic that you are getting this out there and expressing your struggle to other people. I'm sorry that non of the medication that you have tried has helped youth's far but please keep looking. That being said, are you also going to therapy? Expressing yourself to another person, especially a therapist, is extremely helpful. Also, as cliche is the sounds,  exercise has a crazy amount of benefits no matter where your at. I know that suggestion might seem insane or insurmountable right now, so please take it with a grain of salt. Getting out of whatever habitual schedule you have right now, and I get it, it's a lot, so whatever time you can carve out to break up the  Monotony could be helpful. Litteraly doing things in the morning that you do at night and visa versa can actually help just to not feel like everything is always the same.\n\nI hope this help. Being bogged down is one of the worst feeling. It suffocating. It's claustrophobic. It can be so all consuming that you may feel buried, half alive, with no light to see. So I know what I have writen won't solve everything, but I hope it helps to know thay everyone in these comments is here to help. Dosent help with school...but I hope it helps with you.",
