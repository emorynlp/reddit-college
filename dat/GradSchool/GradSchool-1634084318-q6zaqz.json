  "text": "Hello all,  \nI am currently applying for a post-doc in the lab of an important lab in my field and in the application they are asking for my cover letter and a CV.  \nI was wondering how often PIs even look at the cover letter. Will they even look at it, or are they just going to jump straight to my CV?\n\nAny feedback would be helpful. Thank you all!",
