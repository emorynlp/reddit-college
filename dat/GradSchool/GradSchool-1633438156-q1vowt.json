  "title:": "How do I know if I am actually capable of a PhD position?",
  "text": "I am currently an MSc student. My grades overall have been consistently good during my programme and I did well with my initial thesis. I am currently doing my second research internship. I have no signs of having anything published yet but I have two more theses to write, so perhaps I can manage to create a piece of work that is able to be published (I won't get my hopes up). I have also been awarded a research fellow position by my supervisor to work with her this year on her research. \n\nHowever, I look at PhD vacancies to try and understand the application process and I just can't imagine how I would ever be impressive enough to successfully apply for one. I guess what I am wondering is, what is required to be accepted to a PhD programme? \n\n1. Do you need an idea of your research plan when applying?\n2. How many practical research skills are expected, or is there still an element of learning? \n\nI understand these things are often specific to the field of study. For context, my MSc is in ecology and evolution and I study in Europe. The country I am in regard PhD candidates as employees, they are paid a salary by universities. So maybe there is an extra level of competence needed?",

      "text": "As you have already guessed, it depends. The positions I have applied for were not publicly available, so I have just sent the labs of interest my documents (cv, letter of motivation, transcripts and diplomas and, probably most importantly, letters of recommendation). They have invited me to present my thesis and for usual job interviews. The projects were pretty much predefined (with some freedom left and right of course) but funded by some grants and by that bound to specific projects. So I did not have a research plan (I know from one university you have to hand in a proposal after one year though) but I have worked as a student research assistant for several years. Maybe it is different in your field. Nevertheless, also sending documents if they do not explicitly state vacancies is recommended and others will decide if they believe you\u2019re capable or not.. Given your comment, I\u2019d say chances are not too bad if you can \u201esell yourself\u201c in an interview as well.",
