  "title:": "What are red flags of low quality graduate programs?",
  "text": "I'm reading an article about masters programs which serve as more of a trap rather than an opportunity. What stood out to me was how a seemingly reputable university (uChicago) preys on naive undergraduates and uses personal prestige to sell an expensive graduate program that has terrible market value. And yet, their marketing is so good that an average student, or one desperate to go to grad school, wouldn't even notice.\n\nSo my question is: what are the red flags of low quality graduate programs? What advice can you give for students trying to wade through the marketing bs to find a good program?\n\nArticle: [https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-masters-trap](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-masters-trap)\n\nAnother Article: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773](https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: If you want to get into the data, check out the source directly - US Dept. of Educations College Scorecard offers information on income, debt, acceptance rate, field and level of study (e.g. associates to phds).

              "text": "Yeah, sure thing! I applied to several funded master's program and got in with good deals, but the program I chose does not fund masters students. The reason I chose this particular program because of the classes offered (at other institutions, I wouldn't have a chance to take those), and I got to continue taking classes with professors that I already became close with. \n\nThat was just some background information on me, but now, I will showcase my process. First, I suggest contacting your grad coordinator, but if your department does not fund master's students (which seems to be the case since you're asking about this), I suggest contacting your institution graduate school for assistantship opportunities. I also suggest contacting other departments. For instance, if you took lots of courses in a certain subject in undergrad (like if you were a double major or minored in a field), then contact the grad coordinator of that department, and in the email, list all the relevant courses you took in that field. Other departments to contact are the Career Center (and Student Affairs, office of diversity), any tutoring departments to work as a tutor or office-related work (for instance, I go to a Division I school, which offers free tutoring to its student-athletes, so I contacted the athletic department about assistantships related to tutoring or office-based work). If you're a strong writer, I suggest contacting the writing center (make sure you attach a writing sample). If you have decent coding experience, see if the computer science/artificial intelligence has any assistantship positions. If there's professors you're close to or want to do research with, see if they have a research assistantship available. Another way to look for assistantship is to look up Human Resources Department (which usually has a list of jobs available for professor positions and graduate student led positions). \n\nMoreover, while knowing who to contact is important, so is your message in your email. If you're contacting the graduate school or other departments, you should mention that your department doesn't fund masters students. Here's my template:\n\nDear \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_,\n\nI am \\[here, include what year you are and what you're studying\\]. I have been accepted to \\[name of degree\\]. (Note: If you're already a graduate student (from your flair), you don't have to include this second sentence). Write a sentence about trying to find a graduate assistantship. I then mentioned deals that other institutions have offered me - don't worry if this isn't the case for you because it's really hard to negotiate deals anyways. Mention that you already talked with the grad coordinator about this and say that the department doesn't fund master's students but your grad coordinator encouraged you to contact other department. If relevant, mention why you are a good candidate, like if you studied x in undergrad, include all the relevant courses (if you go to the same undergrad institution for grad school, mention the names of the professors whom you took the class). End with I attached my CV (and a writing sample - only mention the latter if relevant). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you,\n\nemail signature \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I hope this helps; if you need help, we can always chat over DM. Good Luck!**",

      "text": "I think I'm a bit of an outlier here because I got incredible funding for my masters from one of those big name prestigious schools. It will only cost me a few thousand every 6 months to get my masters in a feild that typically you pay to get it (def a cash cow for schools, but it's a professional program). My perspective here is for a masters in a professional program. Red flags from what I saw where:\n\n1. Schools that offered admissions to a certificate program or newer masters program after denying you your first choice. These where almost always useless certificates or radically different programs that would cost thousands of dollars. Huge pass.\n\n2. Programs and schools that had zero flexibility for working students. My top choice program told me when I was accepted that they strongly discouraged students from working and had zero processes in place if you ever needed to drop below full time status for any reason. It was basically a full commitment or you where kicked out of the program. In a post covid world it seems unrealistic to expect that from students and crippling their ability to make money while in school is a big red flag. They should be actively helping you find work in your feild and willing to work with you on life events.\n3. Schools that are cagey or vague about funding. Again, my first choice school told my cohort that none of us would know if we got a scholarship or funding untill one month before the program started (ie after acceptance deadlines for our program and others had long passed). They also only offered 1 full scholarship, and if you weren't the lucky person who got it your would need to pay full price. They where incredibly dismissive and unwilling to work with any of us to be more transparent about funding and ultimately wanted to play \"will they or won't they\" with our finances. Compare this to my school I'm at and accepted which told all admitted students that they can and SHOULD always ask for more funding and got us all our funding offers within 1 week of our acceptance notifications. In addition they provided us 1:1 hour long talks with financial aid to get all our questions answered and to negotiate our aid packages. My school even adjusted the amount of funding I got after the school did raise tuition by %2 to cover the difference so my scholarship was still covering what we negotiated (they did it unprompted). Long story short, one school treated it's students as a cash flow and you where on your own vs the other bent over backwards to help students get more money.\n4. Lots of recent graduates on LinkedIn only have \"recent graduate\" as their job or are working in completely unrelated industries. That means their school didn't do well helping connect them with employers and just took their money. Or they learned little to no marketable skills.\n5. Ask for the course catalogue and see what kind of classes you'll be taking. Are they all ungrounded, thought based work? Run. Are they teaching you hard skills like R, Python, writing, research design, community work, etc? Great! A few classes about feminism in the 21st century are fine, but you need hard skills to make your program worth it. They should be teaching you something more than you could read in a book. And hard skills should be grounded in some kind of work or result you can add to your resume, not just a course you could have watched for free on YouTube with no product.",

Many schools will locate the academic study of History, for instance, within social sciences, while others consider History to be a Humanity. \n\nThen, within the obvious social sciences (Psychology, Political Science, etc.), you have a huge range of different research approaches. Psych has people who do traditional \"social science\" (i.e. focused on human behavior, especially its inherently social aspects), vs. those who do the overlaps with neuro. Political Science has theorists and folks who are indistinguishable from philosophers, but it also has people who do whizbang quantitative modeling and forecasting, etc. \n\nI'll take it, even if my work (Political Science) doesn't even remotely touch on any of that cool stuff. I personally have to know a little bit of technical stuff b/c of my subject matter emphasis (WMD technology & export controls) but nowhere near NSF grant level stuff.",

At the same time, quite a few engineering masters programs are unfunded, especially if they're an interdisciplinary blend of business, engineering, and computer science. \n\nReading the advice on reddit you see people saying \"if it's unfunded, RUN\" ... but like, if even *Stanford* rarely offers funded masters degrees in your discipline, where do you go from there",

Which field is it? \n\nBreaking into academia/research? You know most(if not all)PhD programs in US don't require a master, right? And again, I could be an ignorant but I never heard unfunded PhD programs, either. \n\nIf your point is PhD, then I'm not the person you should be discussing/arguing/talking to. I was talking about a master program.\n\nLastly, you want to do research but earn a heck tons of money? Please reconsider your life goal.",

Whatever important, it comes first. \n\nMy point is that these people made the unfunded grad programs like they are evils. They only want money. They are bad. I think these people capable of knowing the differences between for-profit and non-profit schools, but they still try to put the image of for-profit schools onto the unfunded grad programs at non-profit schools. I would say, most of the top master programs are unfunded.\n\nI might sound like an A hole but i feel like because these people can't get into those programs or can't afford it so them made themselves believe that \"well those programs are just cash cows trying to get my money. they are bad, i dont need them\"",
