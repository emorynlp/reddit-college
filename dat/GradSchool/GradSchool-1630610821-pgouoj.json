  "title:": "How selective is UChicago for grad admissions in inorganic chemistry",
  "text": "Any UChicago chem grad student out there? I'm planning on applying to the UChicago chem grad program in inorganic chemistry. I have 1 year+ 2 summers worth of solid research exp but don't have any publications yet (bc I couldn't collect data during the COVID-19 lockdown). Might be able to submit 2 just in time for the December 1 deadline. GPA 3.7. I'll get 3 good LORs (2 professors + 1 associate professor).   \nHow does my profile compare to a typical successful applicant to the UChicago grad program?    \nAlso, will COVID-19 have any effect on the selection rates (bc of lack of funding, many applicants losing out at least a year of experimental research exp, etc.)?  \nThanks in advance",

      "text": "Fellow uChicago applicant here (but for integrative neuroscience program) :) Its a huge relief to hear that others feel like they missed out on experience because of COVID - I had a lab position set up to begin at the end of March 2020 but shut down due to COVID so my resume took a massive hit. Sorry I'm not able to answer any of your questions but wanted to pop in and wish you good luck, sounds like you have a strong chance!",
