  "text": "I wanted to get some ideas since I've seen a lot of posts about quitting or not enjoying graduate school. At what point is it not worth it to you to continue?\n\nFrom my perspective, I'm just about to enter my third month of graduate school and my mental and physical health are not doing very well; I already had underlying issues and now they've been brought to the fore. I'm curious, what sort of things would cause you to leave a program. Hospitalization? Nervous breakdown?\n\nUpdate: Currently sitting in the ER, didn't trust myself to just sit in my room with some of the stuff I have in there. Not making any decisions about my program, just trying to get through today and tomorrow.",

      "text": "My mental health tanked in my third year after advancing to candidacy.  At some point during the summer between second and third year, communication broke down between my PI and I spiraled into a depressive episode that lasted until the following spring. During that time, I had been working on a project while completely misunderstanding some of the fundamental ideas.  I figured it out while we were addressing reviewer comments, causing my PI to flip out. She ended up trying to convince me I wasn\u2019t passionate about the field and force me out of the program entirely, but some part of me knew that she was wrong. So, I went on compassionate leave to 1) get my shit together and 2) take any decisions about my future out of her hands. I came back nine months later, mastered out of her group, and joined a new one where I\u2019ve been thriving. I\u2019m on track to defend comfortably within the next three years, probably within two.",

I know that grad school is harder than undergrad but this program in particular offered quite literally zero support- when I asked my advisor for additional resources such as tutoring she said they had none. At that point I was over working on my PART TIME program for 40+ hours when I WORK FULL TIME. I said fuck this noise\u2026 and it was the best choice I could have made for myself. Other individuals felt the same but decided to tough it out, I\u2019ve kept in contact with them and they regret their choice.",

But if I had realized a few things back around year 2-4, I would've quit 100%.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe big thing I think that's become obvious is just that, if you don't like it in year 1.5+, you're not randomly going to like it in year 3, or 4, or whenever.  In fact, I've found the opposite to be true - it gets more difficult as time goes on, which can make the enjoyment tank even worse.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people find that they start to enjoy the research more as they understand more, but honestly, I'm skeptical that this is the case for most grad students.  In my opinion, if you're really miserable early on in a phd, you should get out ASAP, because it's going to get a hundred times harder to justify quitting the longer you're there.",

I expected my mental health to get worse, and it *definitely* has lol. So I'm left with several questions for myself. Can ongoing treatment keep me *safe?* Do I have support here? Will I see improvement once I get over the bump of that first semester? Am I still in touch -- or if not, can I get *back* in touch -- with what I'm doing here, and how this gets me to that goal? \n\n\nI've been thinking on that a lot, since my mental health is pretty bad and we had someone drop my program. There's a level of \"this is awful\" I can tolerate if the environment is one where I can work through those feelings. If it becomes isolated, toxic, or it's clearly not going to get better, it's time to talk it through with a therapist and someone in my program, separately.",

      "text": "For me, the breaking point was: 0 support = suffocating suffering. \n\nAn email of \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d every four months or so from a now-retired-from-the-University dissertation chair, & nothing else, became totally insufficient. I know the process is isolating, hard, taxing, *meant* to be a challenge, yet I have come to realize also that anything *meant* to be a challenge is made challenging in ways that hamper progress, & for reasons that defy logic. As an educator, I try so hard, (which lately, given that I just withdrew from my PhD program, admittedly isn\u2019t working all that well) to support my students as a means of supporting the work they need to do to succeed in the course. I have not experienced this as a student at the graduate level. As an educator, I use community as a course theme, as a means of introducing students to its often undervalued importance, & to help ensure we\u2019re fostering one in our class. There is no such effort at the graduate level. \n\nTo have support during challenging times, when engaging difficult tasks, often equates to taking some of the weight off of those working to confront challenges. To intentionally withhold support, or act in ways that suggest someone has failed to realize it\u2019s needed, is to make the weight carried that much heavier. Eventually, I just started suffocating under the weight of it all. Since no one on my committee, in my department, in my college, in official roles at the university, had done anything to suggest there was an importance in the project, I came to accept that finishing it wasn\u2019t important after all. \n\nAnother thing that helped me finally confront this issue was asking myself to honestly answer some questions, such as: Considering my own observations & experiences of higher levels of higher education, did I really need or want to become part of that? If I can teach with a masters degree, & since I don\u2019t want to ever risk replicating the shit-show I had to trudge through for *years*, must I keep suffering through this? Do I really have to suffer, just to be? The answer on all counts is no.",

I call it academic hazing because somethings that go on really only seem to make sense if the logic behind them is \"I had to do it, so you should too\". Imo, prelim exams are one of those things I think need to be done away with or overhauled and are made needlessly difficult. There was just not as much knowledge 20-30 years ago as there is today, so to expect students to have a comprehensive overview of several topics and write a paper summarizing that knowledge in a few hours is, I think, nonsense. I think they should create a class called \"prelim exam class\" and students have the entire semester to produce their responses rather than just 8 hours or so. There is no real world context in which you will receive a question that morning and then be expected to write 40-50 pages on an 8 hour time limit.",

Part of the point is to show that you can do it on your own without having someone hold your hand in class. And in my program, we negotiated it with our advisor so that it was tailored to the individual.\n\nI got a lot out of it. But maybe your institution had it set up poorly.

Other institutions, I know people where the reading list was specified by the department. Some institutions, no specified reading list.

It got pretty bad, and I did get to a point where I was pushing through, hanging by a thread, and then having a breakdown at the end of every other Zoom meeting. That was when I took a medical leave of absence (best decision ever) to focus on mental and physical health, and it made me realize my life is not worth this degree. I didn't love my work, and my goals changed. I no longer wanted to work in academia, so the PhD wouldn't have been a means to an end. I couldn't justify subjecting myself to the struggle again and saying \"it'll get better in a few years\" because I knew it wouldn't be for anything concrete at the end. So do you absolutely need this degree to pursue what you want? Is there a way to return if you decide to leave now? \n\nI don't mean to influence your decision in any way. It's just a lot of big questions to ask yourself, and I recommend speaking to a therapist if you can. I hope you figure out what's best for you in your program!",

      "text": "I quit this summer after 4 years in a MS program (yes, you read that right). It was years of being strung along without the ability to complete my project, lack of direction and guidance, then a pandemic. I finally realized that I didn't even know how this would benefit me in the future as I no longer wanted to stay in that field. I was tired of feeling like I was accomplishing nothing while being anxious and stressed about school all the time. I had constant stomach problems. It was the best decision for my mental and physical health to leave. You should consider what your long-term goals are and the conditions you are currently in. Do the ends justify the means? Is this really what you want long-term? Where do you see this degree taking you? I think if you are already struggling to justify it, it's best to get out.",

We often work ourselves until we get to complete burnout and it takes much longer to recover from that. Take a bit and get your mind and health in balance.\n2. Honestly, if you can find someone to take you under their wing in the industry, that will probably get you further than a MSc. I know this is a tough situation. It helped me to make a pros and cons list of everything. In my case, the cons greatly outweighed the pros and that was that. It took me a long time to get to that point, but ultimately you need to do what's best for you!",

I decided to coast the program until I find a solid job (I had a scholarship for the program so I could live). \n\n\\- In the meanwhile, pretty randomly, I was asked to give a talk at a huge science facility in Switzerland. I still hadn't changed my mind about quitting, but I had to experience going to that facility just so I can casually mention giving a talk there for the rest of my life. \n\n\\- Pretty randomly after my talk, the facility person offers to fast-track my experimental proposal (from \"in theory, when we can find a facility\" to \"in a month\". Same problem. Still want to quit, but why not do an experiment and never not mention that casually for the rest of my life? \n\n\\- Few months pass and I'm still looking at cool entry level jobs at different top 500 companies, also analyzing my experimental data and playing a lot of videogames to quench depression. \n\n\\- Pretty randomly, impressed with my results, my PI wants to give a talk about my experiment \\[one of the best US universities in California\\] and needs me to come along. I have never been to California, probably will never set foot in that university outside this opportunity. So I go. \n\n.... \n\nAnd, at that time 2 years have passed in my program. In UK the sponsored programs are set to 3.5-4 years. I have more experiments lined up at \\[awesome swiss facility\\]. I am more than Half Way There. And I mentally can no longer quit. \n\nSo I survive the last 1.5 years, I survive the viva. I get the PhD. To this day I regret doing a PhD. I don't even like physics. I've been wanting to quit physics since Year 2 in undergrad. And I ended up with a PhD in Physics. Life is weird. \n\nI work at a start-up now.",

I started struggling to do basic things. I couldnt focus, i couldnt get out of bed, i slept through classes, missed deadlines, dissociated during sessions (where I was the clinician!), and overall nearly failed my first semester and my supervisors response when i told them about what was going on was \u201ctry not to dissociate/be depressed\u201d (literally!). I got into therapy and recently discovered my hormones are royally f***** and im waiting to see my doctor (which will hopefully explain the rapid decline). I barely remember most of that semester and the beginning of the next. \n\nI moved home, class load let off a bit, and i started antidepressants and kept up with therapy until i moved home. Its helped tremendously. I seriously considered quitting because of my health but wouldve had to start completely over in my program. I was less in danger of hurting myself purposefully than i was just completely checking out and failing.\n\nNo program is worth your life. Your health is priority and I wish i wouldve taken time off and really stopped to fix my health first. Dont let a program you cab restate ruin you forever.",

That should never be the answer. \n\nI can tell you from my experience that my first year was the easiest. It only got harder, more demanding, more suffocating as I got further into it. I have trouble falling asleep at night because I just spiral thinking about the lab and experiments. Lab is your PhD (if you are stem). No data, no PhD. Which means you\u2019ll be in the lab a ton. It\u2019s sad that I actually have a pretty easy lab. My PI is super laid back, super understanding. I work 40 hrs per week, no evenings. A couple weekends here and there as needed, but very rarely. I have friends who have it VERY different. PIs that make them feel bad. My PI periodically checks in asking how the work load is. Even still, because of my own personality, I feel overwhelmed because I constantly strive for success and perfection. I hate letting people down.\n\nNot sure if any of that helps. But do not feel like something \u201cbig\u201d has to happen for you to decide to stay or leave.",
