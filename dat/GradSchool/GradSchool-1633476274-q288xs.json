  "text": "I've been working with this person for about a year and they miss an opportunity to talk about anything and everything. I typically don't mind listening to talkers (I am pretty quiet), but they have begun to wear me down. \n\nIf they have something relevant to tell me about I don't mind at all but they have a habit of repeating themselves, which is what really drives me crazy. Like, they will relay the same information to me 3 times in 5 minutes but in slightly different ways with more or less information included to make it seem like a different story. \n\nGenerally speaking, I don't like the person at all, but I want to be professional and not let my personal feelings affect my research or get into the workplace.",

              "text": "This could be a sign of mild autism. If so, the best course of action is simply to be literal and direct (kindly, if possible)! Just say something like, \"I'm sorry, I don't have the mental space to talk and am not up to a conversation right now\" or \"please leave me alone right now, I need some space to myself\" and don't feel bad about saying literally that every time you need to. There's a very good chance this person is truly not able to pick up on what you think is an obvious cue. Look up the theory of the double empathy problem :)",

Don't imply any criticism to them, just take it all on yourself and tell them that you struggle sometimes to focus and you need to improve that, so you'll sometimes be wearing headphones or be uncommunicative. \n\nIf there is some way to change the layout that may help as well.

Although if I could challenge you to look from their perspective, usually people repeat themselves in different ways if they think you didn\u2019t understand what they\u2019re trying to say. You said you were pretty quite, so maybe they didn\u2019t get the response they wanted/expected? \n\nI agree that \u201cI statements\u201d are best, but as a harsher alternative, I read somewhere on Reddit that a solution to this issue was to set a timer when someone comes to chat\u2026 or you could get up and \u201cgo the bathroom\u201d for a more passive option.",

Tolerance and versatility are important life principles to learn. It\u2019s hard to become versatile with people but becoming tolerant of little nuances about people is easy.
