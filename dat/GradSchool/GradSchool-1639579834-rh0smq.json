  "text": "Hey all, not directly grad school related and yet it is and I think most of us understand why\u2026. Anyone here use an online therapy service that you like? Looking for any and all referrals. My question is of course 100% grad school and adviser related\u2026. just tired of beating myself up when I know I need someone else\u2019s help unpacking my experiences so I can figure out what to do (or not do) about them. Just sucks that grad school can\u2019t be a more supportive place focused on good science. Why does there have to be some much other BS and politics?",

I see a couples counselor through my university and that\u2019s been super helpful because grad school is hard as fuck on relationships. Having that validation helps. Also. Don\u2019t sleep on the ombudsperson! They\u2019ll help you navigate difficult institutional policies/non-policies and will help mediate conversations with difficult faculty members if you need.",

It\u2019s kind of sad that my knee jerk reaction is to distrust that they\u2019ll be willing to fairly/impartially engage in anything negative about a professor because they\u2019re part of the university hierarchy. But if it\u2019s free, it can\u2019t hurt trying. Thanks!",

I think it would create pretty serious ethical issues for them if they had any particular allegiance to professors etc. I can't speak for everywhere, but I know lots of folks in my program have felt the counseling services were helpful for them including when their stress was due to a professor behaving outrageously.",

I personally can't access my school's mental health services because of my area of study and Open Path Collective was by far the best option I could find financially. My current therapist is the best I have ever worked with and the platforms process for finding a therapist is well put together. \n\nOthers have mentioned Better Help and they are definitely the most popular on the market but I personally had a terrible experience (although I wasn't aware they offered financial aid packages for clients). Open Path was a better deal financially for me (\\~$60 per session instead of around $90 for Better Help) and also allows for more flexibility (you aren't losing money if you only do 2 sessions in one month).",
