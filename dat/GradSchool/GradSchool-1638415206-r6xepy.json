And I'm not getting any of the internships I'm applying for. And I feel like such a loser. I'm panicking. I turn 25 next month.\n\nI missed out on 2 years bc of this stupid fucking pandemic. I did some personal/professional development and ran a satirical website but now that's over and I just have no idea where to go from here. I may be pursuing a double masters and switching into the more relevant program but it probably won't help.",

The pandemic is has borked up so much for everyone, so I get your frustration, but keep in mind that you\u2019re doing really well in spite of it all. That is an accomplishment in itself, and you should be proud. \n\nI would bet that internships are similarly borked from the pandemic, so I wouldn\u2019t take it too personally. If you\u2019re worried, ask a friend to review your materials or reach out to your school\u2019s career center. That might just give you a boost. This is one of those processes that sucks because you strike out over and over, but remember that it only has to work once! \n\nI know it\u2019s easy to look forward and see some ideal vision of what you want to do in life, but the reality is that life has twists and turns and bumps. Those can take you to unexpected places, but remember that *different* isn\u2019t always *bad*. It\u2019s how we grow and it definitely keeps things interesting. Keep pursuing those goals but with an open mind for unexpected opportunities. And be kind to yourself, you\u2019re doing a good job.",

      "text": "You've already gotten some great advice here, but let me just start by saying that you are not a loser! Going to grad school is an impressive achievement. It's okay that it took you a few tries to figure out your ideal path - that's super normal! I'm only a little older than you and I've switched paths a couple times too, both professionally and within school.\n\nOn that note, I HIGHLY recommend reaching out to your school's career office, if you have one. They should be able to help you tweak your cover letters and resumes to showcase how your skills are applicable in your ideal field. It sounds like you have a background in education and writing? There's definitely plenty that you can transfer into HR and communications positions, you likely just need help learning how to \"market yourself\" (which is definitely unnatural for most people and imo more grad programs should focus on it but I digress).\n\nYou may find that you genuinely do have gaps in your skill set. So pick up an elective or two, consider adding a double-major if it's feasible, and/or look into post-grad certificate programs that could be done while you work. The possibilities really are endless, and you know your financial, mental, and opportunity cost (ie, how much do you value continuing education vs needing a salary) situation better than anyone.\n\nGood luck! You got this!",

For some perspective, I am almost 30 and only recently finished my undergrad after working in the service industry for 8+ years, didn\u2019t have a drivers license, and failed most of my high school classes, I felt I was doomed to work as a receptionist for the rest of my life. At 25 you\u2019re doing fine, and it\u2019s okay not to have all the answers. Most of the people my age just kind of fall into their jobs, and it\u2019s rarely exactly what you set out to do anyways. You may also change a lot over the next 5-10 years and find you are interested in going a different direction. \n\nThe whole \u201cyou need to know what you want to do with your life and have everything figured out by the time you graduate\u201d culture is bullshit and mostly a lie. I\u2019m honestly surprised people go to college so young, considering I would\u2019ve been in a completely different field and likely would\u2019ve hated it if I had gone right after high school. I\u2019m happy with how things turned out and feel my career path now (public health) suits me.\n\nI\u2019m in the camp that young adults should work a bit before going to school. The only reason I got my internships is because I have an extensive work history.",

I have interned for NASA, the Naval Research Lab, and the Air Force Research Lab, and even held a security clearance as part of one of those internships.\n\nEvery one of those employers who I interned with rejected me at least once prior to actually taking me, and in the case of NASA it was actually \\*four\\* times before they said yes.\n\nAnd that's to say nothing of the employers who turned me down and I never got a yes from at all, including but not limited to: Los Alamos National Lab, Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Fermilab, Brookhaven National Lab, Argonne National Lab, Oak Ridge National Lab, CERN, Columbia Nevis Labs, Sandia national labs, the Army Corps of Engineers, Army Research Lab, CIA, FBI, NSA, NGA, and DHS cyber/data science divisions\n\nDon't beat yourself up because of getting rejections from internships. A lot of time it really is just a perseverance/ numbers game.\n\nAs far as not being in the right program... your degree is not the end of the world. My dad had a career in being a fire investigator before he retired and his job involved a lot of physical forensics, combustion physics, and thermodynamics. He only has a degree in psychology.",

What I meant is just, don't worry about staying in academia and going for another degree -- especially if it's another masters, yeah keep applying. \n\nInternships are kind of scammy, the ones around me prey on undergraduates/tell new prospects that they need to \"intern\" before they decide to hire them. I don't buy it. To me it sounds like they want to pay me almost nothing while simultaneously forcing me to be dependent on them in the hopes I land a full-time position, sus. From what I have heard, if you are looking at big multinationals -- they post their job offerings at the beginning of the financial year, for some that's January, others that's the end of June. That's the best time to look and apply for full time positions. Good luck to you, don't get too down on yourself, you've gotten this far there's a reason for it, just make sure you complete what you're doing.",
