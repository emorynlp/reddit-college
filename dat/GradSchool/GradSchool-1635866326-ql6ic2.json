  "title:": "How to discuss how my PI is leaving on sabbatical even though I'm new?",
  "text": "TL;DR: New student for a PhD program straight out of undergraduate with a PI that is going to leave for a year to France, but he hasn't told anyone, what do I do?\n\nI've got an awkward situation on my hands. This Fall semester is my first semester of this new PhD program I'm a part of. My PI is a professor who apparently is notorious for being hands-off with his grad students (though I've also heard this can vary depending on the student). Being new to grad school, this freaked me out. The project is interesting and it /is/ funded, so I'm not complaining though (I say through my anxiety for the future). \n\nThe thing that's making me anxious though is the fact that according to other students in his lab (who have all been super helpful and supportive of me, thank god), he is leaving on sabbatical to teach in France (!!!) next year. I don't have many other details at the moment, but if I do, I'll add them in the comments.  It's only gotten to me because he told one other student but not all of the students in the lab collectively. I understand that the first two years before qualifying exams are mostly spent catching up on coursework and literature, but I'm still worried about what this may mean for me. I haven't fully formed my committee yet, but I do have a few options already. \n\nPlus, how the heck would this conversation go? \"Hi Dr. so and so, I heard you're dipping to a new country for a year even though you just brought me on, thanks for not telling me!\"\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Am I not as screwed as I think I am? Should I just confront him head on? Thanks in advance!",

Ironically he was actually more responsive than usual lol",

              "text": "Yeah I've been through this. My PI went on sabbatical the semester before COVID started and was on sabbatical for the entirety of 2020. I probably saw him more during COVID than I do now, because he's back teaching classes. My lab had a postdoc up until this semester, so we were doubly covered as far as research progress goes.   \n\n\nIt's really not a big deal. With big labs that have a postdoc, it's even less of a deal. Especially if your PI is technologically competent, you should be just fine.",

      "text": "It's going to depend on the professor. My PI took on first year students despite being on sabbatical in Spain for a year. It worked out really well. You should probably ask for some kind of update schedule and clear communication expectations, whether he's hands off or not.\n\nFor us, we had meetings scheduled every two weeks with a set list of talking points. We sent a document with our answers to her 24 hrs in advance of the meeting and then met at a time that worked with both time zones. \n\nHonestly, if you had to choose a year for your PI to be away, first year is the best. You'll be in classes and most of what you learn will come from older students mentoring you. Some programs limit the PI's involvement in qualifying exams anyhow. It's a big bummer if your PI goes on sabbatical during your thesis year, for example -- that's nightmare stuff.",

      "text": "I wouldn't be too concerned. The majority of your work (research/calculations/experimental stuffs) will be done with other graduate students and post docs. I presume you will meet with your PI once maybe twice a week or so virtually and life will continue as it did during the pandemic. If you insist on talking about it with him before he brings it up, just wait a little, until more of the group is discussing it so that it is at least more out in the open. As far as impacting your ability to continue your research, I would surprised if the impact was any more than minimal. \n\nAs far as timelines go. If you are in your first year, straight out of undergrad, I would guess your advisor would not be too concerned about your advisory committee or going ABD until at least your 2nd year (more likely the end of 2nd year or during 3rd). If you are ready and he is gone, you'll do it virtually as many did during the pandemic. TLDR; It shouldn't change the experience too much. If you insist on bringing up the sabbatical try not to be the first.",

Let him decide when it is the right time to tell you. He will have to, eventually. Better be on his right side.",

      "text": "Ouch. It's possible that the information is relatively new to your PI as well. (Charitably, we might extend them the benefit of the doubt, and they might not have had firm plans for their sabbatical during your application and interview process.)\n\nThat said, it's not necessarily a disaster, or even necessarily a big problem.\n\nOver the last year or so, a lot of labs have had to get used to pandemic-related restrictions on lab and building occupancy. (My old PI and lab were in a hospital-affiliated research institute, and faced some extremely stringent limits. Lab occupancy was capped at 25%, and then 50%, for a long time--and in-person group meetings are still strongly discouraged.)\n\nA lot of people have been meeting with their PIs exclusively online (MS Teams, Zoom, WhatsApp, whatever) since March 2020. We've all had a lot of practice with this, now.\n\nSimilarly, in many labs the PI (especially if they are later in their careers) is very hands-off anyway. Training on new methods and equipment is carried out by staff technicians, postdocs, or senior graduate students. The PI isn't standing over your shoulder when you're at the bench; they're waiting back in the office to talk about the results of the experiment.\n\nFinally, supervisors leave their labs from time to time. Sabbaticals, moving to new universities, sudden retirements (due to health problems...or scandals), private sector job offers, sudden death (heart attack or hit by gravel truck), etc. Universities are 'used to' this issue.\n\nThere is probably a more-or-less-formal process for establishing a co-supervision or co-PI role (perhaps for one of the other members of your supervisory committee) so that there is someone local for you to talk to and work with.\n\nOverall, the most important thing is establishing and maintaining clear lines of communication - now and next year - so that you and your PI remain 'on the same page' even while you're in separate countries. Find out what their plans are for regular lab meetings (weekly? Twice monthly?) and opportunities to 'check in' with individual lab members. Manage expectations of both parties to minimize surprises.",

At many institutions, it's not a guaranteed thing. \n\nAnd very often, faculty don't find out until spring semester before the following year whether or not they've been approved.\n\nIn that case, it would actually be premature to get grad students all in an uproar over something that might not even happen.",

We message each other on WhatsApp nearly every day, we see each other in project meetings over zoom at least once a week. We never really had one on one meetings though. If you\u2019re in the US, the time difference really isn\u2019t a problem. Just don\u2019t expect to hear a response any time after like 2pm until the next day. My advisor has left for shorter periods (usually the summers) to teach and do research in Saudi Arabia, France, etc. and it\u2019s always been fine. \n\nShameless plug for the program, but you can use your PI\u2019s sabbatical to your advantage to get in contact with some folks in France to do research over there. I\u2019m funded through the Chateaubriand fellowship, which is a program funded through the French office of science and tech to strengthen research ties between the two countries. They sponsor american PhDs for 4-9 months to do research in a french lab, so you can always utilize your PI\u2019s sabbatical as a way to get your foot in the door for other cool opportunities :)",
