  "text": "I\u2019m a 23 year old woman and most of the people in my program and my classes have at least 5 years on me. They have so much more life and real world experience. And yeah I know it\u2019s because they\u2019re older. But I still feel like I\u2019m not as smart as anyone else here and that I shouldn\u2019t have even been admitted to grad school. Any other young women feeling this way? I\u2019m in a mostly male dominated field as well (politics and international relations, though it\u2019s been changing lately)",

      "text": "Imposter syndrome is extremely common in postgraduate students (and academia in general). A lot of your classmates will be feeling the same, even if that's not how they project themselves, and I think this gets amplified for women in male dominated fields.\n\nThere are no easy answers but I did do a YouTube video a while back with some strategies that might help [https://youtu.be/RaC5R1yzuMw](https://youtu.be/RaC5R1yzuMw)\n\nClearly the institution thought you were smart & capable enough, and you will have different knowledge and experiences to your classmates that will help you - even if you don't feel that way at the moment.",

      "text": "Environmental policy PhD here! I started my PhD at 22 and had the same story with my cohort. I remember on the first day of our seminar class, the director of our program asked us to introduce ourselves and our research. Everyone else spent at least five minutes talking. I talked for one and he answered by saying \"ok...what else?\"\n\nIt takes time, but you will get to a place where you feel marginally more confident (I don't want to say it goes up to 100, because I can't say that for myself yet lol). I recommend pursuing projects and opportunities that can speak to your credibility. For example, I received a fellowship with a well-known organization last year, and it has really changed the way that my advisor and others see me, but most importantly, I feel so much better about where I'm heading. \n\nI hope this helps - PM me if you want to talk more! Good luck.",

      "text": "It is definitely real. I had no research experience going into my STEM master's program and was quite insecure about that and my inexperience with STEM-related coursework in general.  It helps knowing the vast majority of other students (women, at least) also feel that way. I have had so many conversations with people in my program who were insecure about coming back to school after working or starting families, coming straight from undergrad, having research experience in a different field etc. \n\nSurround yourself with people who affirm you, and if someone puts their intelligence/capabilities down, reassure them too! The biggest thing that helped me was being reminded that my (and your) program only lets in students they know belong there. They want a high retention rate and good job placements, and they want students who are passionate and capable so they'll do well in the program. They put a lot of thought into admitting you. I was just an okay student undergrad and didn't take any classes relevant to my field, but I did really well my first year, even with high level math and programming stuff I was totally intimidated by at first. \n\nWorking through feelings of inadequacy/incompetence with people helped me, because this really is a universal experience even among your smartest and most together seeming peers. Giving and receiving positive feedback in various forms in general also helps. I always like telling people a comment they made in class was important or that I appreciate their understanding of a concept I'm still learning, and getting nice comments from TAs and my mentor/professors has helped me feel way more capable than my grades alone.",

I did all this stuff and used XYZ years and I\u2019m right where they are.\u201d Sometimes that fear manifests itself as putting down people who \u201clack experience\u201d and sometimes it\u2019s more outwardly kind. \n\nImposter phenomenon is a real treat.",

I felt the exact same way you did.\n\nI'm now 30 in another program and the roles have now somewhat reversed, where some of my cohort mates are in their early 20s and in their eyes I am perceived as \"the more experienced adult\".\n\nI promise you... there was a reason why you were admitted -- even if you don't feel as experienced or as qualified as the rest of your colleagues. If you got into your program, you're qualified. \ud83d\ude0a",
