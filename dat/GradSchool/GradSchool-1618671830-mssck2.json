One thing that helped me was journaling an energy inventory, giving the things I do a +1-10 if they add energy, or -1-10 if they deplete my energy. I daily sum up the things I do, and if I maximize this number I wake up better and have more energy to work. Could help you sort of 'game' your energy levels.",

      "text": "I feel ya so hard and I think writing is in general just such a vexing experience. First and foremost, sending you lots of hugs! \n\nI\u2019m writing up my qualifying exam report for candidacy now as well - so, not a thesis but still lots of writing involved. I am definitely finding myself struggling more this time than I did with my undergrad honours thesis because now I also have to juggle experiments and going in and out of the lab. So for the past month every bit of spare waiting time I get between expts I am either reading, writing, in a seminar, doing slides, or getting ready for my next timepoint.\n\nI think having long, uninterrupted stretches of time to write, ala my undergrad days, worked a lot better for me because I find my inspiration / flow for writing vacillates between two states : being hyper-inspired and having so many thoughts I have to put words to paper and those are the moments i feel on a roll banging out page after page; and the second state of feeling completely constipated (for lack of a better word lol) in my writing - nitpicking over every choice of vocabulary and grammar and being incapable of putting any thought down. I write and backspace the same thought for 10 minutes for a point I can\u2019t quite get across because it just doesn\u2019t look *quite* right and sometimes I get frustrated enough I shut down and just take a break because my brain is just oversaturated. \n\nWhen my schedule is such that I don\u2019t get those long stretches of thinking / pondering / writing / free to empty out my brain and do nothing time, I feel as if I need to be really productive during those \u2018free\u2019 hours I get so as to not waste it. But realistically, I just don\u2019t think every writing session will be turbo charged and that is ok! I fully agree with another comment here : you just need to do a little bit consistently everyday. Just 5 mins, just 3 lines, just *something*. Small things add up and bring you closer to your end goal just a little bit everyday and that progress, not perfection, is what will get you there to the finish line.\n\nAnother comment I saw that really helped and I\u2019m going to utilise whenever I feel stuck from now on is the one on spew drafting! I\u2019m a *chronic* editor so almost every sentence I get out I want to make sure it\u2019s perfect. This gets real frustrating real fast when I\u2019m going back and forth between all my diff tabs, papers, figures etc to try to come up with the ONE sentence, and to be bogged down by all the paralysis by analysis thoughts of \u2018is this where a hyphen or a semi colon goes?\u2019 / \u2018should I move this part here and change the order?\u2019 is so jarring to the flow I had going on. \n\nA lot of the times there IS a thought, it\u2019s just not flowing out right or the words aren\u2019t being threaded together immediately - but put it out there anyway. I\u2019ve realized it takes less brain effort to edit than to create a thought and sentence. Your work is going to be read and edited multiple times anyways so the first time does not need to be perfect. The first draft is meant to be messy and confusing - but having that first draft is the key and the backbone to all future revisions. \n\nEmbrace the mess and good luck!!!! You got this.",

      "text": "A few things that have really helped me:\n\n1. set up check in dates or soft deadlines with your advisor if you haven't already. Make them realistic (not too strict) and flexible. Do your best to follow them regardless of how much you've gotten done. Just be held accountable for your writing to somebody (but not in the guilt sense, the supporting sense. If your advisor is not this kind of person maybe another grad student, partner or friend can help?)\n2. Set up a way to track your progress. One of the best things I've done for my writing is sign up for Write Track (it's free you just need an account and there are many other websites/apps like this one, too): [https://writetrack.davidsgale.com/](https://writetrack.davidsgale.com/pls/apex/f?p=228:LOGIN::::::) You can put in a deadline you'd like to get x words written by, and each day you can track your progress. It will also adjust your daily goal needed to meet that larger goal each time you add a word count to it. This has been so helpful to me because if I'm feeling overwhelmed with how much I have to write I just have to look at these daily average goals. Instead of needing 7,500 words by x day, I instead need to write 200-300 words a day, or something like that. Totally different perspective.\n3. What are your goals after you finish your thesis? What would you like to do? I am looking forward to moving out of this terrible apartment in this terrible town I am in, so that has been motivating to me! Though you may have more optimistic goals than I do. :)",

I was in the exact same position this time last year with my first-year thesis.\n\nStart small. Create the overarching chapter structure, edit the table of contents, throw in a few bullet-point notes here and there with thoughts on what you might insert into the sections themselves. Gloss over your data and scribble down in the thesis document itself whatever happens to catch your eye.\n\nBeyond that, try establishing a strict schedule and set location where you do nothing - and I mean nothing - but sit at your computer and try to work. For me, it's waking up at 7:30 every morning, making my coffee, putting my phone in another room, turning on [Coldturkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/), and sifting over articles until I feel inspired enough to vomit out some words on the page. Need a break? By all means take it, but don't do it in the same place you work. Want to decompress with a game? Do it in another room, taking your laptop with you if you have to. Want to watch Youtube or Netflix for a bit? Do what you gotta do - but make sure you *do it somewhere else*.\n\nI'm not saying these methods are a magic pill, but I managed to crank out the entirety of my 79-page thesis last year from complete scratch - research data and all - in one month by doing this. It was one of the worst experiences of my life, and I highly recommend you start trying to establish this sort of working schedule now to avoid it, but I ended up getting highest marks and obtained my first-year diploma with highest honors. There's no panacea for this sort of thing, but it's surmountable.\n\nYou got this.",

Anything will do\n5) instead of writing a full paragraphs and complete sentences with source, it might be better to write it as form of points for each paragraph such as: \n- potato is important \n- it is important because A and B \n- I read in one article that certain vitamin help certain things \n- some people don't think it's important \n- I also remember reading another article for people who stopped eating potato for a study \n- I don't remember the results but it was wired \n\nYou can share the point with your supervisor as they can help remove or add point or direct you to different direction without you needing to actually write things.",

A few things have helped me:\n\n- writing out the sections (feel free to adapt from other people's dissertations if you don't know where to start)\n\n- making outlines/writing in point form (I judge my writing a lot less when I do this and I don't stop to edit it as much, which makes me go faster)\n\n- pull together research notes for each section and add ideas about what to include\n\n- use the Pomodoro method as someone mentioned\n\n- find a writing group, the social community/pressure helps me a lot\n\n- join a writing retreat if your school offers one (I just did one for two days this week, it was awesome)\n\n- talk to the writing centre at your school if you have one\n\n- send your advisor sections to review if they're okay with that (I wish my advisor let me do this, they wanted to see the whole thing at once so it took a while to get everything put together)\n\nGood luck!",

If I'm really stuck, I use the papers as references to see how they formatted their background information and how they section their topics. You always want to remember that your thesis is like a big argument, and you want to prove something. Asking yourself who, what, when, where, why, and how questions help with writing too, and you know you made a good argument when all the points are satisfied.",

The looming deadline of getting kicked out paired with a *reliable* writing buddy trying to graduate on the same timeline, as well as the reluctant acceptance that this didn't have to be my opus is what got me through. My advice to past me might be helpful for you:\n\n-Write it as if it were a term paper. That is your primary draft. \n\n-Let your advisor/committee determine your content edits after you've given them a draft to look at. Don't try to make your term paper/draft perfect or profound before they see it. It's already better than you think.\n\n-Find a reliable buddy to check in with daily who can be support, bounce questions and ideas off of, help with setting goals and celebrating acheivements. This might take several attempts to find the right person but it's worth the effort. \n\n-Once it's done you won't regret it if it's shittier than you wanted it to be. Nobody else cares. (Full disclosure I didn't intend to stay in academia so ymmv).\n\nYou're in your own way right now, and that's just silly. Go get what you've already earned!",

For me, having someone to work with who was also in my program was really helpful, and if that is an option for you I suggest posting on any platforms you may have. \n\nSince programs and requirements and social dynamics vary so much I think it was helpful to have someone in my program who was under the same expectations and I didn't get distracted by other ways of doing it (like i had for years when I took every thesis workshop that existed). Maybe someone in the department can point you towards someone else who is writing to reach out to? \n\nI also joined the gradbuddies \n[discord](https://discord.gg/t8DqxJbB) and found that to be a supportive group. I would post there asking for a regular writing/check in buddy. (Structure and consistancy with one person I found to be more helpful than the group check ins)\n\nOne more thought is maybe you could start your own group. Set up a zoom or reserve a library room for a regular time/place, and encourage others to join you.\n\nIf nothing else, I'll be your buddy - I'm not thesising anymore, but I'm still working on other things.",

Even if you\u2019re on a streak of getting started and going for a while, don\u2019t stress if one session you end up only  working for the 5\n- Set a timer for your breaks that you think is fair and reasonable based on how you feel that day. It\u2019s completely up to you, some days you may feel like you need a longer break and that\u2019s fine, just try to stick to your desired study-break time ratio you decided on\n- When you are working, make sure to dedicate that time solely for work. Remove your phone and any other distractions from your environment. If you have the urge to check a text or something, remind yourself you can once the timer is up\n\nBest of luck!",
