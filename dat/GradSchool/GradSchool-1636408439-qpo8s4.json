  "text": "I already know it's going to be weird starting on an off semester, but I have an apartment lined up and I'm hoping to be moved before classes start. I got an offer last Thursday for a UF master's project on human dimensions so at least I won't have to do super intense fieldwork outside!\n\nI'm mostly worried about the transition from one school to another (did this 3 times in my undergrad so not sure why this is wigging me out). And have barely a clue what this kind of research will look like outside of educational outreach and formulating surveys. In my head, it'll be 90% reading and citing papers and talking to people, but how do I do that for 2 years?\n\nI'm assuming coursework will be pretty similar to my undergrad as I've already taken a handful of graduate level classes and seen the changes they make for graduate vs undergraduate students. Even my professors have told me not to sweat the coursework and that it's all about the research. \n\nAny advice for a first gen graduate student? My field seems so removed from everything else here that I'm lost on what advice will actually be applicable to me. I'm very excited, but also very nervous! I already have a plan to make a \"stress tent\" for my office, just a tent full of blankets and pillows for when I get overwhelmed and need a break.",
