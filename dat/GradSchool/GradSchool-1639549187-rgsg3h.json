  "text": "So my semester is wrapping up and basically I failed 4/5 classes and I oddly feel okay. I think I was starting to experience burnout. I finished undergrad in may and started grad school 2 weeks later\u2026I still want to finish grad school but I don\u2019t think the accelerated program is for me. The thought of going part time use to make me so irritable cause I don\u2019t want to draw out school, but it might be in my best interest. I\u2019m excited to engage in my hobbies guilt free! but nervous for that advisor email about me failing.",

Part time is still better than no time. And no time and moving with life and career is better than bitterly clinging to a degree program and faculty that kills you inside to complete/appease. Good luck in you decision. Either way your future is yours to write",
