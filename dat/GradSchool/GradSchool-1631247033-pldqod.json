  "text": "So im a senior currently in IT in a no ranked school with a gpa of 2.7 no internships yet and no job offers. I applied to transfer to a better a know school with much more connections and career fairs and got accepted but they basically gave me sophomore credits, so my question is should i transfer due to better job outcomes or stay at my current school and graduate with hopefully a 3.0 and try to go to grad school. Thx",
