  "text": "Say a stipend for a PhD program is $30k/year. Is that the absolute maximum you can earn in income through your program even with TA/RA-ships? How about fellowships, outside grants, scholarships, etc.? \n\nI guess what I am asking is in what cases does additional funding end up being supplementary income on top of a stipend (30k stipend + 10k TA = $40k annual?), and how often does that occur? Or am I way off?",

This was on top of all fees and tuition paid for.\n\nI recently switched to an industry fellowship which pays 55k/6months and replaced my RA stipend.\n\nI think most universities discourage taking on extra work beyond the RA/TA but I have done babysitting during the summer to get a little extra cash, and I know other grad students who. have taken on TAing extra summer courses or working part time at the Outdoor Rec program to help supplement their income.\n\nI think your best bet for making more money is to just apply to scholarships/fellowships that offer a higher stipend or just give you extra money not tied to a \"stipend\"",

My program doesn't have TAships and our contract discourages or bans most kinds of part time work as we are expected to be in the lab full-time.

My university requires some paperwork to allow students to work two assistantships, maybe some universities may not allow it (not sure). \n\nI also recently won two scholarships, so you aren\u2019t excluded from applying to university scholarships if you have an assistantship. \n\nI have colleagues who work part-time jobs and because they jobs are within their field of study, the university counts the jobs as internships that they need to fulfill in order to graduate. So you could even work a paying job and still have it work towards your degree. \n\nHope this helps",

      "text": "Each program and each university has a different way of approaching this.  This is the framework I look at it.\n\n1. RA Stipend - This is the base funding you get (commonly comes with tuition support, etc.).  Around 34k/year or so at my institution (different institutions have different pricing).   If you get a big fellowship then you'll probably make a little bit more, but not really.  This is usually where the tuition waiver money comes from.  \n2. Scholarships/Fellowships - Some of them can be full coverage (can replace your original stipend), but smaller ones are just pure cash (I got 2.5k and 5k scholarships that helped a lot)\n3. Funding Agency Work - My funding agency wanted me to work for them full-time for a summer.  I had them pay for my housing, my full-time salary (2x our hourly wage for RA-ship), and... well... everything.  Expensed it through the university admin office.  I made an extra 8k or so that summer.\n4. Part-time job - Realistically you don't have the time.  But my old roommate worked as a bouncer at a local bar and got some extra beer money from it (and some fun memories).\n5. Teaching Positions - Teaching a first-year seminar class can sometimes give you extra cash (some re-adjust your RA stipend to hit the 34k but other students have luck and it's money on top of their stipend).\n6. Others - There are other opportunities like participating in human studies (Transportation Engineering at our university has a driving simulator where test subject (current study is offering 100 dollars for 4x 1 hour long appointments across a month) get paid cash.\n\nI got the RA stipend, small scholarships/fellowships, and funding agency work.  I'm definitely more fortunate than some of my colleagues and friends who don't get these opportunities.  But at the end of the day you're not in grad school to make money, you're there to get a degree.  These are just opportunities to keep you alive until you graduate and get a real job.",
