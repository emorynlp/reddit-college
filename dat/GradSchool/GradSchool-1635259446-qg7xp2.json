She was a board certified surgeon and ER physician, professor of medical ethics, and generally one of the smartest people I have ever met in any context. She would relate my focus of neuroscience with non-brain diseases in a way that was super insightful and helpful. Or she would bust out some St. Thomas Aquinas. Or Telliard. She was my role model. She passed during my first year, but she was the first person I told when I got into my program. She always wanted another doctor in the family and was willing to settle with a neuroscientist.\n\nSorry for the heavy story. She's just been on my mind today.",

My field is one where I can *vaguely* tell them what I'm working on, though, and I appreciate that it lets me think about how to communicate ideas with a non-academic audience, which is important to me.\n\n\nWhat I found as I've come into grad school, though, is that those intellectually fulfilling conversations don't *need* to be with close friends and family. In fact, they may even be better when they're with someone who isn't as attached to you. For academic interests, I talk to my cohort buddy or my current supervisor, and that fills the need for intellectual engagement. Then, when I visit family, I can just enjoy our time together and appreciate what our relationship *does* give, versus what it does not give.",

      "text": "As an undergraduate, I can't speak to the graduate level. However, I find that I am very fulfilled when I talk to my family about what I have learned and how I am applying it. That is, I already have a close-knit family and I try to share as much about myself to them as I can. There are plenty of times when I have let some niche 3D modeling term like, \"parametric\" slip out and then be forced to explain what it means in detail.\n\n*If a 3D object is \"parametric\", it basically means that I am able to make it stretch and flex to my liking (often times, with nothing more than a click of the mouse)!*\n\nAs the others have said, I think it is best to look forward to explaining your research in such a way that makes sense to them and a way that makes it applicable in their lives. When I discuss my love of 3D scanning and 3D modeling, I always try to overlay how I will be implementing it into Heritage Preservation (the field I am ultimately striving towards). Then I try and illustrate what that would mean to them in terms of how they would get to enjoy our shared heritage (an ancient temple, etc.). Perhaps they could experience something I make someday through a VR experience.\n\nAdditionally, my father has been flipping houses and doing renovations for as long as I can remember. So, being able to draft plans for him using my 3D architectural drafting software is just one more way that I am able to help him while enriching my knowledge in the field.",
