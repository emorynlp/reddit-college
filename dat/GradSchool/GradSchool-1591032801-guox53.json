  "text": "A bill was proposed this morning by a few senators to restrict graduate student visas from China who are doing research in STEM fields at all institutions in the United States: https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1371  \n\n\nNo matter what your stance is on this issue, one thing is clear: Some of the most influential and talented researchers at our institutions are from China. Barring them is simply xenophobic.  \n\n\nThere is a petition going around right now to go against this bill -- if you are willing to sign it, please do. It takes 30 seconds.  \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIu1jbAfB5qFGkV3I7rpEAo0kwsUb8CpzZ_6Nu-CoKeul4PQ/viewform",

This should just be a first step.\n\nTO BE CLEAR: Yes, these students are every bit as talented as American students. Yes, they contribute a shit ton of research work. And to the economy overall.\n\nBut universities and supervisors don't take on [more and more](http://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Importance-of-International-Students.NFAP-Policy-Brief.October-20171.pdf) students from non-Western countries out of the goodness of their hearts. They love doing so, because many can be 'nudged' to work very long hours for very little money. Not only during their PhD, but also as post-docs afterwards - yay! Additionally, quitting is not an economically viable option for most, and supervisors know this.\n\nWhere companies outsource to low wage countries, universities just bring in the more cost-effective labour they need. After all, a PhD in STEM is at max 30% educational and 70% work like any other. Working conditions for PhDs have always been subpar, but that's exactly why we shouldn't allow universities to continuously put downward pressure on them. A steady inflow of cheap(-ish) labour makes it far too easy for them. When corporations do this, they get exposed and everyone talks about (just think of Amazon and their warehouses). Why should universities get away with it?",

Not a SINGLE FUCKING POST. Especially given that we're in the middle of a civil rights era ... not one post. Y'all are trash ass white supremacists using Chinese to cover that fact.",

The job prospects are very poor as well. There's very little protection against abusive PIs. There are very few domestic American students that stay in the system; most leave as soon as they can, white or black or Hispanic or Asian. The research infrastructure is then propped up by international students who are willing to endure the system in exchange for visa and possible legal immigration to a better life than what their home country can provide.

Who the hell do you think you are?\n\nThis is most certainly not what they're trying to say. The education system (K-12) fails black and brown students in many ways, including cultivating an interest in science. Children aren't scientists at 12, but cultivating their intellectual curiosity and interest in science around this age can be incredibly important for their futures. As a daughter of non-scientist parents without college degrees, the science education I received in K-12 was critical in developing my interest in science. \n\nThe school I attend for my PhD program actively recruits black and brown students, and makes use of certain programs to do so as early as their junior year in high school. We bring students in from city public schools for a summer and get them exposed to working in actual biomedical labs. We also have summer REU programs from which our grad program actively recruits black and brown students. Once they enroll in our PhD program, there is a specific program built to help ensure success of underrepresented minority students. We are by no means perfect, but we are trying at our institution. My only point is that it takes a lot of work early on in a student's life to cultivate an interest in pursuing a STEM PhD. And I haven't even outlined our outreach efforts to local city public elementary schools and junior high. \n\n>Another completely ignorant statement. Most minority students are making more money in grad school than their parents. The ignorance is astounding. Try again. \n\nAgain, I think you're misunderstanding what the commenter was trying to say. It is well-known that international students, regardless of race, are more vulnerable than their US citizen peers in STEM graduate school. Yes, they may make more money than their parents. This doesn't excuse the fact that professors (whether consciously or unconsciously) often push them to work insane hours. International students have no recourse when this happens. If they complain, the professor can simply kick them out of the lab, risking deportation. If a domestic student complains and is kicked out of lab, they still have the privilege of maintaining the life they've built in the US.\n\nDialogue is important. Often times there can be miscommunications. If we jump to conclusions and call someone a white supremacist, I'm pretty sure that usually shuts down the dialogue, and nothing is accomplished. \n\nI have done my best in what little spare time graduate school has afforded me to do my part in science outreach for minority students in the city of St. Louis. I felt a personal responsibility as someone being funded by the federal government to do so. This is why I felt compelled to respond here.",

Minority students are ROUTINELY thrown out of PhD programs because they're used as a DE&I props in the same way you describe. The institutions that do care are so few and far between and this week made that abundantly clear.\n2. Again your very silly assumption that these CHILDREN do not have an interest in science is RACIST. They are being PUSHED out of STEM at the UNDERGRADUATE  level. Read that again. The UNDERGRADUATE level. Most students know in high school that they want to take a science and math classes. In undergraduate courses they're faced down by your racist and sexist kin and peers.\n\nPeople like you are the problem because you spout platitudes about \"where\"  the focus should be but you don't know anything about the problem. These kids don't need EXTRA help they need the SAME education others get. Also I don't care what you have to say about your department because I know that if I talk to those students and hires they'll have very interesting things to say. \n\nAnd you know damn well the person above nor yourself don't give a fuck about those little black latinx and native kids not studying science.

I said that simply because the city public school system is FAILING THEM in not providing adequate science education. I was fortunate in that I had a great science education in high school, which did influence my choices in undergrad and beyond.\n\nI did my best to try to clarify where this person is coming from, particularly regarding international students.

Denial of visas would be the new norm, with very minimal exceptions as outlined in the link from the main post. It is not 'feel-good' legislation and it is not a precursor to anything; there is nothing beyond this. \n\nThis cannot be allowed to happen. I'm dismayed at what I've seen in the most recent reddit threads about this. Do you ever talk to your Chinese colleagues? You know that China does not allow dual citizenship, right? I know many people who plan to give up their Chinese citizenship as soon as they have the option to. Poorer people don't have the option of coming to the US for undergrad, but see grad school as a path to US citizenship and \"the American dream\". \n\nI am an American PhD student in Canada. Canada already has all of the strong Iranian students. Don't make US schools weaker by giving up most of the Chinese students too. Already visas can be denied for almost no reason - we don't need more restrictions, even in the form of Trump's more reasonable order.",

Everyone agrees, it's time to do something about this shitshow. Move supplylines out of China, prioritize minimization theft of valuable IP, and stop allocating our hardearned capital in Chinese companies (which *all* commit fraud to varying extents, according to analytic firms like Muddy Waters). Also, this will hopefully tighten the supply of grad students available to US universities somewhat and put everyone *already* in the US in better bargaining positions. There's talent here. University departments are just going to have to pay more for it",

This is statecraft.  \n  \nI do agree though, the executive order is overinclusive (restricts student visas to those who wouldn't have stolen IP) and underinclusive (doesn't restrict student visas from being given to people from countries other than China which also commit IP theft, like Russia). But that's just the nature of government action. We owe case-by-case due process to US citizens, permanent residents, and legal residents. There is no due process requirement or guarantee constitutionally nor statutorily when it comes to who to let into the country and to whom to extend American legal protection in the first place.",

International students and postdocs, especially from Asia, have traditionally provided highly skilled labor that enabled the US research enterprise to flourish. Allowing broad government hurtles such as this bill to proceed is extraordinarily detrimental not only to scientific pipelines in the US, but also to the reputation of the country as a welcoming destination for international collaborations.

A large group of average people are getting punished for the actions of a minority. If 80% of the protesters are peaceful but 20% are engaging in violence, should the state ban all protests? In addition, you should also look into the cases of some of the people arrested for ties with the PRC - there are many American citizens involved as well. \n\n> I disagree with the ambiguous criteria, but this is a major issue. United States colleges and researchers do not need corrupt Chinese influences.\n\nIt is a major problem. That much I agree. But there are better ways of dealing with it than a blanket ban.

I'm sure such statistics probably exists in the intelligence community, but it's not publicized (or at least I can't find any).

If a small number of businesses are reporting theft conducted by a small number of people, then all the Chinese immigrants must be banned. So if a small number of businesses are looted by a small number of violent people, then all protests must be banned.\n\n> If 20% of the nation was engaging in violence, it would be anarchy and a civil war. 20% of America is 70 million people, or more than the total of the armies of the USSR, Germany, US, and China in WW2.

How much brain drain from the US to PRC is worth that tradeoff?

                  "text": "From [FP](https://foreignpolicy.com./2020/05/13/united-states-cant-afford-turn-away-chinese-talent/), which cited the [Center for Security and Emerging Technology](https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/Keeping-Top-AI-Talent-in-the-United-States.pdf):\n\n> So far, the United States is winning that competition by a landslide. Contrary to the perception that Chinese graduates of U.S. institutions usually leave, the proportion of Chinese Ph.D. students who remain in the United States after graduation remains high. Data collected by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology estimate that **91 percent of Chinese Ph.D. students in artificial intelligence stay in the United States for at least five years after graduating\u2014despite the challenges that securing visas already involves.** The United States can reap benefits to its innovation ecosystem from welcoming these students.\n\nIn fact, many Chinese students are now choosing not to stay not because they don't want to, but because of more restrictive visa and immigration policies in the US, fewer job opportunities, and better pay in China. Why stay in a place where you're starting to feel unwelcomed? According to one [survey](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20180531154955271):\n\n> The number of Chinese students seeking to settle overseas after graduating from universities abroad is dropping, amid stricter immigration policies in many countries and continued strong growth fuelling job opportunities in China, says a survey released as the United States reportedly considers limiting the length of visas for certain categories of Chinese students.\n\n> The 2018 Chinese Students Overseas Study White Paper, published on 22 May by New Oriental Vision Overseas, a major private education service provider, found that 46% of students had no intention of immigrating after graduation \u2013 up from 39% in 2017 and 35% in 2016.\n\n> Returning students are increasingly being wooed with a range of government incentives. Many in science and technology fields are offered generous domestic research funding and opportunities.\n\nJob opportunity and money is a major motivating factor. HKUST's (where I did my master's) former President moved to Saudi Arabia because the Saudis offered him a massive package, despite the fact that he was already well-paid in Hong Kong.\n\n> Is it enough to justify the cost of educating a large portion of them for 7+ years if they turn around and take that knowledge home? How much brain drain from the US to PRC is worth that tradeoff?\n\nIf the US can offer students the same pay and perks the Chinese government is offering them, don't you think they would stay? If the data I posted above tells us anything, it's that Chinese students want to stay but feel they'd have more of a future in China. I'm an American. I want to stay in the US after graduating and find a job here, but if I can get more pay in another country, then I'll take my knowledge and expertise with me elsewhere. And it's not like these students don't contribute to anything while they're here. No student has an obligation to remain here after graduation because they either paid tuition or they made contributions while here on a stipend/scholarship.\n\n> My experience with Chinese students is that (1) they are not interested in integrating, (2) they are not interested in US citizenship because it would strip their PRC citizenship, and (3) many of them actually want to go home. This is an anecdote based on my interaction over many years with these students and shouldn't be taken as data but it's what I've experienced.\n\nThis might be true for undergraduates, but for grad students I feel like it's less of a problem. For instance not all of their research group members/cohorts are from China and these are the people they'd have to interact on a regular basis. Besides, it's not just the Chinese that are guilty of this. Korean students, for instance, also tend to bunch up together.\n\n> Why do you think that getting rid of a few grad students would negatively impact research in the US? There is no shortage of motivated people willing to come to the US to study and if doing a PhD has taught me anything, it's that \"intelligence\" isn't the personal quality that will determine whether or not you are successful.\n\nHave you read the bill? This is not just \"getting rid of a few grad students.\" This is banning Chinese grad students from coming to the US to study STEM altogether. Projects will be delayed or cancelled. The next US Nobel Prize winner might not exist. A groundbreaking discovery that might have been attributed to the US might now belong to another country. The implications of this is much more than you're willing to admit. If we suddenly ban Mexican farmer laborers, where are we suddenly going to find replacements?\n\n> I think a lot of people studying at US institutions are very comfortable with the lifestyle and resources that come along with the US being the number one superpower but are suddenly extremely uncomfortable with how their freedoms are provided to them when the reality of protecting our position in the world comes up.\n\nNo, we're extremely uncomfortable with singling out a group just because that group has some bad eggs mixed in. You realize the CCP and Trump is literally using this exact same argument to justify their suppression of protests? No one is saying IP theft is not a issue and that there isn't Chinese students involved, but not all of them are engaged in IP theft. It's extremely easy for you to sit there and say \"there is nothing wrong with this\" because you're not who they're after.",

                      "text": "While I appreciate the numbers you provided (not sarcastic) that really is one subdiscipline of one field. Your broader point seems to come back to the same thing: if another country can pay better, students will go where the money is and I'm not interested in having these people in the country to begin with. I want the people immigrating here to want to become Americans first and foremost and not have the decision of where their loyalty lies be some percentage of their salary. There is very little to convince me that we won't be able to replace these people with ones who are actively seeking out the chance to become Americans and/or are domestic students already. \n\n\nAdditionally, I never mentioned IP theft at all. I see this as a strategic move to protect our long-term scientific interests rather than something as short-sighted as protecting intellectual property. I am interested in starving the CCP of as many talented engineers as possible and denying them a US education and right now this seems to be on the right path. If there were instead a way to have them signing an agreement that would dissolve their loyalty to and citizenship with the PRC in exchange for coming here to study and being given residency and citizenship, I'd be all for it but that isn't the choice we are being given.",

                          "text": "If you want people to stay, you have to give them a reason to stay. Poor job prospects, strict visa and immigration policies, Trump's constant \"America first\" rhetoric, and growing anti-China sentiments that is spilling into racism is not doing any favors in keeping them here. You can't blame them for leaving when they don't feel welcomed here and China is offering them more. By your logic, India should stop sending their engineers and programmers to the US because that represents brain drain and is bad for India's growth. Your \"us versus them\" logic is really misguided. Forcing people to be American and rejecting them if they don't want to be American? Is that what America is about? If students are paying tuition and/or contributing to projects while studying in the US, then they've made their contributions. Grad students pay taxes. They spend money on rent and food and entertainment, etc. contributing to our economy while they're here. What else do they owe to this country? Whether or not they want to stay or move is their choice. America is a country that provides them with that choice and that is why this country is great.\n\nI find your sentiments very scary and unnerving. People can only come here to study if they agree to give up their previous citizenship and agree to be American? How is that any different from what the CCP is doing (giving people money if they agree to work for China and be loyal to China)? Do you want America to go down the same way as China? Or are you just targeting Chinese people? Racist much?",

So the solution being explored here is to give extremely broad authority which will *theoretically* only be used in support of a very narrow goal. I understand the policy motivation. I also understand the concern. It's a tricky issue. The Trump administration hasn't proven itself to be a fan of nuance so this type of approach isn't surprising at all to me.",
