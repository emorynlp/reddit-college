  "title:": "For those having trouble staying motivated while writing your thesis/dissertation, I thought I would share something that has helped me tremendously...",
  "text": "I see a lot of posts about people lacking motivation to write or push forward with their theses, dissertations, and manuscripts.  I\u2019ve been there, and could barely bring myself to begin writing my PhD research proposal at all my first semester.  It\u2019s mentally draining when you know you should be writing, but you keep stalling anyway.  \n\nA while back I saw a post where a PhD student kept a word log of his dissertation writing progress and made a histogram/line chart with it. I thought it was a cool idea so I decided to do the same just for fun. I can\u2019t post pictures to this thread but I\u2019ll provide a link to my example.\n\nHowever, what I have discovered is that this running word count has provided a tangible source of motivation and inspiration. Every day you write, even if you only add a single sentence to your manuscript, the line goes up.  It allows me to keep track of highly productive days, see that I\u2019m capable of writing significant chunks at a time, and helps me stay on track with daily writing goals. \n\nThis is just something that has been useful for me personally. Everyone works differently and are motivated by different things. But, in the sea of stress that is grad school, I just wanted to offer a small tip about something that has helped me, and hopefully a couple of you may benefit from it as well. Good luck with your writing!\n\n[Link to my word log](https://imgur.com/gallery/8a1nlLe)",
