  "text": "So a little background check. I graduated bachelor of science in biology major in cell and molecular biology. I did my undergraduate thesis on methylotroph isolation from one of our local forest hoping to get good candidates for biofertilizer application. When I was an undergrad I was always eager to learn my field. I love all aspects and concepts of biology. I knew someday I wanted to be a professor and educate minds too. \n\nSo when I was in third year, I applied for a scholarship. Since we have a shift in curriculum in the country where we need to add 2 more years of high school (yes we just implemented K-12 very recently) we have shortages of teachers. The scholarship I applied to has a return service agreement where we need to teach high school for 3 years according to our major. I was like you know what I wanted to be a professor anyway so I kinda wanna do this to get some experience and maybe help with my grad school applications when I am done.\n\nBoiiii I was so wrong. They didn't follow the specialization I have when assigning me to school. When schools request for teacher, especially in public school since we have a centralized appointing system for all teachers, they don't bother to check whether it is biology, physics, research etc. They see them all as \"sciences\". In my first year it was grueling since I have to teach all sciences, and biology is just a quarter. Same with my second year. In third year I was reassigned to a new school and they cannot give me pure biology subjects because they need a qualitative research teacher. Never in my whole life I have learned how to do a pure qualitative research paper. The assignment really drained my passion and love to teaching, to the point I don't even wanna smile during my classes.\n\n I feel like trying to learn all new things while teaching them in a day or two really dumbed me down and I am scared that this might be detrimental to my career plans. What if I don't have what it takes anymore to pursue grad school? If I don't pursue grad school, I am stuck with teaching subjects I don't even have passion for. I just wanna share this experience with people and hope maybe someone understands me and give me some advice.",

      "text": "Before I started my PhD program, I was working retail. There is no greater an intellectual purgatory than retail except, perhaps, the department of motor vehicles where I also worked directly before starting grad school. I don't feel like those experiences \"dumbed me down\" at all. \n\nAt least teaching secondary school gives you teaching experience. As a PhD student, you may have to teach intro courses for freshmen and many of these students won't be that far removed from the ones you taught as a secondary education teacher, so you will at least have experience in classroom management, dealing with students, preparing lesson plans, etc. You may not have acquired *research* skills, but those can be taught too. Nobody enters graduate school knowing everything they need to know, so your experience in secondary education gives you a different perspective, but not an inferior one. You've still acquired some skills during your time there, and that would be something to emphasize when you apply to grad programs. What did you learn and how can you take those lessons into your program?\n\nTBH, I think it's fairly easy to translate your experience in secondary education into a net positive in a grad admissions application. Lots of former teachers end up going back for MS or PhD degrees, so it would hardly be unusual.",
