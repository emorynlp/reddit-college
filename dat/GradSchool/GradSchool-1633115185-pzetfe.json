  "text": "It's been a month of grad school so far and I'm no where near as smart or skilled as the rest of my classmates but I've managed to successfully hide it with a little bit of confidence and smart talk. I sometimes feel like an imposter because of this and really wonder why I'm here and how long I can keep up this act.",

It\u2019s especially rough at the moment because I have a biology background and I\u2019m working as a part of a biophysics group which is a collaboration between the two. So, I listen to people with a physics background and have no idea what they are saying sometimes. However, a post doc I work with has said to me she rarely understands the biological theory of our meetings. \n\nA lot of people have a touch of winging it through life. It\u2019s normal. I often feel dumb compared to my colleagues. I receive a good grade on something and think my supervisor is being kind or the pandemic is somehow meaning people are going easier on students (I\u2019m an MSc student). I try to see my peers as inspirational and people to learn from, instead of letting my negative thoughts about myself get me down.",

On the very first test, I felt studied so much I scored 2 points below average. On the second test, I scored 2 points below average again. All I could think about is that I wasn\u2019t as smart as I thought, and I cried. It really was a shocking wake up call. I felt like an imposter and that all these students were smarter than me and I didn\u2019t belong. \n\nThen when I started making friends, I found out that not only were they smart, but they were also hard working. So to me, I realized that if I wanted to pull ahead of people to get into a good specialization, I had to study even more. Ultimately my rank is in a good place which is now above 50%, so I got that going for me. \n\nThe point of the story probably wasn\u2019t sold very well but it is that you got into grad school. Each and every one of you are capable of doing great things. But the thing is, if you want to be more successful, work ethic is a must. Put in extra work to study the material that everyone else seems to know, and study it ad nauseum.",
