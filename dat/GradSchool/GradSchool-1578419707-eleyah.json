  "title:": "I tried one \"new thing\" every month last year to get out of the work-sleep-repeat rut. I was shocked by the improvement in my quality of life and productivity as a grad student. (list of potential hobbies enclosed lol)",
  "text": "For my first three years of grad school, my schedule consisted of working 12-14 hour days, coming home, and vegging on the couch before going to bed. I was unhappy and not as productive as I would've liked, but I didn't have the time or energy to do anything else.\n\nLast year, my new years resolution was to force myself to do things. Starting out sucked all of my energy dry, but I forced myself to try one new \"thing\" per month. \n\nAfter a few months... my entire life was better. I was working less but being more productive, as I had more energy, was sleeping better, and was in general healthier. In the morning, I looked forward to coming to work, and in the evening, I looked forward to coming home and working on a project. \n\nIt was a shitty year for me (lost a few family members, including a parent, and had some academic setbacks), but I'm in a significantly better place than I was last year. \n\nNow, I know this post can come across as a bit r/wowthanksimcured, which is not my intention. It's just a success story of someone who has gotten out of the work-sleep-repeat pattern. \n\nFor those of you who might want to try some new things, my monthly new thing list was as follows:\n\nJanuary - snowboarding (love it, still do it!)\n\nFebruary - painting (didnt enjoy it)\n\nMarch - kickboxing (liked it, but too costly)\n\nApril - Journaling (not my thing)\n\nMay - knitting (loved it, still do it)\n\nJune - gardening (love it) \n\nJuly - piano lessons (dud)\n\nAugust - app development (still do it)\n\nSeptember - gym (still do it)\n\nOctober - rock climbing (nah)\n\nNovember - 3d animation (love it!)\n\nDecember - scrapbooking (fun)",

I look forward to the next hobby I'm going to take up next month. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience!",

I'm currently getting my MA in Japan and coming up towards the end, so I want to travel and make sure I see more of the country before I leave. It has been very easy to fall into a school/work - home - netflix - sleep routine. Especially since a lot of the hobbies I had in the U.S. before coming here I haven't been able to keep up with in the same way. But there are so many things to see even just in the immediate area, so I'm making a list and want to visit at least a few places a month.",

When you are a kid so much is new and exciting or different so it stands out.  As you age, things are more common and you settle into a routine.  They suggested scheduling something to look forward to during the week and not just the occasional weekend.  I have been doing this for awhile and will say it helps mentally.  Some little things I have done are\n\n* trying a new restaurant or bar\n* game night with friends\n* renting a movie I'm excited about\n* running on a new trail (I do endurance running)\n* meeting up with a friend to not talk about school or work-that is the key part!\n* photography\n* swimming\n* trying a new exercise class\n* watching a sunset\n* birding\n\nMany free or low cost options if you think about it and get creative.  I also found it helpful for being more productive during the week.  If I want to go to my photo club on Thursday, I need to be caught up to go so I waste less time.",

And maybe better boundaries and a better work-life balance. \n\nI think I'm starting to get better now but it's been nearly 7 years since I first attempted suicide and started treatment. I tried every medication they could think of until the doctors stopped prescribing them, I tried weekly therapy for years until the doctors gave up, I tried exercising and eating better, I tried sleeping more, I tried cleaning my room and setting small goals, I tried forcing myself to do things, I tried illicit drugs and risk-taking, I tried news things as much as I could handle them, I tried making new friends. I kept trying because I wanted to get better. I recommend you try most of it too because maybe one of those will help you where it failed me (not the drugs though, avoid the illegal drugs). \n\nAnd for a long time, none of it helped. Or worse, it made me so angry. I either felt nothing or I felt irrational hatred and rage. I dated people for years and felt nothing, then broke up with them and still felt nothing. People I loved died and I still felt nothing. I was given awards and finished school and I still felt nothing. Then something minor would happen that threw me into a raging tailspin - but still, rage is better than nothing. \n\nI've moved but I don't think that was a magical bullet or anything. I just feel a bit better now. I don't feel *happy*, but I'm no longer crushed by that insane, directionless grief or the lack of interest in living and breathing. Perhaps it's having better, more authentic relationships, trying hard to be more sociable even if I don't quite feel like it, and fixing my relationship with my parents. Maybe it's the new cocktail of drugs that I take off-label. Or maybe it really did just take time. It's very hard to fix an illness when you don't know its cause.",

For instance, I didn't really love painting freeform, so the next week I watched a Bob Ross episode and tried to recreate it. Just small tweaks.",
