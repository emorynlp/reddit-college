  "text": "I\u2019m in the beginning stages of getting applications together for my Masters of Mental Health Counseling. I\u2019m looking at online options right now mainly because I have three young kids, and that just seems logical.  My top choices are NC State, NC Central, and Wake right now.  (I\u2019d love to hear your opinions on other online options!!)  Liberty is my last ditch fallback.  I spoke on the phone to Liberty after submitting my information and it was painful.  They couldn\u2019t tell me their program acceptance rate, pass fail rate for the licensure exam, graduation rate, how many people are in each cohort, nothing.  I am 100% sure I\u2019d get in, but I don\u2019t even think I want to apply there.  When I asked about acceptance rates the guy told me I had a good chance of getting in and I said \u201cwell I want to know if the program is competitive so that I can be competitive in future job prospects\u201d.  He said \u201coh, no one has ever asked me that before\u201d. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc80",

      "text": "As a current undergraduate online student at Liberty, I would personally not recommend going there, especially not for graduate school since that will be the last school (normally) on someone's resume that people see.\n\nFor me, it wound up being a cost and the particular program they had thing, but I feel like there is a lot of hidden costs and I'm spending a lot more than I thought.. Loan doesn't always cover my tuition since they do terms instead of semesters.. I don't know if that for sure throws it off since this is my first experience with loans but I was just stunned I couldn't have my classes covered by a loan. \n\nEvery school I had been to before gave me the pell grant. When I go into the fafsa, it shows I still have more of that to use but for some reason it isn't being used at Liberty. It could be because I was working a lot in the years that its pulling for Liberty and that's what made me no longer qualify for the grant but I barely made anything... you'd think I would just get less. And what do they do for people who no longer work at the place but the financial aid is determined by a job you no longer have?\n\nAs you can see, another big issue is there is no help with Liberty. Since I'm states away, I can't just make an appointment with financial aid or walk into the office - and the place is run like a call center. If you talked to one person about an issue, you only talked to the one person, even if they transfer you you have to retell everything, even if it's on e-mail where there is an e-mail chain connecting everything - they are too lazy to read through it and you have to re-explain everything.\n\nThe same thing goes for the live chat. I even asked one of them if they can see the history of the chat and they said they could. -.-\n\nTo be honest, I am actually really pleased with the academic part of it, believe it or not. I have quite a bit of experience with other online programs and this is probably one of my favorite, if not my favorite. Maybe it's also because I'm more mature now and I'm able to retain things better than when I was young and fidgety, but I just feel like I'm learning a ton.\n\nBut, if I had to do it again I would go somewhere else - anywhere else that actually has people to help you with things. You don't even have an assigned advisor here, which is nuts, it's the first school I've ever been to that didn't either have an advisor or mentor assigned to you. It helps a lot when you are trying to figure out billing, fafsa, whatever issues. It's been an absolute nightmare for me to get things done, and as a person who is applying to graduate school I would have loved more resources and connection with someone but there is just no one. \n\nSo, I would not go unless its all paid for, or its just a stepping stone to further school and you're going somewhere else. Also I wouldn't go if you can't stand religion in everything. I had been to a catholic university before this, but they didn't have religion in all the classes like they do at Liberty. Something I don't care for, personally.",

Liberty is a similar institution, filling a similar niche, and actually a few hours down the road. The entire purpose of the institution was to create educated evangelicals that could fill credential requiring roles in Southern society without being exposed to normal liberal evils of \"college\".\n\nIf you want to get a job at a place where the unwritten, primary qualification is being a \"Good Chrisrian\"\u2122\ufe0f, go to Liberty, otherwise I'd think you'd be better off elsewhere.",

If he wanted to pretend to be an expert, she treated him like one and asked him a bunch of complex statistical questions about the assumptions he was making, the evidence he was using (asking for specific citations) and asking him questions about how those claims reconciled with established research by McFamousface and Dontyouknowhoiam et al.--authors that experts would clearly be familiar with.
