  "title:": "Question: Does anyone know of a scale that can measure mass vs. time?",
  "text": "Based on my experimental setup, I need to measure the transient mass increase as a function of time. I've seen a few scales here and there that have data acquisition capabilities , which is a bare minimum, but none of the scales I have come across have this capability.  \n\nNote: I have additional parameters that will be tracked against time, so I really need the mass measurements to align with the time domain of these parameters.",

My experiment involves period acoustic pulses so I don\u2019t want to even want to try and imagine what it would take to sync both time scales together. \n\nThere\u2019s probably a Matlab script out already that does this, at least that\u2019s what I hope",

I haven\u2019t touched labview since my undergrad so I\u2019m definitely intimidated by the learning curve",
