  "text": "So, I\u2019m done with the semester as well. My GPA is 3.20, I missed three days total, my thesis is going well, and my RA duties are on point and caught up. \n\nI went to every class, meeting, and group thing baked out of my mind. Marijuana has definitely gotten me through another semester.",
