  "title:": "Struggling to see the point of my research because of the pandemic",
  "text": "I used to be pretty enthusiastic about my research, but after a couple weeks of all this pandemic news, I don't feel excited at all by the papers I'm reading and my own analyses and results. To make things worse, I was supposed to defend in May and there are still so many things that I have to finish before defending. I already reached out to my advisor to ask him if I could defend in the summer, which he agreed to, but now I'm beginning to panic because of my daily unwillingness to even look at my work. I was also working on a fellowship proposal for a postdoc, but I can't even bring myself to work on that as well. If there's going to be an economic depression, I don't even know why I'm trying to secure a research position when I should just find any job that can support me.\n\nI feel like I spent so much time not living and enjoying the world, and I can't imagine myself continuing down this path forever now. I just want to find a job where I can stay close to my family and see their happy faces when all of this is over.\n\nI don't even know what the point of this post is.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for sharing their optimism and commiserating with me. I realized after typing this all out that I've been letting myself fall in a depressive state and just reading coronavirus subreddits all day (not healthy...). Trying to remind myself that my research is relevant to the current and post-corona world, even if I can't see it now, and I also installed a website tracker to limit my reddit time to 15 minutes a day. Barely went on reddit yesterday, just read a few updates on the current situation somewhere else, and I actually felt like reading some papers. Good luck to you all and stay safe.",

      "text": "I dont understand that bit about the post-doc. In case of a recession, isn't it usually somewhat better to be in academia than a regular job? The estimates from entities like JPmorgan put potential unemployment rates from this economic downturn at 8-15%. That's almost the same level as the 2008 crisis, but all those jobs lost in just one spring.\n\nOr do you expect these positions to be defunded more than regular jobs or alternatively for the competition for these positions to go up?",

Most graduate students simply grow obese and wealthy thanks to their stipend slush fund. the paradigm now is to replace your PI or faculty adviser simply by sitting on them at the right moment.  In any case endowments have plummeted so badly that they can be purchased at grocery store next to national enquirer and life savers.  Graduate students will not have to worry about work and pay for much longer.",

Every disposable good that could be used by the hospital or clinical lab has been requisitioned.\n\nNot me though.
