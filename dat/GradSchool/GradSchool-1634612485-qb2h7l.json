  "text": "Hey Guys. Not sure if this is the best place to ask this question. But I'm debating on going to grad school. I m 26 years old and I have a BS in corporate finance. I am a bit of a unicorn because I've been working in supply chain since I was 19/20. I am in a senior supply chain position at a Fortune 500 company and My base salary is 120,000 with a bonus of 16%. I have worked in a few jobs making 6 figures since I graduated at 22. I would like to work at a top tier company like Apple/Google. In my current cohort, not all of the folks have even BS degrees. Even my boss doesn't have an MBA. I feel like 7 years of experience and a BS has gotten me pretty far. I feel like an MBA would help me coming into a new role pretty significantly in terms of starting pay, but I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. I know that younger people than me are getting Masters on 5 year programs so I feel like if I want to work there I may need it to be competitive.",

      "text": "You sure are a unicorn at 26 making $120K plus a bonus. I'm assuming you're planning to work and go to school, right? I would not drop your job for a full time program - it is not worth it for you. Look for part time programs, on week nights or weekends. Do you want to go back for your MBA or another master's degree? What is it that you want to do exactly - that will help you determine if a master's degree is right for you and what you want to go back to school for. Don't go back to school just to go back to school, go with a purpose in mind. Ignore the fact that other people go back to school; their path is different from yours.",
