  "title:": "Update: Supervisor won't use correct pronouns?",
  "text": "Two weeks ago I posted about my supervisor changing my pronouns in a letter I wrote: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nsolaf/supervisor\\_wont\\_use\\_correct\\_pronouns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/nsolaf/supervisor_wont_use_correct_pronouns/)\n\nI appreciate the advice and support I got on that post, especially the folks who went to bat for me against bad faith commentary. Thank you! I wanted to write an update for how things have gone since.\n\nI spoke with my university's graduate support advisor and he was fantastic. He walked me through the various options available to me as a response. While my gut feeling about the correct course of action remained the same, it was great to get a better sense of what options and resources are available to me and other members of the trans community. This led to a different tack, which I'll get to in a moment.\n\nSo, I decided that I was going to email my supervisor and lay things out firmly and clearly, asking him to use the correct pronouns in the future. He and I have had a decent camaraderie since even before I came here, but I knew there was so much on the line if I pushed back and he doubled down. I felt a block about actually writing the email.\n\nThen, I attended an online conference and got a boost of confidence about my thesis (a professor I admire used similar sources to construct a parallel argument to one of my chapters). I sat down and wrote about that to my supervisor and then threw in a few lines about using my pronouns.\n\nA day later he wrote back, apologising for misgendering me and assuring me he won't do it again, and then went into thesis talk around this conference. I'm so relieved! I am so glad I wrote about it, and that my supervisor is understanding and supportive. While I don't think I'll be in a traditional TT academic career, it is great to know that path isn't closed to me by a hostile PhD supervisor.\n\nOtherwise, however, things have taken an interesting turn. When the support advisor gave me the rundown of my university's 'Gender Identity and Gender Support Policy' (which itself comes from a legal act!), I asked how their own Academic Registry (AR) still only supports M or F in its database. He didn't believe me until I showed him the screenshots of my requests to AR to fix my student record. The university's own gender support policy explicitly includes non-binary people! I had previously spoken about the limitations of AR's gender scheme to various groups on campus and everyone goes 'that's unfair!', but now we can say, 'that's illegal!'\n\nI'm not sure what the next step(s) will be. The support advisor says he's meeting with AR to fix this, but I've been trying for years now and don't have confidence in the process. I don't want to kick up a fuss for its own sake, but I'm much older than most students and I'd rather deal with the harassment and nay-saying myself in order to clear the way for teenagers to have a supportive environment at their university. Hopefully things will change.",

      "text": "When I started grad school, my first meeting with my PI included a rundown of the project I would be starting and of the senior grad student I\u2019d be working with. The grad student had recently come out as trans (MtF). The PI referred to the grad student first as \u201cshe\u201d, then as \u201che\u201d for the rest of the meeting. I knew her correct pronoun but felt awkward and kind of played dumb and paused when asking a question. I could see him realize he had been mistakenly using the wrong pronoun before he confidently \u201ccorrected\u201d me. \n\nSometimes people make mistakes which can easily be interpreted as malicious. Sometimes those \u201cmistakes\u201d are malicious. I tend to give some latitude but completely understand those who aren\u2019t afforded that luxury.",

          "text": "Twenty years ago, my husband's friend group had a friend who transitioned to female. I found it very interesting that they found it reasonably easy to make the name swop, but they struggled for a long time with the pronouns. They spent a couple of years correcting themselves immediately after saying \"he\".\n\n\nSeeing how absolutely comfortable, supporting, and accepting this group of men were, I think that it would have been very nasty for someone to go off at them for struggling with the pronouns. Especially when they were so obviously trying.",

Clearly you have some life experiences and are looking to further your education, so I'll try and help. None of this is political, it's just science. \n\nYour concept of \"biologic sex\" requires a deeper understanding as to the mechanisms of sex and gender. There are many alterations at chromosomal and gonadal/hormonal levels that profoundly alter a person's outward appearance. Lookup androgen insensitivity syndrome if you don't believe me. So, if nature has already given us many many examples of people whose gender is at odds with either their chromosomal or gonadal sex then we clearly have to apply a gender schema that doesn't utterly rely on chromosomes or gonads. Having done so, it makes no sense to force people whose chromosomal/gonadal sex don't conform with their psychological experience of their gender to be forced into a gender they do not identify with. My point is the line is ALREADY arbitrary by biological necessity, so why not draw the line to allow people to identify as the gender that seems most psychologically valid?\n\nI understand that this argument may go against some of your beliefs, but as scientists we have to remove our ego from the equation and judge things based on empirical data. If you want to be educated about this issue I recommend reading the work of Dr Marc Breedlove. Some of his work is controversial, and I don't agree with all of his findings, but much of his research is very interesting.",
