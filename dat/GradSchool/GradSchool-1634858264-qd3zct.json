  "text": "Studying in Computer Science master, this is my first semester. My major was not CS in undergrad (math), and I think I am not ready to take 3 graduate CS courses at the same time. I took one CS course + 2 general education in my undergrad, and it was even hard, so how can I handle three at the same time? \n\nI am really exhausted right now. I was in my home country and came to the US after a year and three months, so I thought it was okay at first since I finished my undergrad in the US, but it was not. It seems that I had depression that I didn't know about, and things outside of school didn't work out, so I was under a lot of stress. And I don't have much knowledge of CS, which made me hard to follow. I really hate myself for not thinking about why I didn't work harder and why I would reduce the number of courses by talking with a counselor at the beginning of the semester. In the beginning, I got huge stress from everything and I didn't want to do anything, so I gave up studying, and I should've done that. I just made an appointment for mental health care, but I am not sure it will help me. \n\nThe saddest thing for me is that I have nowhere to go to talk about my hardships. I am the only person around me who started studying abroad, so no one can empathize with my feelings. All they can see is grades, so it will look like I didn't study because I just wanted to play. There was a time when I didn't get my grades in the first quarter of my bachelor's degree, and my parent rebuked me for not studying because they thought I did not study, so I got angry and cried alone for several days.\n\nThank you and sorry if you feel difficult to read my long and confusing words. Anyone who was in a similar situation, any advice will be really appreciated. I want to try my best to finish this nightmare, but I think I am a bit tired and need some time.",

      "text": "Talk to others in your classes and your cohort, they will likely be more understanding than people who have not experienced grad school. Also talking to your professors about the classes would help you keep on top of them as much as you can. Its okay to take it slow and drop a couple of classes if you need to in order to catch up in the beginning",

They are the specialists who deal with your exact issue, and will be happy to help you! You can reach out to the administrators in your specific department/program, and/or the counseling center. \n\nI also 100% endorse talking to your professors about what's going on, especially if you feel overwhelmed.",

      "text": "I'm sorry to hear you're struggling.\n\nI can relate to what to what you're going through, I am also a 1st semester CS student coming from a different undergraduate program (psych + stats for me). Grad level CS is no joke, so don't feel too bad about struggling with 3 classes at once. I was taking 2 and was so stressed that I dropped to 1. I'm still stressing but finding it easier to handle and am taking it day by day.\n\nI think you should reach out to counseling services on your campus. Idk if your school has many international students but I'm certain that you're not the only person on campus feeling this way. Make sure you take care of yourself! If that means dropping some classes and taking your program slowly, that's okay! Your health comes first. I'm rooting for you. We can get through this!",

I contacted with counseling service and international center to get help. I did not take three major courses even I was an undergrad, so I think I am not ready to handle this. Not sure two Ws in the first semester's transcript will look really bad, that's my only concern. \n\nWe don't have as many international students as my undergrad (I think so), so the system is really late. Hope they will reply soon.",
