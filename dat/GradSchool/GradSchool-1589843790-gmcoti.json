I just can\u2019t imagine the rest of my PhD without them. I don\u2019t know what to do. \nI\u2019ve had a couple over the phone appointments with a grief counselor and will continue doing that. It\u2019s just hard bc we can\u2019t go anywhere or see anyone. Sorry, not sure why I\u2019m posting this here. Has anyone else lost someone in your program? How do we go forward?",

She wasn't in my grad school cohort but she was a year ahead of me in undergrad and studied the same subject, we were basically attached at the hip, started a student association together. We were still very close after we went to do our MAs and PhDs in different cities. She died v suddenly due to complications 12 days after giving birth to her only child in Jan 2019. I didn't grieve properly and my work suffered for about an entire calendar year. I didn't talk about it, and I didn't go to therapy consistently. She wouldn't have wanted that, but I struggled to reach out for help. Please, get help, embrace and deal with your grief. Your friend would want you to take care of yourself. It's ok to have days when you cry, when you can't work. One thing that the loss of my friend taught me was to make time for myself. I used to be a workaholic and I think I'm not anymore (or at least less so). Take the time. These things do take time. It was only when I took time to feel and grieve that things started to get better.",

It might be the first time you truly have to face not just others\u2019 mortality, but also your own. \n\nI broke down at half-time of dear Evan Hansen because someone I know committed suicide years ago.

I wasn\u2019t close with him, but I was with a few of his friends. His advisor said it was the hardest death she had ever experienced, including losing her own parents.\n\n Grief is so difficult, and made even more so by the fact that we cannot come together right now. Be really kind to yourself while you\u2019re going through this. Grief is a really weird process. Some days you\u2019re going to feel ok, and that\u2019s ok. Some days you may not be able to do anything other than exist, and that\u2019s also ok. \n\nI recommend reaching out to others who knew this person as well. It might be comforting to know others are feeling and experiencing the same things as you. This includes talking to your faculty advisor - they are going through this as well and may be able to help you.\n\nYour school may have resources to help out to ease the schoolwork / research burden as well. Utilize them to give yourself time to grieve. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. I wish I could wrap you in a big hug and give you a shoulder to cry on.",
