  "text": "I recently had to drop a course due to underperformance and a very low average that I had no chance of bringing up. While I am relieved that I no longer have to deal with it anymore, I am upset because I won\u2019t be graduating when I planned to. \n\nLet me lay it out for you. I\u2019m on the verge of finishing my thesis proposal and my classes, and I was originally planning to be 100% done by the end of spring. But now I\u2019m going to have to take an extra class next semester and I won\u2019t have as much time to work on my thesis, and I could potentially be working on it through summer and possibly into next fall. \n\nI know none of that sounds to bad, but the thing is I had big plans for when I graduate. I was going to go to Spain for a month, possibly get a dog, get a job in another city, and start dating again (I\u2019m taking a year off from dating to focus on finishing my studies). Now I\u2019m going to have to put all of that off even longer. It\u2019s like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and learning that the tunnel is longer than I originally thought. \n\nI know that there are people here who have had to deal with that. How do you manage?",

      "text": "I recently had to do this too.  I will have to retake the two courses this time next year, postponing what would have been my first semester of thesis focus (with a second semester to follow).  So I will basically put myself 6 months behind.  The time feels a bit more evasive to me because it\u2019s so far out.  And I have a house and a cat and a partner.  There isn\u2019t much I was putting off, other than being an actual grown up with an actual job (I\u2019ve worked piecemeal gigs to cover for years, even before graduate school.  I haven\u2019t had a normal, full time job with benefits and a steady paycheck since\u2026. 7 years ago?  I honestly couldn\u2019t tell exactly anymore).  \n\nPoint is,  I fell APART last weekend over it.  Total meltdown.  (Almost lost said partner).  I was instantly relieved when I withdrew but it ate at me for days.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t part of the original plan and I\u2019m trying to take it easy on myself and tell my inner critic to just shove it.  \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you had to do that.  If you ask me, you absolutely made the right decision.  And I don\u2019t know if you are even contemplating that.  But is okay and normal to grieve the plans you made.  You are working toward so many incredible goals and it sucks to wait for the pay off.  I\u2019m sorry you have to wait.  In the mean time, we\u2019re here to keep you company.   And please feel free to PM me when you make it, because you totally will make it  :)",
