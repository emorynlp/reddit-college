  "text": "I'm thinking I may have picked the wrong program here...\n\nI just started my PSM program this semester (haven't even been to my first class yet) and it's already not what I imagined. There are no labs, the program director described it as \"not a research master's,\" and I'm rapidly discovering that PSMs are geared towards people trying to get into industry, not research. I had wanted to use the degree to become a conservation biologist.\n\nThere is a capstone research project, which is good, but I can't help but wonder if I should cut my losses and bail for a different program. I was accepted into an MS program as well, but I already told them I wouldn't be attending... did I really, really, mess this up?\n\nPanicking a little bit. Help!",

I keep thinking I should have just accepted the other program.\n\nIt was between the PSM and the MS, and I picked the PSM ultimately because the university was saying they'd be operating on campus instead of remotely (because of COVID). But now two out of three of my classes are still online.\n\nDo you think there's a chance I can or should try to get into the MS program again?\n\nThere are people who go into research after getting a PSM and a PhD but I'm not sure that's wise, when I was told to get my master's and milk it as much as possible and only if I'm not satisfied with what it brings me should I get a PhD.",

                      "text": "MS degrees are money makers for the college because you pay for everything. A PhD is usually subsidized by the adviser who has govt grant money, if you do your research. Also you get a MS on the way to a PhD and it is usually along the subsidized route. A prof will support a student that is gonna research for him for 5 years where a MS is only gonna be there for two years. Not enough time to do research IMO. I don't understand just getting a MS personally unless you just want to do lab work forever. Get a PhD after but you will be there another 4 or 5 years. I got my MS and PhD in 5 years. See if you can use the psm as a stepping stone in the PhD program at this college?\n\nSee if the other school is still open? Wouldn't hurt to ask.",

I got freaked out when I realized a PSM was going to take me completely in the wrong direction.\n\nBut you've given me the courage to formulate a plan for changing my major. I know it isn't as easy to do that as it is in undergrad, but all my credits for this semester should transfer, assuming I'm accepted. And I was accepted to all the schools to which I applied properly except for an ivy league, so I'm feeling cautiously optimistic about that.\n\nAnxiety attack over. Thank you for your help.",
