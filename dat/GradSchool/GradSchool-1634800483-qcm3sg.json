  "text": "I am planing to get my PhD from the US and i have been told the fellowship money or the stipend I get is enough to live there comfortably ( I am not spendthrift and spend wisely). But I will have to support my parents back home in India so can I work part time jobs along side so that i can send some money back home in India?",

But at the end of the day it's completely up to you regardless of what the program says. I know people who's PhD program doesn't allow outside work, but they still secretly have side jobs such as tutoring or being a barista.",

So anything you did do would have to be under the table.\n\nedit: working under the table and getting caught might jeopardize your visa, so that's something to think about. However, I'm sure you're not the only international student to have this dilemma. At whatever university you end up at I would try and discretely ask other international grad students what they do if they need extra money.",

More if I cut back in some places and I live in HCOL city, so having some extra money may be doable if you find a good program. If you do get a job try to get one that pays under the table (tutoring would be a good one) and that you can also say is contributing to your career development. I had a friend that charged $30-50 per hour for tutoring and had several sessions a week.",

The best way to make more money is to a) go to to one of the top 10-20 schools in your field (for example MIT/Harvard pay about 20% more than BU/Northeastern despite being located in the same city) and b) doing CPT internships (depends on area of study and advisors, but you can basically double your annual salary by working at a big tech/finance firm for the summer). However, doing either of those things is definitely not easy or straightforward.",
