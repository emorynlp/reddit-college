  "title:": "Failing to Meet MS Thesis Deadlines",
  "text": "I am actually panicking at the moment as I've begun to realize that there is no way I finish my thesis and defend on schedule. I spent months unable to make significant progress on my thesis, and I stalled even more due to unexpected life events popping up one after another. \n\nThis past (and last) semester of my 2 years here was spent off payroll, as I had completed my credit hours and didn't schedule any courses. I figured I'd be able to spend this time finishing my thesis and finally visiting family (thanks Covid) before I began my professional career. Unfortunately, with my awful progress on the thesis, I never took the time to make any familial visits. Additionally, the company I'd hoped to eventually work with years down the line unexpectedly had several positions open up, and I sprung on the opportunity before it passed me up.\n\nNow that I'm working, time has become an illusion, and I miscalculated submission and defense deadlines by a large margin, leaving me with an incomplete thesis, missing paperwork, and an advisor blissfully unaware of the situation as I approach the first deadline 4 days from now.\n\nI have a meeting with my advisor in 2 days, and I'm terrified of how it will go, as he has no idea how far behind this all is. My job has been pulling overtime every day this week due to the many positions they are working to fill, leaving me with only a couple of hours each day to work on my thesis. I'm not sure what will happen if I fail to meet these deadlines, and the company I now work for is expecting me to complete my degree next month, as it is integral to the career path I plan to take beyond my current position. Somehow the worst part of all this is that I wasn't able to visit home, and my current position won't allow vacation time for quite a while; I feel like I have really failed my family in that regard.",

      "text": "My friend, you have two difficult conversations on the horizon.  My suggestion is to take the bull by the horns and proactively engage your mentor and boss in a solutions/future oriented conversation about building a pathway to success given your current circumstances.   To get there may require the perfunctory mes culpa\u2019s.  Listen to what they have to say without being defensive.  Let me reiterate that you cannot be defensive.  Not that you sound defensive but almost everyone has that impulse in these types of situations.  The best thing you can do in these situations is listen to be heard.  Before you talk to them, decide what you are willing to do to make this happen.  There will undoubtedly be sacrifices.  Think through what your willing to do and communicate that.  Bring your own plan for moving forward.  No boss or supervisor likes to hear about problems without solutions.  Why should they work harder than you to get you out of the hole you\u2019ve dug for yourself? I\u2019m not faulting you or berating you I\u2019m just telling you the reaction that most mentors/bosses will have.  If you develop a plan that also says you\u2019re willing to put some elbow grease into it.  More than likely, your boss and mentor ultimately want to see you succeed.  But they can\u2019t help you deal with a situation they don\u2019t know about.  Be proactive despite the challenges. Be humble and responsive to their thoughts/opinions. And offer a path forward that reflects your commitment to your own success.  \n\nI hope that\u2019s helpful and I wish you the best in dealing with a difficult situation.",
