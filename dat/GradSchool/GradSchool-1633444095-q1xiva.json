  "title:": "My department refuses to go by their own handbook",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been having a major issue lately of my department refusing to go by their own handbook. In plain writing it says we can take 3 hours our last semester as reading hours to prepare for our exams, but my department is refusing to allow me to take them saying the handbook is wrong. I\u2019m also trying to get my exams set up, and the handbook says we have to have taken 1 class or be enrolled in the class, but my department is saying we have to have taken 2 classes on the subject (which means I would have to take an exam on something I\u2019m worse at). I had this problem last semester as well; I wanted to add a graduate minor and they told me that they don\u2019t allow it even though it was in the handbook. Do you guys have any advice on what to do in this situation??",
