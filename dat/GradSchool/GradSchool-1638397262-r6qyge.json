  "text": "I\u2019m a college freshman looking into graduate school options (either Masters in Public Policy or a Masters in Education Policy), but I can\u2019t find any comprehensive grad school advice posts. \n\nI\u2019m looking for something akin to the r/ApplyingtoCollege wiki, but I haven\u2019t been able to find anything similar here, at r/gradadmissions, or elsewhere online. \n\nI understand that grad school is much more variable based on the field of study than undergraduate admissions, but I want to get my footing around research, internships, academic performance, etc, especially since I currently have a lot of free time.\n\nIf anyone could point me to websites, articles, or comprehensive reddit posts/subreddits, it would be much appreciated.",
