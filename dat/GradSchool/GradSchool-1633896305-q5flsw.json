  "text": "Hello, everyone! New here.\n\nI was wondering if you all could guide me a little about how to write a Letter of Motivation for grad school applications. I tried looking up samples bit they were all really generic i.e \"I am interested in your program. I graduated from so and so\". Are LOMs for grad schools different from those for undergraduate programs? Id really appreciate your help. Thank you, in advance.",
