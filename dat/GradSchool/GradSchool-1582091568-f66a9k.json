  "text": "My advisor has been encouraging me to take the academic career path since pretty early on. I\u2019ve been set up for success. I have publications, I\u2019ve gotten grants and fellowships. I am on the short list for a great post doc position on a project with major implications for my field. The PI for the project pumps out papers like a beast. The post doc position has potential for advancement to faculty. \n\nAnd I have yet to go 4 days in a row without a an anxiety attack since returning from the on-site interview. I\u2019ve always dealt with anxiety, but not like this. \n\nI realized that I absolutely do not want to do this, and I should have known this a long time ago. \n\nI thought academia is what I was supposed to do. To do anything else would be wasting my intelligence and giving up (I am fully aware that this is nonsense). I\u2019ve always been a high achiever- this is just how it\u2019s supposed to be. The fact that almost every meeting with my advisor for the last year has resulted in a meltdown has nothing to do with the sinking feeling in my gut that I\u2019ll be miserable in academia.\n\nExcept it totally does. I\u2019ve finally started to listen to myself (yay, therapy!). That feeling in my gut was there for a reason. It\u2019s ok to not want to be under the constant pressure to publish, or the constant need to bring in grants. I\u2019d like life to be less of a struggle and a little easier for once, please and thank you. It\u2019s not giving up- it\u2019s deciding what I want to put up with for the rest of my career, and what\u2019s important in life. I don\u2019t have to make myself miserable to prove whatever the fuck I was trying to prove. I\u2019m not giving up. I\u2019m allowed to be happy. \n\nNow I just have to call the PI of the postdoc position I interviewed for and have an awkward conversation...",

Took a couple of years off. Explored a lot of career options. Went to law school much older than most of my classmates. Loved it. I'm not a practicing lawyer but it was the best three years of my life. \n\nAcademia isn't what it used to be. Lack of funding, competition, and the adjunct/VAP situation has made it a totally different game than even 20 years ago. \n\nThought telling my advisor was going to be a real rough one. He said he already knew....\n\nFeel free to drop me a line if you want to commiserate/bitch!",

      "text": "I think its great that you caught yourself, academic PIs (in my experience) always push their students in the direction of academia because it is both what they know and also they want to spawn little PI-lets.    \n\n\nThat said if you want to stick in the sciences in general and you are thinking of industry over academia (rather than a completely different path altogether)....then having postdoc experience in a different group, continuing to grow connections but with an eye towards industry may still be beneficial.  \n\n\nNot saying do it if it is going to give you a panic-attack breakdown but perhaps if you view the work more as a means to an end, a way of making connections with industry that will line you up for a job outside of academia, it might have a very different feel to it.  \n\n\nOf course if you already have connections to industry or plan on pursuing something completely different then by all means, get out now.",

      "text": "Thank you for this post! This is something I've struggled with over the past four years with a lot of my anxiety and everything else coming to a reckoning point last year when I went to the annual national conference in my field and was questioned by former mentors and colleagues about what was next as I was approaching my final year of my PhD. After making the decision to leave academia, I felt better but I avoided sharing this information with my current PI because I still wasn't 100% sure that I would be happy outside academia (it's difficult to get hired with a PhD in my field outside of academia). Given the potential difficulty of finding employment outside of academia with a PhD (I'm willing to branch into other fields/types of jobs), I thought about every instance of my gut feelings of my body progressing to the point of physical sickness over the thought of all the pressure I was under and would continue to face post-PhD if I remained in academia, I seriously considered quitting. However, I also considered how I would feel about myself to have gotten as close as I have to completing the PhD only to quit with close to 2/3 of a dissertation completed (stupidly doing the 3-publication format, so that just makes it 10x more difficult/slow at this point). I knew I'd hate myself if I did quit having come so close, so I'm finishing the PhD with the knowledge and better outlook that I don't have to face this same kind of pressure and anxiety when it's all finally over. I also told my PI early last summer (about a month after the conference) after I was certain that I did not want to continue in academia. I can seek a job that allows me to leave work at the office and not have to face anxiety over the late-night must-reply-now emails from PIs demanding drafts and updates, an endless stack of papers to grade without picking up some undergrad illness from them, or the overwhelming pressure to hurry up and get those grant applications done or the long to-do list of other things to get done for various publications. I hate leaving loose ends, so I will seek to publish any remaining odds and ends following my PhD, but it will be on my terms and on my own schedule. \n\nGood luck to you in your post-ac journey!",

I just started this past year, but those with a Master\u2019s and more experience often charge around $60.  Tutors with PhD\u2019s in these subjects (especially Org) average about $120/hour.  I like it because it\u2019s flexible, I\u2019m my own boss, it pays well, and I get to help people.  It also helps keep my mind fresh on topics I otherwise might forget.

Even if it wasn't I would just drop out cuz no way I'm walking from this job XD .. I work as a Data Engineer.  I think you're on the right track. definitely start looking for jobs now. Even just contracting and sub-contracting is a good start. Also with a PhD you can be more client facing or go the independent contracting route. My program candidates regularly do their research overseas in regions afflicted with conflict. Because a lot of the field work and research involves conflict and mediation practices.. We are a program with a PhD student mortality rate and also PhD candidates that do field research are required to do therapy and counseling after they return. I honestly, chose a topic that's quantitative and requires no travel. So I can hold down my job, and also no plans to do field research. A lot are less likely to do quantitative research and are comfortable with qualitative methodologies and so they do field research. they're required to have fluency in a foreign language prior to becoming a candidate. there are also people doing domestic research in the US. I'm in a Peace & Conflict Studies program.",

I've struggled for the entirety of grad school but especially the last two years and just (fully) made the decision to quit about two weeks ago and told my advisor last week. It was one of the toughest things I've ever had to do but every day I've felt more and more confident in my decision. I still don't know exactly where I'll end up but I'm trying to give myself time to figure that out (it helps that I can continue doing my fellowship which will financially support me until August).\n\nI think PhD programs end up attracting a lot of people-pleasers. You were identified as intelligent when you were young, family/teachers/professors encouraged to pursue academics, and somewhere along the way you started listening to what everyone else wants you to do with your life as opposed to what you want to do. Here's the kicker though, *no one cares*. Yes, you'll disappoint some people and have to have some uncomfortable/emotional conversations. But once it's out there, people accept it and move on amazingly quickly.",

I know that deciding \u201cnot academia\u201d won\u2019t suddenly make my world bright and shiny, but I\u2019m finally letting myself acknowledge that academia doesn\u2019t feel right for me, and that I\u2019m allowed to feel that way.
