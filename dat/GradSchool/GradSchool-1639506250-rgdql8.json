The culmination of term papers, discussion papers, proposals, and my thesis puts me at about 330 pages over the course of 3 years. I'm not sure how that compares to other disciplines. Prior to grad school, I would have said my least favorite thing was writing but now that I've completed my thesis I look forward to writing a few articles and attempting to publish them.",
