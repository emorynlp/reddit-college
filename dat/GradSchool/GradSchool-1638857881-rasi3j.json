  "title:": "How bad is it to just do the bare minimum to graduate?",
  "text": "I have no interest in staying in academia. None. Nada. I want to work in industry or government. \n\nI'm currently writing up my thesis. Up until now, I've been a good student: I've done my presubmission talk for my PhD and achieved a perfect score. I have a 4.0 in coursework. I've won major competitions in the field I want to work in after graduation. \n\nHowever, I am really struggling with motivation to finish my degree. I will do it, but I'm not feeling it. I haven't enjoyed my PhD much, and the past half year has been a lot for me - I had a somewhat traumatic birth and also ended up with postpartum anxiety problematic enough that I spent two months in hospital (in a mental health ward). My panic attacks were so severe that some symptoms overlapped with seizure symptoms, such as paralysis, muscles contorting and loss of vision. I'm doing so much better, but my focus is on getting as well as I can rather than thinking about how to make my PhD great. Because of all of the supports, I'm also busy going to my psychiatrist, psychologist, child psychologist, anxiety group as well as a parenting confidence program as my anxiety left me second guessing everything I was doing. \n\nAt this point, I just want to move on, graduate and get a part-time job in my desired field (they exist) so I can spend some time at home with my beautiful baby and also do some interesting work (I have not found my PhD interesting in a long time). Once I return from maternity leave, I only have a few months left (which I can stretch out if I go back part-time), so if I were to produce a great thesis, it would need a huge amount of focus over that period. \n\nHow bad would it be to submit a thesis that is pretty mediocre but enough to pass? Will there be professional consequences down the line if I'm not in academia?",

Just having one would be impressive enough... I doubt many of your future employers would even be competent to judge whether it's \"good\" or \"average\" or \"below average\".\nI have worked outside academia for most of my career (I don't have a phd, mind), and while a lot of jobs require a degree, I have never had to show my grades for any of them. It's having a degree at all plus relevant experience that's the main thing. \n\nGood luck with everything.",

Outside of academia, you will probably never meet another person who has read or is interested in reading your thesis. They will see that you have a PhD and be like \"huh, he/she must be really smart\" and that's about that. Having your degree may open more doors to you that were closed before, but the exact subject of your thesis pretty much matters if you're going on the academic job market.",

First because you don\u2019t want to undershoot and end up failing (rare but could happen) but secondly because one of the reasons you work so hard to get your thesis as good as it can be is to minimise corrections later. The \u2018worse\u2019 your thesis is when you submit, the more likely it is you\u2019re going to get a long list of majors to sort out later, so you\u2019re really just risking prolonging that work. At this point that may be a risk you\u2019re happy to take, it\u2019s a judgement call for you. I definitely got to a point where I said to my supervisors I\u2019m done with this now and I\u2019m not adding anything new/making it \u2018better\u2019, I\u2019m just polishing what\u2019s already here - but even doing that takes a lot of work.
