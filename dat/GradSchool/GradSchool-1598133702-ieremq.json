I think the positive about programs like med school and law school is that even though grind culture exists, the program is classes (large and small groups) so you can create a community of support with your fellow slaves. In STEM, (I\u2019m in Bio) after your first year, you are essentially cut off from the community. Especially in the pandemic if there are limitations on how many can be in the lab. That makes it even more so important for maintaining hobbies and relationships.",

Now I am working on my grad degree in SPED diag and the entire program consistes of five week courses. My readings for this week alone was about 200 pages of scientific journals and about 12 videos. For every course, every week, we have a quiz, a paper in APA 7 format, a discussion submission with 2 replies, a Webinar journal, and all the materials that need to be studied. I have very little time to take care of my family. I am up late everynight and get very little sleep. I have not even had time to write my lesson plans next week and today is Sunday.

I'd suggest that now (and regularly throughout your degree) you step back to take a hard, clinical look at how you use your time and evaluate what environment or tools make you more productive. Be proactive about experimenting with how to increase your efficiency and discipline. \n\nTaking regular breaks, limiting your hours to something sustainable, and having healthy, diverse hobbies/friendships are *absolutely* a part of that.  \n\nOn the other side, though, it's also important to be disciplined about your use of time and to identify and acknowledge the things that you're wasting time on.  When you need a break, then by all means take a break!  But do something that actually refreshes you.  Design your breaks to make you feel genuinely rested and able to get back to whatever you need to do, not just to procrastinate or wallow.  You're better off spending 6 hours working at high efficiency than 10 hours working at half efficiency.  Not only will you get more done, but your mental health will be much better.\n\nLastly, every time you start a new task, first estimate how long you'll need for that task.  When you finish the task, go back and check how bad your estimate was.  Once you get better at estimating how long things take you, you'll get better at planning out your time and feel more in control of your schedule.",
