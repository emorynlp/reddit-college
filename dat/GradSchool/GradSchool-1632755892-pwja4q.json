      "text": "First, sorry you are dealing with his very realistic and understandable struggle. I relate to this challenge a lot and There are some great answers here. I might add that if you feel an adrenaline rush when it comes to deadlines , you might consider tricking yourself that the deadlines are earlier to get it done. But mostly , be nice to yourself , you can only do as good as you can at this time. And take note of your waves and what you may be able to readjust that's incredibly small that might start to shift how you are able to generate energy. Like practicing going to bed at a consistent Time (this connects to filling )your day with consistency and structure ). And again, take it bit by bit and if you just not able too, you are just not able too, and try not to have self judgment about it. Also you may be a deep hole some times of freon overwhelmed by what you have to do, tht you don't takebasic care of yourself. Consider a meditative walk, a shower, and journaling to connect more in your body. This can seem like it's no a good use of time when things are due , however, it may be exactly what you need to get some energy back. I know it's not easy and remember, you are doing best you can and that's ogood enough.",

Keep it small and helpful like \"Delete spam mail\" \"go for a 10 minute walk\" \"fill your water bottle\". I have one pinned to my desk to help foster a sense of productivity.\n2. On days where you have more energy, use some to make your down days easier. Meal prepping, to-do list making, laundry, etc. Just don't exhaust yourself and make sure to chill on those days, too. These are gifts for your future self.\n3. Gratitude lists. At the end of every day I make a mental list of 5 things I am grateful for. They can be anything from \"having a warm bed\" to \"making someone smile\".\n4. Break tasks into the smallest possible steps and work from there. This has been noted before but this is the most key, I think. **Small steps** and **just starting** with even a fraction of a percent of progress makes such a difference.\n5. Motivation list. I have this taped to my planner so I see it frequently. Remind yourself why you care about what you're doing.",

For me, the simple things that have made me function at least to the point where I can get by are: \n- letting go of my perfectionism (this is a crippling point of anxiety for me- I put off everything because even writing a sentence that I don\u2019t like makes me very distressed. You can imagine how slow for progress that is, only worsening my depression. I basically have forced myself to churn out crap, which somehow does make me feel okay in the end because at least something is done, and then I just refine from there. \n- avoiding caffeine/other stimulants \n- working alongside a buddy! When I\u2019m at home and trying to get things done, I just ruminate over things and I end up achieving nothing and feeling very isolated. I\u2019ve found my favourite spot in my university library, and my friend and I meet there often and study the whole day together/bring each other snacks (this of course depends on your personality but for me alleviating the feelings of loneliness has helped a lot!)  \nGoodluck- I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re not feeling the best.

I know this is the essence of therapy but around me I see friends doing PhDs, on meds, but still struggling a lot because they do not change their habits causing negative feedback loops. Good luck!

You can skip or skim readings for now in favor of just getting things turned in and keeping up with your self-care. When you have a good day (because you do and you will!), take full advantage of it so you can afford a low-effort day or a day off when you need one.  Don't set unrealistic goals for the day or week - you'll only be bummed with yourself if you find yourself unable to meet them. However, do hold yourself to the important stuff (sleep hygiene, feeding yourself, taking your meds, not bailing on therapy, getting outside, social time, etc.). I know how hard those things can feel when you're depressed, but if you're not accountable with taking care of yourself, your school responsibilities will be impossible to manage. Strategically scheduling these types of things into your day can be super helpful. My heart goes out to you, I hope things look up soon.",

      "text": "Here's something that helped me to be kinder to myself and also monitor my own mental state when I was extremely depressed in grad school (you're about to see just how bad it was for me). Rather than just having a to-do list for each day, which would often make me feel worse whenever I failed to accomplish everything on my list, I had A, B, and C goals for each day, in descending order of priorities. As long as I accomplished at least A goals, I'd count that day as a win. \n\n \"A\" goals are the bare necessities to take care of your body to maintain a very basic level of health. For me this was:\n- take meds \n- eat something\n- shower \n\n\"B\" goals are the bare necessities to keep up with work. For me this was:\n- get to work \"on time\" (my work was very flexible so this was mostly a self-inflicted goal)\n- check email + respond to anything urgent \n- attend required meetings \n\n\"C\" goals are things that will actively improve your mental health and move you forward/toward your goals, etc. The work/grad school related tasks on this list will probably change the most depending on your current tasks - some of these are the things I would previously have put on a to-do list:\n- do science: plan an experiment, analyze data, do an experiment, whatever. \n- work on dissertation writing \n- read a paper \n\nThe mental health-related C goals were pretty constant for me, and included:\n- exercise, any form\n- do something creative (could include cooking or baking something new, playing music)\n- spend time outside \n\n\nSo once you have this list, then the idea is to use it to prioritize, and try to adjust your mindset so that you give yourself credit for everything you're doing, recognizing that when you're depressed, just doing the \"bare necessities\" is an accomplishment. \n\nAt the same time, it can be useful to have an objective measure of how you're doing, mentally, to look for patterns in your mental health. For example, you might notice that for a few weeks, you were able to accomplish all your A goals every day, B goals 4 days per week, and C goals 3 days per week... and then the next week, you have a couple days where you can't even manage A goals, and don't have any days where you finish your C goals. That would be a warning sign that your depression is getting worse, and it's worth talking to your therapist about it and trying to identify changes that might be responsible. \n\nI hope this helps! Be kind to yourself. Grad school is hard, depression is harder, and we are living in incredibly stressful times. It's completely understandable that you're struggling, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Y\nAnd your worth as a person is not determined by your productivity.",

      "text": "Something that has helped me has been to break tasks into smaller tasks and make many to do lists-- use action verbs on to do list and include easier things too, ie \"Download \\[class\\] readings, skim readings and annotate, pick up dinner, email \\[person\\], type out equations for \\[homework\\], take medication, shower.\" If you don't accomplish something, you can put it on tomorrow's to do list. If you have a close deadline and essential ADLs like taking meds, always prioritize them obviously. It gets easier the more you do this stuff, and instead of thinking only about your motivation/fear, you focus more on getting things done and approaching them in a doable way. Breaking the tasks up makes them seem less daunting and helps increase self-efficacy so you won't build them up as much in your head. I'm a serial procrastinator and this method has helped me lot.\n\nMirroring what other people have said, but just getting something/anything in is always preferable. It won't kill your grades to fuck up a couple assignments, and a 70 or failing is way better than a 0. The people around you don't want you to push yourself so hard that you fall apart, and just putting in effort to submit something shows you care. Every time you get a good grade, even if it isn't perfect, let yourself be happy about it. You can tell your parents, therapist, or friends of yours not in the program, and it'll boost your self-efficacy to get positive feedback about your performance and make the work seem less challenging to your subconscious. It's always good to think about the broader impact of the work you're doing/will do for motivation too. You're in your program for a reason, and talking to my peers and professors about their work always makes me much more excited about what I'm doing.\n\nAnd yeah, doing things for yourself like self care or even just things you really like as a break or incentive makes a huge difference. I try to set aside at least a little time for hobbies as a reward for finishing particularly daunting tasks. I've also been listening to comedy podcasts while doing low impact cardio workouts (there are even some seated ones on youtube), which is a great motivation to exercise and has a positive impact on my mood disorder. For easier/menial school tasks, I always put on my music. I also always have easy to prepare fruit/veggies on hand, because getting nutrients in and hitting most of your ADLs makes a huge difference for your ability get work done.\n\nAlso, definitely talk about this with your therapist if you aren't already. They'll help you figure out how to manage your feelings about this and alleviate some stress/guilt. Burnout is not unusual too, so they might have tips for you to manage your mental health and school work that are more tailored to your situation.",

      "text": "Some things that have helped me:\n\n1. Cutting down screen time- scrolling on the internet will not do you any good at all. 10 minutes spent scrolling on instagram is 10 minutes you could have spent meditating, or relaxing, or doing your work. Also, you just spent ten minutes exposing yourself to feelings of comparison too. This will not bring you joy. \n\n2. Healthy eating - eating a more colorful diet of fruits, veggies, grains, and meats like fish and chicken give me a really good boost to my mood. Actively preparing the food is very rewarding too. \n\n3. Exercise - I try to bike ride everyday when I wake up. On days I get my bike ride in, I'm way more productive and I'm also generally in a better mood too.\n\n4. Know when to take breaks - for me, I take my breaks in the evenings on Friday and Saturday. I have blocked out those evenings for movies and going out with friends. Talking to people about things that are not school does the soul some good. \n\n5. Start out your mornings with things that bring you joy - every morning I make myself a cup of coffee, have some parle g biscuits, and just sit down and watch an episode of an animated show. It sets the tone for the rest of my day. \n\n6. Read a book outside of school - this can be anything. A biography, memoir, a book about a subject you want to know more about or are passionate about. Sometimes grad work can become so mundane so remind yourself there is a lot to learn outside of school too.\n\n7. Remember what you want in life - this is a powerful motivator for me. I know exactly the kind of life I want to craft for myself and every day in school I get one day closer to it. \n\nI hope this helps you the way this has helped me. Just remember to take things slowly. It is so cliche but it really is a one day at a time kind of thing.",

      "text": "Here are a few things that have worked for me:\n\n**Something is always better than nothing**. If you\u2019re having a really hard time working on something, lower the bar. But DO NOT lower it to zero. For example, maybe I tell myself \u201cI\u2019m going to write my results section on Tuesday\u201d, then I wake up Tuesday morning and I\u2019m totally spent. I turn \u201cwrite results section\u201d into \u201cmake one graph\u201d or \u201cfix the figure captions\u201d. This means I\u2019m still making forward progress, but I\u2019m not getting down on myself for \u201cfailing\u201d. Also, some days I start working and get into the groove, even if I\u2019m not feeling great. \n\n**Consistency** - I work to keep a very consistent schedule. I generally work 10-6 M-F. During work hours, I try to keep my distractions low and work most of that time. This helps me on days I don\u2019t want to work, because I can\u2019t just lay in bed. I have to at least \u201cgo to\u201d work (ie turn on my computer). It also helps me be able to have \u201coff\u201d hours when I don\u2019t feel guilty for not working. The key I\u2019ve found is on days I genuinely cannot find the energy or brain power to work those hours, I give myself the break. I think of it as taking a mental health day from work (which it is), which helps me feel fat less guilty. \n\n**5 seconds of motivation** - this is something my gym buddy and I used to tell ourselves. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to motivate yourself to do a thing because you\u2019re thinking about the whole task. Eg \u201cI have to write a paper\u201d sounds daunting. That kind of thinking keeps me from getting started on whatever it is. But all you have to do is start. You just need to find 5 seconds of motivation to go from \u201cnot doing\u201d to \u201cdoing\u201d. So instead of \u201cI have to write a paper\u201d, think \u201cI just need to get up and walk to my desk\u201d. From there, you can motivate yourself to turn on your computer, then maybe open the document. Each step can be easy, and only needs you to be motivated for a very short period of time. \n\nEdit: accidentally posted before I was done writing\n\nEdit2: I remembered two more\n\n**Resources** - it\u2019s awesome that you have sought help for yourself in the form of therapy in meds. I also recommend you expand the resources you are using. Talk to your on campus disability resources center to see if they have mental health accommodations. Talk to your advisor about how/ why you\u2019re struggling and see if there\u2019s anything they can do to help. Talk to your graduate program if your advisor is totally unwilling to listen / help. You are not the first grad student to be in this position, so the university/ your advisor should know what to do / how to help and have resources in place.\n\n**Meds** - if you have been on your meds for awhile (ie not in the initial period) and you\u2019re still struggling, it might be time to talk to your doctor about changing your dosage or the medication. Finding the right med and dosage will definitely go a very long way to help you out",

I know that personally, it is easy for me to fall into a helpless victim mindset, so it is crucial for me to acknowledge my own agency and control over my life in order to push through mental health episodes and live a healthy life. I also think that saying we are solely responsible for our lives and happiness is unhelpful, of course. What I'm suggesting is that we should be careful with presenting any kind of polarizing rhetoric on mental illness to someone who is clearly already struggling. Even if it's completely valid to us or greater discussions on the subject, you never know who's on the other end of it and if it could be very harmful to them personally. Hope this makes sense, I do not mean to invalidate anyone.",
