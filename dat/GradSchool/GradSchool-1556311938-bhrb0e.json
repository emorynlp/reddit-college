  "text": "To reduce some inherently depressing atmosphere in this sub, I want to share some good news; I am in my 1st semester as a masters student, and one of my committee member who's a big name in dairy industry and sensory science just approved $5000 mini grant for my research! I am proud that I accomplished something that I can put in my resume :-)\n\nEdit: Holy shit this is a lot of likes Thanks yall",

I work in a lab that does bionanotechnology, so nanocarriers and drug-delivery systems and biosensors and all that. My work specifically deals with the analytical chemistry needed to hone sensing systems to specific compounds, i.e. volatile carcinogens or biomarkers. \n\nI'm pretty far removed from isolating DNA and doing PCRs or synthesizing proteins like a traditional biochemist.\n\nBut you can message me if you want to know more.",
