  "title:": "1 month into Grad School at my safety and i feel like shit",
  "text": "I had a rough cycle applying for MPP programs and was wait listed and offered zero aid at my two top choice ivy schools. I ended up going to my safety which is strong for the region I'm in but had little name recognition (it's ranked in the 50-80 area of USNW). I'm a month into the program and (as stupid as this sounds) i cant get over that I'll never get the validation, opportunities, and most importantly extra edge and career latitude that come with attending ivy league grad school. I'm now thinking of doing a stealth application for spring admission to better program. Is this a dumb idea? Am i spazzing out?",

Even if you did get into an Ivy, I can personally attest that it will not make life suddenly better. Heck, it could even end up closing doors you thought it would open. \n\nYou never know what the future might hold, so go for it if you really feel like doing so. But also do all you can to make the most of what you currently have.",

A degree with more wow factor might have given me just a bit more of an edge on some of those factors but despite years of effort I failed to get it. Maybe it's a fool's errand to constantly struggle for the best possible grip on the steering wheel",

Likely you would not have had career opportunities thrown at you for the cost of attendance. The kind of people who see a \"wow\" factor in a degree location alone are not the ones you want to be working for anyway (nor are they likely to be the people actually hiring you).\n\nThe program you're attending is likely going to be much more beneficial in the long run.",

I don't hear employers be as impressed by the school, they're more impressed by the degree + the work that I did during the degree.   \n\n\nbest of luck though, don't fret! everything will be alright :)",

Ultimately, it\u2019s what you make of your experience (which is field dependent). Are you publishing? Are you presenting at conferences? Do you have teaching experiences? Have you received any grants? All those factors and more will probably make you stand out as a candidate more than the name recognition of your school. Unless your field is vastly different than mine, which is always possible. \n\nIf you\u2019re not happy with your program or your advisor, that\u2019s one thing. If you\u2019re chasing name recognition, that\u2019s your call to make, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth the disruption to your education.

I grew up in a town where one of the Ivy\u2019s is located and the running joke is that a masters from there means you\u2019re rich and an undergrad degree means you\u2019re rich but also more competitive than most of the country. I don\u2019t mean to call you out if you really badly want to go to this Ivy for grad school. But I do think it would be good for you to hear the reality that not everyone is going to immediately think you\u2019re smart if you go to an Ivy for grad school. By contrast, I picked a state university for grad school over the literal top private university in my field which also has insanely high name recognition simply because I didn\u2019t want to live in the location of the private school and knew that the state school was top 5 for my program. I\u2019m still extremely happy I did this, even though I also shared in your resentment that lots of people in the grade below me and outside of my field seemed scoff at the idea of me going to grad school at some random state school. I eventually just got over thst feeling because I realized their validation is worth about 30 seconds of dopamine, while the school I\u2019m at got me what was once my dream job and even more got me to grow up and aspire for even more than thst once I already had it. \n\nThis is a very long way of saying don\u2019t give a shit about validation from people who are so ill informed that they don\u2019t understand where you\u2019re at.",

There might be opportunities where you are now that you will not find elsewhere. \n\nEither path you take, it\u2019ll take you somewhere and take you further than where you are right now. Both will provide growth on your personal and academic life.\n\nIf I were you though, I\u2019d settle it by applying to the actual schools I wants to invest my time and money in.
