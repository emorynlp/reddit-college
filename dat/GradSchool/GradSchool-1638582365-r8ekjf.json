  "text": "Other than the few posts that I\u2019ve made, it seems that just about everyone is going through a hard time right now in their program. Now more than ever. Why is it happening? Is it because we are still trying to get adjusted to classroom life after doing online for a year? Is it because we are so close to the holidays? Why is everyone suffering right now?",

That means that my whole social support network is... not nearly as supportive as before and I am totally burned out. I've been on leave this whole semester but I'm still just as exhausted as I was before and have absolutely no desire to return to my program. I'm honestly considering dropping out instead of re-enrolling next semester and the deadline for this decision is fast-approaching. \n\nIt feels like traditional grad-school-as-bootcamp is just too much in our post-pandemic (or is it?) world of chaos and unpredictability. The pandemic led to a pretty drastic shift in priorities for me and now I just want peace, stability, and a solid work-life balance. Unfortunately, academia offers none of that - in fact it pretty much offers the opposite in my field.",

I don't know if this is a representative thing though.\n\nAlthough I am taking the final for the last class I have in the coursework for my PHD this next week and it's an amazing feeling to be this close to just getting to do my thesis work.",
