  "text": "Some grad school applications allow you to list professors at that school who you want to review your application. I have at least one professor in mind who I think would be good to review my application for that school because I'm interested in joining her research group. I've exchanged emails with her and she let me join their research group Discord and attend meetings, so I feel like she has a good impression of me so far since I've made an effort to get involved. So what's the etiquette around requesting specific professors be application reviewers?",
