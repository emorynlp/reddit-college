  "text": "I'm graduating this week with an undergrad degree in statistics. Unfortunately I fell 1 class short of a business minor, but I have 31 credits toward the minor. My advisor said I satisfied the minor. I did not. I'm not happy about it but I can't do anything about it at this point. I've been working full time through school and it'd be a mess if I needed to go for another semester.  \n\nI currently work in legal at an insurance company and I have plans to work as an actuary there. I'm already prepping to study for the exams. Prior to this I was an accounting clerk. \n\nI want to be an actuary or analyst and work in a management or consulting/leadership position.  I'm hoping to break 6 figures since I live in an expensive area and have an alright work/life balance. Any advise on the degree I should look into would be great. Currently looking into combination finance/ business analyst degrees or MBA programs. What do you think?",

You might want to get through them first, and then think about what you want to do next in terms of graduate work. As all that study will likely shape how you see your future career.",
