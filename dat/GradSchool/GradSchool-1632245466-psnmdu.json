  "title:": "Am I expecting too much from an email response?",
  "text": "So I emailed one of my previous undergraduate professors who wrote me a letter of rec to help me get into the grad school I wanted to get into. I graduated recently and told her about what has happened since I graduated and how things are going now. \n\nShe responded with a very very short reply and didn't really say much about how she has been doing. Only that I will do great in school... Literarily 3 sentences...\n\nNot sure if that's just the case because she is busy or what... but kinda hurts when you respected a professor so much and she just kinda writes you an unmeaningful response like that...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I expecting too much? I thought professors are thrilled to hear back from students like this.... :'(",

I feel like in my experience I usually have somewhat short responses, even from the professors I was closest with, but when I've seen them in person much later on we still have great conversations!",

Your relationship was a professional one, and has now concluded. Not everyone is interested in maintaining lengthy email correspondences with former students. You're expecting too much, here.",

They're used to the format being a work tool, rather than a social one.\n\nAs well, they spend eight hours (or more) working at their computer; they don't want to spend extra time writing up a long personal letter.\n\nAnd then some profs are just slow typists. Emails from them tend to be brief. My grad school supervisor had this issue. If one of his former students came by the office, he'd happily sit and chat for ages--but I don't think I *ever* saw him write an email more than five sentences long, to anyone.",

He was the first and last professor I ever wrote a thank you note to at the end of the semester my senior year. A month or two later I asked for his advice on selecting between two programs, detailing exactly what I want to do later in life (career wise) and the pros and cons of each program. He replied with a short, (I\u2019m paraphrasing here) \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have much knowledge of those programs.\u201d This dude is the head of the Analytics program and he doesn\u2019t know anything about Data Science or Comp. Sci.? Like hell, dude, the least you could do if give your opinion on which program would be more beneficial for my career. I didn\u2019t expect a lengthy response or anything. It just would have been nice if he cared a little more",
