  "text": "\\-Teaching 5, 1-hour classes one day of the week + 2-3 h meeting for TA discussion/ time students email for help\n\n\\-Another day is group meeting from \\~6-11pm\n\n\\-Then another collab meeting from \\~3-8pm\n\n\\-2+ hours of seminars/random meetings\n\n\\-2 presentations every 2 weeks (proof of at least 5 experiments with 100% knowledge and characterization of what you've done, of else you get yelled at! Assume 3-4+ hours on making presentations\n\nI do air-free chemistry so with my research you have to consider monitoring them/ at least an extra 30-90 min of set up to work/prep in air-free conditions.\n\nAre meetings normally supposed to be 4-5 hours long every week? Is it just me, or do I feel like I have no time to conduct my research in the lab or feel safe to present what I have done?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: this is for a phd and im in my 4th year",
