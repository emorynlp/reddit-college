  "text": "From reading some people's posts on here, I've realized that I lucked out with a great advisor. I was actually his first advisee and he is new to my school and fairly young, we are about the same age (I went back to school later in life). Anyway, he holds me and the other grad students to a high standard and expects a lot but also doesn't micromanage at all. If we don't deliver, he doesn't berate us, but you can sense the disappointment. And although he is invested in our thesis research and always willing to help, he is more concerned with finding out what our actual career goals are and prioritizing building skills/contacts for that as opposed to the tunnel vision that working towards your thesis can create. One time when we were overwhelmed with other coursework, my labmate asked him if we could take the week off from lab work and he agreed and thanked us for communicating our needs. It feels great to be in a healthy work environment. Just wanted to share.\nEDIT: wow thanks for the Silver Award, it\u2019s my first",

      "text": "My first PhD advisor was not very good at all. She was pretty hands off, but she was terrible at communicating expectations and even worse at providing useful feedback. She also backtracked a lot. For example, when I was identifying a target species to work with, I suggested one that would work well based on the literature and local needs. She agreed with me and told me to start writing up some research questions. When I sent them to her, she was like \"We never decided which species we were using. Why have you written these this way?\"\n\nEventually, one of my committee members directed me to a potential new project idea that might generate some funding. The whole committee (including my advisor) agreed it was a better direction for my research. A few months later, my program director contacted me to let me know it was ok to go a little while without an advisor, but I needed to identify a new one soon. Maybe 5 hours later, my advisor emailed me saying she couldn't advise my project because it had gone out of her realm of expertise. \ud83d\ude12 Like she could have said something during the initial talks about changing the project, and she could have told me first.\n\nI found a new advisor who is absolutely wonderful. She checks in with me, gives me useful feedback, makes specific and actionable requests, and makes me feel like I'm a good scientist and not a waste of air. She has my back. I regret that we aren't that close since she came into my life halfway through my degree.",

      "text": "I think my advisor is pretty great. He annoys me sometimes, but that\u2019s bound to happen with any two people working closely together. We are very different people\u2014I\u2019m young, female, dye my hair crazy colors, he is an old British man who dresses more formally than the situation requires\u2014but we get along really well. \n\nIn the few years I\u2019ve been working with him, I\u2019ve been able to be open with him about mental and physical health challenges affecting my work, and he is very understanding. He treats me like a person and we often chat about our actual lives, show off our cats to each other over zoom, compare notes on best teaching practices, make corny jokes, and vent about small academic annoyances. I feel like we have a genuinely friendly relationship that still lives very much in the professional realm. \n\nOne thing that I love about him as an advisor is that he never makes me feel dumb. I can admit ignorance about even basic concepts and he will explain. Sometimes it means I have to endure a ramble about how when we\u2019re thinking about this high level stuff we forget the foundations or something, but that\u2019s just his personality, it\u2019s not condescending. He writes things down at my request for later reference. He takes cues from me about whether I need direction or want to be independent. He apologizes if he thinks he was wrong or too harsh on me (although he is rarely too harsh). \n\nAnother great thing is that he simultaneously accepts where I\u2019m at and pushes me to go a little further than I think I can. It\u2019s just the right balance to keep me motivated without making me feel like a failure. \n\nI also see that he isn\u2019t done learning how to be a good advisor, despite his many years of experience. I admire his flexibility and that he can admit and learn from his mistakes. \n\nOverall, it was the fact that we could connect as humans and I was at least vaguely interested in his area of work that made me choose him, and I feel like I\u2019ve discovered a lot of other great things about him since then. I feel very lucky.",

I was too busy trying to experience life rather than focus on developing myself as a researcher until my 3rd year but my advisor never gave up on me. One day she called me into her office and asked me what's stopping me from doing research? And that was a huge wake up call. \n\nIt has been a slow journey picking myself up again and I have a long way to go but I couldn't have grown however much I have without the constant encouragement and support of her and my other lab members. They put aside their time to help me and I'm super grateful. I was encouraged to put myself out there be it conferences, writing papers, trying new experiments - I was always allowed to fail and learn and understand what it takes to get to the other end. \n\nHope someday when I get the opportunity I can pay it forward.",

They don't pressure me into overworking, doing too much research etc as they recognise that adjusting to a new program and taking lots of statistically heavy classes and learning new skills is difficult. But I know that once I feel ready they'll give me a ton of opportunities for research and publications. \n\nI think overall we click really well, we have similar views and skepticism over academics and academia in general and have similar styles of management etc. (hands off, supporting but not too domineering, give freedom for my own ideas).",

I would not be who or where I am today without her support and guidance as she was willing to mentored me and fostered in me a love of research and science. She is also an amazing role model who demonstrates poise, intelligence, and compassion with everyone she interacts with and is not afraid to show her humanity. I am not lying when I say that I want to be like her when I grow up. I get frustrated at times, though I feel that is inevitable in a high-stress environment. But she is always there for me to support, motivate, and challenge me. I know she will never read this so someday I will have to remember to tell her what she means to me. Though grad school is hard, and it sucks that others have a crap situation, I never forget how lucky I am. (Not to rub it in, just wanting to proclaim some appreciation, also helps me when I feel frustrated or demotivated)",

My advisor offered us money, which thankfully we didn\u2019t need, and then bought us gift cards to grocery stores. She\u2019s very encouraging of my ideas and always gets back to me really quickly. Our lab just hosted a (digital) conference and she really stepped back to let the grad students shine and expressed often how proud she was of what we put together. \n\nThat said, she\u2019s had a couple of students that had a terrible experience and warned me before I accepted my offer as a prospective a few years ago. I don\u2019t think their experience is invalid, I think my advisor and I just align on communication styles and level of involvement whereas the other students didn\u2019t. I guess why I bring that up is just that relationships with advisors are just that, relationships, and require work and compatibility.",

We work well together, because she prefers to be hands-off most of the time (unless one of her mentees asks for more structure), and I generally prefer that. If I need feedback on a paper or a proposal, she will take the time to edit and make comments line by line. She is also brilliant, and I feel very lucky to have a mentor like her, because she always pushes me (not in a mean way!) to do my absolute best work, because she believes I can be successful. That kind of support is huge to me when I have weeks where I feel stupid or unmotivated - she reminds me that things aren't linear and that I have to take advantage of the good times when I am super motivated, and if I do that, I will be okay. We've published together as well and collaborating with her was great, and we are hoping to have another paper ready by the end of the academic year. I like that she kind of lets me do my thing, but if I ask for help, etc., I know she will be there. I just have to cross my fingers that if my fellowship and grant applications fall through for next year (my main diss research year), she will find a way to make sure I have an income and health insurance.",

He makes sure all my work hours are paid if I get contracts, takes time to talk, answers all my questions and advises me on how to prioritize the MANY hats I wear. He tells me if he feels I get behind or overloaded according to my objectives. He also makes a point to involve me in his projets/ network and to get a proper phd student training that goes beyond the official requirements (get varied research experiences, teaching experience, organize congress, active in the research center life, etc.).",

It's like looking at Google reviews, people are more likely to review if they're pissed or had a bad experience. Unfortunately a lot of folks have had poor experiences with their advisors and come here to vent and ask for advice (not criticizing, it's reasonable!), but it leaves the impression that most advisors behave poorly.",

      "text": "Exact same situation here! I had never met my advisor (except for a brief 20 minute zoom meeting) before starting my program so I was really nervous about how we would get along. I can honestly say though that I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone better than him. \n\nMy university is 100% remote learning right now but he schedules bi-weekly zoom meetings with me just so that we can check in on my research but also just to chat. I know there\u2019s quite a few people in my cohort who haven\u2019t had any interaction with their advisor outside of a few emails so I count myself lucky.",

      "text": "Thats so nice to hear, I am happy for you :) .. Honestly in my opinion having a good advisor is the main goal through a person's graduate studies. You can't do without a good advisor even if you have great skills and great project. The advisor is the first major concern and you go from there. \nI am talking out of experience. I am one of the luckiest too, working with my advisor is a great journey, he is always addressing me as a colleague not a student although he is much older, but the idea is that we succeed together. :)",
