  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, \n\nWithout going into too many details, some things leaning towards discrimination have happened in my PhD. At first I dismissed it. Then today, I jokingly told a friend I wanted to file a title IX complaint against him, but then my friend seriously told me I should consider it. Out of curiosity, I looked into my PI\u2019s history, of his 53 PhD students he\u2019s advised over decades, including me, I\u2019m his first female PhD student. I can\u2019t help but think that at that point, it had to have been intentional because the odds of never hiring a woman before me is so small. \n\nA LOT of unfair treatment has happened in my PhD from my advisor that I don\u2019t want to get into at the moment, but I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone\u2019s escalated sexism/discrimination from their advisor? I don\u2019t really want to do it because I\u2019m in my final year.",

They should be able to help you understand your options without you losing control of the situation. That would help you decide if and when to take action against him without jeapordizing your degree and all your hard work.\n\nI'm really sorry, that's a crappy situation to be in \ud83d\ude15",

If so they should be able to direct you to a 'confidential resource' who is not required to report things but can discuss your options with you. You can be direct in asking, eg 'if someone were to discuss _type of issue_ with you, is that something you can keep confidential or are you required to report it?'",

I'm also saying this as a white, cis-het man, so I haven't really dealt with discrimination in practice (other than for mental health stuff). Theoretically, that's who I'd reach out to and going to them shouldn't commit you to reporting officially (there may be other options if you're worried about retaliation).\n\nAlso, I understand why you wouldn't want to \"rock the boat\", being in your final year. It's perfectly understandable and ultimately your choice. That said, consider routing something through the chain of command or proper channels or what have you anyway just so it's on folks' radar. If he is discriminating toward you, it's likely he'll do it again. Getting folks to take notice, something can be done about it. I mean, I hope. Like I said, all of my advice is theoretical.\n\nWhatever you choose to do, I hope you're okay. That's a shitty situation and you deserve a better. Hope some of that was helpful. \u270c\ufe0f",

If you\u2019re not sure whether you want to report or not you could ask about the process and see if that changes anything, or they might be open to having a hypothetical/off the record conversation. Your university may be required to investigate allegations of misconduct against staff, so be aware that you might not have a choice whether or not an investigation happens if you do choose to report. Most staff/grad students will be mandatory reporters, so you don\u2019t have many options for talking to someone off the record other than a school therapist or someone not employed by the university. At the end of the day it\u2019s up to you, I\u2019m afraid.",
