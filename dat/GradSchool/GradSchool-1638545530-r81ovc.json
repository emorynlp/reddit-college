  "title:": "Can I become an LPC if I'm a TLLP?",
  "text": "Title pretty much says it, I want to be a licensed professional counselor but the grad school I was planning on attending only lets you graduate with a temporary limited license in psychology. Would I be able to become an LPC if I didn't get my doctorate? I don't plan on getting my doctorate, it's not worth it with what I want to do. I plan on getting my master's and if down the line I want to I'll get my doctorate, but right now and probably for the next decade and a half after I graduate I want to be an LPC.\n\nThe state is Michigan by the way, and they require you to have a doctorate to be a psychologist.",

Counseling and psych are generally different types of training with different lenses of practice, so you wouldn\u2019t meet the educational requirements for an LPC with a degree in psych. Definitely reach out to somebody in the program you\u2019re looking at or the LPC licensing board before you make a decision though.",
