  "title:": "How to get motivated again and avoid burnout?",
  "text": "This week has been a rough one. I've been avoiding all my responsibilities and have really low motivation to do anything. I'm worried it's an indicator of burnout. We're only half way through the semester, so I need to find motivation again, because I can't fall behind as I'm defending in December and have a lot of course work due in November. What are ways that I can motivate myself again without burning out since I still have half a semester to go?",

      "text": "IME \"burn out\" has been equivalent to \"emotional fatigue\". For me, it's like a form of resentment from pushing aside personal needs/wants to focus solely on deliverables and other people's demands. In that case, the best solution for me has been to increase my emotional awareness and start prioritizing those personal needs so that I could genuinely refill my emotional reserves. It's a form a self-compassion and boundary setting that let me genuinely and enthusiastically say \"yes\" to tasks I want to do rather than just having to accept anything and everything that comes my way.",

      "text": "I'm in a similar situation. I'm severely lacking motivation. One thing I did was set up a workgroup within my department where we all meet over Zoom once a week for an hour and work on reading or writing for ONLY our research (no schoolwork or PI side projects). We also have a facebook chat so that if we find a resource we can post it, I use it for accountability too. So if I have a project I really need to make progress on, I tell the chat my goal and ask them to check in with my progress throughout the day. It's helped a little but I'm still lacking motivation.",
