  "text": "So my program does reviews at mid-term and end of each semester. It\u2019s basically you sit down for 15mins with the three main profs of the department (who I all have at least one class with) and they tell you what you are doing right, and also what you need to work on. I was honestly kind of excited for my first review. Mostly because I like to know where I stand and because I knew they would give me some good constructive comments to work on. \n\nUnfortunately I also had a big project that had to be done the same day and so the night before my review I had to pull an all nighter and got 0 sleep. I went into the review feeling fine and as they stated to talk I was also fine. My mentor spoke first and it was what I expected her to say, nothing super negative. Then the other two profs spoke and as it continued I could feel myself welling up for some reason. I\u2019m also just generally emotional, like even having a serious conversation can make me tear up a little. \n\nBut as soon as they were done they asked me a question about another class and I bursted into tears. I have no idea why, I think it was just the lack of sleep and someone genuinely asking me how I was doing that set me off. Afterwards I couldn\u2019t catch my breath and the remaining minutes were just them consoling me and me attempting to speak but being too short of breath to get much out. I apologized profusely and felt so bad because I felt super unprofessional and childish. I also really wanted to have a conversation about my work with them but we never got to it. \n\nAfterwards I also had to go back into my office that I share with the 9 other people in my program and face them as well. I am super embarrassed and I don\u2019t know how to move forward. I want these people to respect me the way I respect them and now I feel like I\u2019ve ruined it. How do I move past this? Do I reach out to my mentor and ask her about it? Do I let it go? I don\u2019t know.",

      "text": "I wouldn't be too hard on yourself for having an emotional reaction. Like you said, you were running on no sleep following a day of what I'm assuming was characterized by extremely high stress levels. \n\nWith that being said, sometimes emotional outbursts make people feel uncomfortable and yours could have caused people to question your capability to handle the high stress environment that is grad school.\n\nIt depends on your relationship with these people but maybe consider having a straightforward conversation with them to clear the air about what happened. And let it go, grad school is hard, I think these people know that. \n\nGood luck!",

Sometimes oppressive sadness and fatigue can be fixed with a trip to the gym, some fresh air, and good sandwich.\n\nGet some sleep and stay focused. Only way you put this in the past is by continuing to do good work that outshines the moments you\u2019re not proud of.",

Maybe not that exactly, but I think we can all sympathize with bursting out crying even in that position. Grad school is grueling, it drives us to our most vulnerable, and I would question those that say otherwise. \n\nChin up, tomorrow is a new day. You might want to explain yourself at a later time. Most professors understand how mentally draining it is.",

I\u2019ll offer advice on moving forward. \n\nYou said you\u2019re sorry, you can make amends through an individual or group follow up addressing how circumstances lead to your emotional reaction (you don\u2019t need to elaborate or provide many details) and ask if there is an opportunity to get feedback on your work, and most importantly try not to let it happen again. This may sound harsh but try to anticipate when you are going to be in a situation like this and prioritize preparing for it. That may mean sacrificing work and time spent on other tasks. I would advise you to take the day before, at LEAST half a day before, to relax and take care of yourself. You can\u2019t go into something like this with nothing in your cup. It exacerbates everything.",
