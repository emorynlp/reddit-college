Sometimes the difference isn't too easy to notice, and you wind up with multiple fonts and sizes throughout a document where you are citing a lot of other work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn LaTeX, all text is just text. There is one spot early in the document where you decided what font and size to have the entire thing be, except you can still change that for small sections where you want to, and again you tell it what section, what font and size, and that is all settled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdjust your margins to fit requirements in Word, and you have to go through and check every graphic to see if it is still on the page where you reference it, or even on the same page as the caption for it. Some of your graphics may no longer even fit in the print area if your margins made the print area smaller.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn LaTeX, you tell the graphics to try to be on the top/bottom of a page along with a specific section of text. The captions are part of the formatting for the graphic, and (if you do it right) you specified the size of the graphic based on the printing area to begin with, so if it was meant to take up the right half of the page, it still does, and it is even still aligned with the start of the paragraph you meant to have on the left half to accompany it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNumbering of chapters/figures/appendices are also all automated. So if you add or remove one in the middle, you don't manually adjust it all.  And anywhere you referenced those things also adjusts automatically.",

With a ToC, inline citations hyperlinked to the full ones, figure or table references again linked, the text within easy to copy and paste. Also smaller in file size. You can also add an inline ToC with a single command.\n\nAlso people can use whatever editor they like to modify/write the documents. With Word you're stuck with Word. LibreOffice Writer can deal with it only to an extent, AFAIK Apple Pages is not fully compatible either. But with LaTeX, I'm comfortable using Emacs, someone else can edit the same document using VS Code or Sublime Text, yet someone else might like Notepad++, etc.\n\nAnother benefit is, you don't have to copy and paste the files in. E.g. you generate a figure with R. In Word or similar, you'd import the file into the document. But with LaTeX, you just refer to the file name. So if you tweak the figure, it's automatically updated when you run the LaTeX build (PDF generation, that is). Same with code too. You can just reference files to be included. No need to manually update.\n\nAlso, because it is programmable, you can automate stuff. E.g. you can set variables for bits of text and use them everywhere. You have a constant that repeats a lot? Define a variable for it. You need to add some sort of diagram? Define a command for it (tho there probably is one ready made for you and shared no strings attached on CTAN).\n\nFinally a lot of things can generate LaTeX. E.g. SPSS, R, Pandas/matplotlib etc. all have ways to generate LaTeX output. So you can e.g. use R to run a test and write the resulting table into say \"regmodel.tex\", and refer to it for inclusion in LaTeX. If you tweak your stats, no need to manually edit.",
