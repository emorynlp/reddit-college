  "text": "I am applying for a graduate scholarship and was wondering if it was appropriate to ask my current master's supervisor (whom I have just started working with since September) for a reference for the scholarship. I can always ask a different professor from undergrad, but I was just wondering about this since the scholarship requires a letter of intent for the research that I will be working on.",

      "text": "Yeah, that should be fine. If they don\u2019t feel like they know you well enough they can always say no. Because this scholarship will be funding your research with this advisor I think they should be the first person you ask for a recommendation, and they will almost certainly say yes.",

I was nervous, but he said he was happy to write it and that you can get a good sense of someone's work pretty quickly. I got into my top choice program, so I assume it was a good letter!",

      "text": "I disagree a little with the previous two responses: I think it depends entirely on the scholarship.\n\nI sometimes help select fellows for a well-known U.S. graduate fellowship program. A letter from a supervisor that you've had for two months isn't the strongest letter. It's better than nothing, but I would rather see a new graduate student get a letter from their undergraduate advisors who actually know them and can speak with some authority about their work and potential as a scientist.\n\nThat said, some scholarships/fellowships really like to see a letter from the current advisor as a show of support. So I'd investigate a little with past scholars and/or the scholarship office as your university to see if this is one of those kinds of scholarships.",
