I honestly don't think I'd be doing as well as I have if I couldn't say, \"Boss, I've been super low this week and I'm sorry I haven't been as productive as I said I'd be.\"\n\nHe's very chill anyway, so I don't think he's treating me different than anyone else, but I still really appreciate it.",

I\u2019m not going to send paragraphs describing my despair at the world. He\u2019s my boss, not my gal pal, not my therapist. \n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t tell me intricate details of his mental health status either. If you\u2019re very, very open and the other person isn\u2019t equally as open then the relationship is lopsided and you\u2019re probably over sharing.",

I know he suffers from anxiety too and he's aware and supportive of my struggles with anxiety and depression. He's also aware that another labmate and I have ADHD and he doesn't treat us any differently as a result.\n\nI know some people that have a much more business relationship with their advisors and like it that way, but I'm thankful I can be open about it.",

      "text": "More open than I'd like to be, but it has its benefits. I'm in clinical psych, so it's definitely a somewhat unique situation, but there's still a lot of stigma within the field regarding certain diagnoses. And, of course, issues of competency to practice can come up with any severe mental health diagnosis. (\"Will it harm my client for me to provide therapy/assessments/etc. when I'm feeling XYZ way? If so, what do I do during those times?\")\n\nBecause of our field, when I had to open up to him about my own difficulties (which fall under the stigmatized and questionable competency categories), he was more interested in all the gory details of my symptoms, feelings, level of suicidality, etc than I think a standard PI would be. He does give me a LOT of wiggle room on things in general, while still helping keep me accountable, though. It's pretty nice.",

But in general, keeping things on a professional level serves us well.",
