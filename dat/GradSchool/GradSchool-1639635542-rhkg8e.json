  "text": "My official GPA from my university is a 3.1, but I took classes at a community college before coming to my current institution from which I will be graduating. My current institution only factors in classes taken at that university, so my community college grades don\u2019t have any impact. When I factor in the classes I took at community college, my GPA is 3.2. Is it dishonest to report this GPA that I calculated as opposed to the final GPA on my current institution transcript? I plan to send my transcripts from both institutions, so the committee will see a 3.1 at my current institution and a 4.0 at community college",

      "text": "I would say to put the gpa of whichever university you're obtaining your bachelors from. You have to send transcripts of anywhere that you were enrolled as a student, so they'll see everything. That being said (and depending on your field), your gpa isn't as important as you think. What's most important on graduate applications is your research/work experience (relevant to your field), your statement of purpose, and letters of recommendations. Hope this helps, and feel free to pm me if you have any other questions!",
