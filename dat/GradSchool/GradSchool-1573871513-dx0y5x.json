  "title:": "Lost and frustrated but not for the usual reasons. My university was besieged and evacuated.",
  "text": "I'm a PhD student from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For those that haven't been following the news, Hong Kong has been in turmoil for months as protests have been raging against the government. But amidst all the protests, the university campuses have been a safe haven for protesters (of whom a significant number are local university students), pro gov't supporters (mostly but not exclusively students from mainland China), and moderates from both sides. \n\nAll that changed this week. Student protesters began blockading major transportation arteries and the police in an attempt to remove them, besieged the university campuses. On my campus alone, the police fired over 1000 rounds of tear gas and the protesters fought back with Molotov cocktails, bricks, and road blocks. All the consulates have issued notices requesting international students leave Hong Kong immediately. The school term has ended weeks early. Most of my non-local colleagues have left for home in mainland China. \n\nI've been stuck at home for the past week and have been desperate to get back to campus so I can take out some of my research to work on my thesis at home. But beyond that I don't know what's going to happen next. I'm in my final year of study and was weeks from defending my thesis and finally graduating. I wanted to stay a few more months to finish the research I had going on and then find an industry job. I planned to get married at the hotel next to campus. I wanted to settle down back home in Canada. Now I don't know what do next. I'm just lost and frustrated.",

The school security staff have started preliminary safety assessments of the facilities and requested that we continue to await further confirmation so we can return safely.\n\nI\u2019ll be staying in HK for the time being and I hope to return to my campus ASAP so I can get back to work doing my research. I understand that the protests are happening beyond anybody\u2019s control and I don\u2019t want to assign blame for what happened on campus. I just hope that it can remain a safe space for everyone and a place where people can express their ideas and opinions openly without fear. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be alright as well.",

Historically, the main weakness of anarchism is a lack of robustness against foreign military pressures. It's not like society can't exist independent of the state. For what it's worth, anarchy doesn't mean there's no rules, it just means there's no involuntary hierarchies.\n\nThe climate change issue really is a major one and a lot of political theory fails to adequately address it. Some sort of mass central planning is probably a good bet, but unfortunately, ecofascism seems to be growing in popularity. I still think anarchism is an attractive goal, but there's just not a lot of time anymore, it seems.",

I think this very much depends on your field/faculty, and maybe being out of your campus is affecting your work substantially, but perhaps it is not. I assume you are not in Shatin for your safety. To me, HK, in general, is still a remarkably safe place - much safer than any Latin American country which has zero protests. If you do not agree, I would advise you to evacuate to any cheap place nearby - Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand. This is my plan B in case the situation deteriorates. For now, I do not feel it necessary.\n\nThe major problem is the uncertainty, the cancelations, etc. but we cannot manage it. But we can control ourselves and manage the risks. Following the media, however, affects many of my friends very much negatively. It seems you have done most of the things, but now could be a great time to do some writing (once you are physically safe) or do something whatever you find productive. But please do not waste your time and effort investing it in the panic. Either way, stay in touch with your supervisor and remain calm. Please forgive my cynism, but if all these political events are not your war, make sure you stay productive even if it is learning surfing or whatever. I know it is easier to say than to do and somewhat selfish, but my neighbor who went camping for a couple of days yesterday is not that mistaken. Again, only if this is not your war.\n\nAs for me, this is not my first protest in Hong Kong, and hopefully not the last one. Cheers!",

If the system is similar to what I'm experiencing in Canada - If you have the ability to get in touch with your advisors and/or committee, you should start there. If you have collaborated with anyone from outside the university (or country\ud83d\ude2c) see if you can get in touch with them. Make sure your network stays together in this moment. It's also probably the single safest thing to do. \n\nIn other thoughts, keep in mind that the phd process is about learning to become an independent researcher, it's not really about any specific project - becoming an expert is almost like a side effect. You're almost there (proving you've become one).",
