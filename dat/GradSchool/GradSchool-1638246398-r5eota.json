  "text": "When browsing though LinkedIn, if often see people with their graduate degrees/certifications after their name, for example, John Doe, MBA, CPA, etc. \n\nI understand putting PhD afterward because I suppose thats more mainstream, but what is considered too much/pretentious? \n\nIn a couple years I will have both an MS and MBA, so would it be appropriate to put \u201cJoe Doe MS, MBA\u201d? On one hand I could see it being useful for displaying to potential employers but on the other, I could see it come off a bit tacky. \n\nIm sure someone here has experienced something like this before, your thoughts are appreciated",

I think those credentials are already on one's profile and no recruiter/manager is clicking on some candidate's name solely because \"omg this person has an MBA, let's roll out the red carpet this is unlike anything I have ever seen before!\"",
