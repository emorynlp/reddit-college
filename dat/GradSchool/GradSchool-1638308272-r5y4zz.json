      "text": "I have gone on vacation the 1st week of January, before classes have started. After Jan 4th it's cheaper to fly because most people are done their holiday traveling by then. It's cold where I live so it was nice to escape the snow.\n\nAlternatively, I'll go the last 2 weeks of August. That's when a lot of the profs in my department go away so it's usually a ghost town.",
