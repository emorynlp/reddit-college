I instead stayed up late and after midnight (the day before) I started checking and the results were on the system already. \n\n All the best!!!!",

      "text": "Not quite analogous, but entertaining nonetheless: my first PhD admission came at around 6pm on a Friday, which was during the group dinner at the interview weekend for a top competitor program. I do not think this timing was a coincidence. It was, however, rather awkward because of the significant overlap in interviewees at the two departments.",
