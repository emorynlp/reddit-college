  "title:": "Is a PhD worth ending a long term relationship for?",
  "text": "I have been with my partner for 7 years, since freshman year of college, and we are 25 now. He's starting his 3rd year of a PhD program. He ended up not going to his dream school so that we wouldn't have to be long distance during my one year MSc program.\n\nI've been putting my goals of getting a PhD on hold lately for several reasons, definitely some burnout after graduating with my master's during the pandemic, but more importantly because there are no universities nearby his university that have labs aligned with my research interests. \n\nI've kind of given up on my PhD dreams, but lately I've been worried that I won't be personally fulfilled in life if I don't do it. I want to get a PhD in Europe rather than the US, most importantly because the research I want to do is much more common there and also because they are shorter.\n\nI asked my partner what he would think about me moving to another country and he basically said that he would not want to try long distance. He said that he supports whatever decision I make as long as it makes me happy.\n\nI really love my partner and can't imagine my life without him, but I don't want to have regrets later in life where I wonder how different my life would be if I continued following this passion. Anyone have any experience in this?",

      "text": "I speak as someone who has left a wonderful longterm partner for life goals and similar location differences. It was hard, but in the past decade or so I have built a new life in my new country, now have a career I love and an amazing spouse who is a more perfect match than the person I left even was.\n\nGiven how *young* you two are, and the statistic of 50% divorce rate and something like 60-70% of relationships will experience infidelity, it would be unfortunately not a safe bet the perfect, amazing partner you have now will be just as great in 5, or 10 years, or after life circumstances change. From 25, most people will change so much regarding what they want in life, and a sad fact, most people will want to still experience more partners before settling down.\n\nSo unfortunately, a very possible and even likely scenario would be you give up your dreams, career, idea for life in Europe, to stay with this person who you think now is an amazing match - you stay with them some more years with increasing discontent that your dreams/goals will now never be realised - and at some point, as is statistically so likely, one or both of you will cheat or grow emotionally distant and the relationship will fall apart. Then you will be 40, divorced, with no PhD, none of your dreams about living in Europe realized and now almost impossible to pursue, and a much crappier career than you wished.\n\nOr you could take the chance and take the leap to follow your lifelong dreams, and let the relationship evolve as it may. You could very likely build an amazing new life and career in Europe, and you will most definitely find another amazing relationship there as well. And you could live with no regrets, no wasted youth. Furthermore, he could be the one to realize that if he really loves you, he will follow you to Europe, or wait for you long-distance.\n\nOthers here are saying academia and grad school do not love you - this is true - but they also give you something that *no one* and nothing will ever be able to take away from you - your credentials, your education, and the experience you had doing it. It's far more unstable imo to rely on a single human to always be there for you and give you support, given how incredibly unstable and cheat-y and selfish and horny humans are just by their nature.\n\nTLDR: how can you give up such a substantial dream for the whims of an individual *person*, who may just as easily break up with you in the future? And in that case you will have no partner *and* all your dreams thrown away.",

It could be various unimportant reasons, but it does bring up the idea that you're past due to cut off a relationship that after a number of years isn't progressing.\n\n\\- Would he be willing to go with you to Europe in a few years after he finishes his own PhD (and you wait to start the PhD until then)?\n\n\\- Be honest: did he really give up his dream to keep from being long distance for a year, or is this some kind of line he's using to guilt you?  It just seems weird that he's fine with giving up a dream to avoid long distance for one year, but nonchalantly talks of breaking up if you go to Europe for a PhD program.\n\n\\- The seven years thing.  Again.  I know you're young.  But if you want to get married and after seven years he's still not down and he's saying \"fine, have a nice life\" when you say you want to do basically the same thing he's doing, this sounds like a shitty one sided relationship.",

It's not a big enough deal that I want to bring it up, though. He's so busy with his program that I feel like he doesn't have time to think of much else. I hope that we will get at least engaged once he graduates. I think he feels pressure to get a nice ring, which is not at all possible on a PhD stipend.\n\nWe talked again about how we will go about this and he said he will try to find a postdoc in Europe if I get into the lab I want. I honestly didn't think he would be down for this because he doesn't want to move away from the state we live in. To me that's a very big compromise to make so I initially thought long distance would be the only solution.",

I don't know you, but from the basics of your situation I would definitely advise you to prioritize your education/career over the forever boyfriend.\n\nEdit: LOL are any of the following true?\n\n* You mentioned your dreams and he called you \"irrational.\"\n* His \"dream school\" would have taken him out of state (where he doesn't want to go).\n* You also hoped he would propose after college graduation.\n* He never actually said that an expensive ring was holding him back, you just kind of made up the excuse for him.\n\nMaybe I'm being mean or petty.

      "text": "I\u2019m still lurking on this sub. I ended up finishing my masters and deciding not to pursue a PhD. I partly chose to do it because of health reasons and partly because it didn\u2019t make sense for our family. We wanted to have kids and even a program with a stipend wouldn\u2019t cover the cost of childcare.\n\nDo I regret it? When I\u2019ve had a sleepless week because the baby woke up every night and breakfast is taking forever to make alongside a screechy toddler, sometimes for a moment. But most of the time, I don\u2019t regret giving up 5 years of my life to undergo grueling studies for something that wouldn\u2019t guarantee me a decent paying job (since it\u2019s in the humanities). I look at the problems in academia today and now that I\u2019m a few years out, I am glad to not have to deal with them. I enjoy my time gardening and learning about the soil microbiome. We are launching a little free library for our neighborhood. We are working on sponsoring some refugees. These are pursuits I would not have time for if I were in a PhD program. I listen to audiobooks on my favorite subjects when I clean the house, and I actively support some organizations in the field so I stay in touch with those interests.\n\nMost of all, my children are 3 and 1 when I am 31. If we have more children as I get older, they will be old enough to provide help with their younger siblings. Their grandparents are in their 50s and 70s respectively. I am looking forward to being 40 and having trained my kids how to clean their grandparents\u2019 houses for them when they are 80 and too old to do so themselves. If we waited another 5-10 years to kids (with a PhD and then tenure track), we would be dealing with lots of baby care and lots of elder care all at once. So it\u2019s also obvious that I would have regrets if I took the PhD track instead. A diploma doesn\u2019t change diapers - whether for your children, your parents, or your own when you get to that point. Bracing myself for the downvotes now\u2026",

We're graduating next May and the 4 years with him have been so wonderful. We have both talked about long distance, as you never really know what the future holds. \n\nHe too does not believe long distance is feasible but has affirmed that he would be willing to give it a try and  supports my dreams. \n\nI have been lucky to find programs here in the US that are in the same coast but are not in the same state for my PhD and I have decided that if I did want to pursue further study elsewhere, I'll either apply for a postdoc in Europe or apply to be a visiting researcher there. I think collaborative work is very possible in the academic community without having to permanently leave your home base. \n\nWe have both discussed at length that we are alright with me leaving to go abroad for maybe 1 ~ 2 years but that 4 ~ 6 years away for a PhD may be too long. \nIt has been a good compromise and if I do get accepted into the PhD program in another state, we both agreed it would be good practice since I am a three hour train ride away. \n\nI love my partner and ultimately my dream wouldn't be a dream without him in it. \n\nYour partner sounds really supportive, and you both sound amazing together, and I think whatever choice you make will be something he will respect. \n\nI do agree that your dreams are extremely important, and it sounds like you've found your emotional support human. However, we need them to thrive in our PhDs too! \ud83d\udc9e There's no shame in that.",

We've ended up working out that I will apply when he is nearing the end of his PhD, and if I get in he will try to find a post doc position nearby. Us both being driven people definitely attracted us to one another, but I will say it makes things more difficult lol. If we can make it through then it'll only make us stronger and happier, though.",

      "text": "Relationships are all compromise. It\u2019s a two way street and everyone involved has to be on board understanding that. \n\nBiggest logistics questions are: Is there absolutely no one in the states doing the research you want to do, and if there aren\u2019t are you intending to permanently relocate to Europe? Otherwise that PhD focusing on that research can potentially be virtually useless in the states if no one is doing the research. Not because it isn\u2019t good science but because that means no one is funding it here.\n\nPersonal questions/considerations are things only you can answer. It sounds like he compromised on his PhD program some for the relationship. Would he be open to moving anywhere in the US after finishing his program, or is he not very open to that? Are you happy right now with your current career positions? If so, perhaps take a few more years for him to finish his program and get some post doc jobs out of the way, and when he is more firmly positioned in his career field reevaluate the situation. That would give him more to work with as far as being able to be more selective in his job selection and not just having to take whatever post doc positions he can find, and gives you some time to really decide if the PhD is something you actually want, and something you don\u2019t just want to be disappointed about not getting.\n\nPhD\u2019s aren\u2019t easy, but many people that don\u2019t have one could get one. The biggest hurdles always seem to be emotional and mental tolls (I\u2019m sure you\u2019re perfectly aware of those though, as your partner is doing one).\n\nI would just suggest making sure you really think it all through and don\u2019t do something rash simply because you\u2019re scared of how you\u2019ll feel in a few years, and not waiting to see if that\u2019s how you\u2019ll actually feel. There is no time or age limit on getting more education. I wish you the best!",

I've definitely been on the receiving end of this sort of situation (my partner being more career driven and the relevant consequences of this). So I guess I can only give my personal experience/opinion. I definitely did not resent him for being so serious about his career and wanting to focus on his personal development- after all, it's an aspect of what made me fall in love with him! However, I think once he realised that he wasn't ready to settle because the needs of the relationship could simply not be accommodated, he already knew that in the choice of me vs pursuing other goals he would not compromise his own pursuits. I think once you as an individual reach that point, it should be transparently communicated and acted upon. My ex's unwillingness to lose me meant that I was effectively lead on through a period in which he was already half checked-out of the relationship (sort of mentally-wrestling with himself even though there was really only one possible outcome), only for the relationship to end anyways. Relationships come and go, and good for you for having personal ambition. You may find yourself resenting your partner later if you use them as the sole reason for not pursuing this PhD path, which is unfair on both of you in my opinion. You know yourself and what is of more relative importance to you and your happiness, that's just my input :)",

It turned out to be the right thing - we went in very different directions in life and we are now both happily married  to different people.",

If it's a PhD, so be it, if it's your relationship, so be it. \nI don't think there's any choice that you make right now that you won't look back at in a decade and wonder how things would have turned out if you had picked the alternative. But, I think whatever you end up choosing will be easier to live with if it's 100% based on what you truly want. \nAll the best with this, as this is really a crossroad no one wants to be.

There were some other factors which made it hard though. It happened right at the beginning of COVID so I had to sort that out alone in a new city during a pandemic. \n\nMy point is that at the end of the day you are your own human and can make whatever decisions you want. But think about how they impact others, especially those that have made sacrifices for you. \nYou can still choose to leave, but at least be cognizant of how that might affect your partner.",

I truly wonder if this relationship is worth all these ultimatums. \n\n25 is young, to be honest you can easily recover from breaking up or from waiting to go to graduate school. A good number of grad students are near 30 or in their 30s. If I were I your situation I would've ended it to let him pursue his dream school and prioritize myself after that. In this situation, I would rather go to a good graduate school. You have your whole life to fall in love, you dont have your whole life to go to school, build skills, get published and gain experience.

It\u2019s very rare that one person can have absolutely everything they want in life without requiring that others make sacrifices and suffer. In stable relationships, both parties make informed sacrifices so that both parties on average get something they\u2019re happy with.\n\nOP\u2019s partner compromised and chose a closer PhD programme that he was okay with in order to support OP in attending her dream Masters programme. Now it is OP\u2019s turn to offer a compromise - a delayed start to let her partner finish his PhD programme, or maybe a closer programme in the US that she would be okay with. \n\nIssuing an ultimatum like \u201cI will go to another country right now and you can either come with me or go away\u201d is no more mature or healthy than \u201cI refuse to consider any situation where we do not continue to live in the same house at all times\u201d. In both, compromises could be made. Maybe moving today is too soon but in 2 years it\u2019s fine. Maybe 30 hours of travel is too much but 1 hour is acceptable. And both are strange ultimatums to make in a stable, healthy, adult relationship, and neither partner should make them unless they are happy to follow through on their threat. And I personally believe that being able to make such a threat does indicate that the relationship is weak, or at least too weak to bother compromising. Like you\u2019re just a fair-weather partner. And that\u2019s fine, you can be that, but you have to accept that it\u2019s a weak(er) relationship. \n\nAs others have pointed out, if literally no one in the US does what she plans to do then she cannot possibly hope to live in the US since she cannot possibly hope to find a job with her worthless (to the US market) PhD.",

I really did like my ex and have not found someone that I connected with the way I did with them in this past year, plus some change, of being single, but I'm sure it will come. Like other people have said. The whole process has really shown me that I don't want to put my life on hold for someone else, and I don't expect anyone that I date to just be okay with me moving to the next place when I am done with this program. There are more times that I am happy to be single than having to be responsible for a relationship. This feeling always comes over me when I am stressed from the life that comes with being a grad student. \n\nSpeaking in a more general way, I have found there are a lot of people to meet in your program/different grad programs and even surrounding area that might have some thoughts on dating and life that might line up much better with your life in grad school. \n\nAll that being said, forsure make this decision on your own. A number of people in my program are engaged, married, and a few having kids. Speaking from someone who was heart broken when dumped, no one should stay in a relationship because they would feel bad for leaving. It is your life, do what you need to do. I would say that no one is so great or so important that someone couldn't find something better out there.\n\nEdit: can't spell",

Maybe this provides some insight into your relationship and can help you decide what to do. \n\nMaybe you can have a serious discussion with him about what you want to do in life and see how he responds (if you haven't yet). Sometimes when people understand the significance of something, they are more open to accommodating it.\n\nEdit: I think this goes without saying, but you should be open minded in the conversation too. If he really needs a support system while he is in school for example, I think that would a valid reason for him wanting you to stay. Compromise is a thing in relationships.

If they're are so uncaring about the relationship as to run away to Europe and can't wait, then they don't truly love their partner. If their partner can't do long distance for a year or two before coming over with them, they don't truly love their partner.

How we *feel* in the moment is not necessarily the best thing for us. As an extreme example; how many people in abusive relationships stay because they \"really love the other person\"?

For me, my partner means the world to me. I love him more than anything else in life and I am SO EXCITED to go through all these adventures and stages in life with him (I get all giddy just thinking about it!). My career is extremely important to me, but I would never ever leave him to pursue it. We are at a point in our relationship where this sort of question isn\u2019t even an option. We will stick together no matter what. And that may include a compromise where neither of us gets what we want. But that\u2019s what relationships are. My dream is pursuing life with the career I want WITH my partner. There are lots of careers and jobs out there, but only one guy I connect with so well and love so much. But that\u2019s my opinion.
