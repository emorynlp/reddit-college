  "text": "In the middle of my second year, I asked a guest lecturer about her results because I didn't really understand the method, and was confused and wanted to learn more. Mostly the latter, because I was just generally curious and I sometimes miss things in seminars.   \n\n\nI'll never forget her explanation, which was: \"That was a poorly thought question you asked. What you should have asked was...\" and I dont remember anything after that because I kinda just blacked out.   \n\n\nIve never asked a question since then, because I dont want to embarrass my bosses. However. I have some interviews coming up and I dont want to embarrass my stupid ass again and fuck up someone interpreting someone elses work.   \n\n\nAnyone have any suggestions? A lot of the people I'm going to meet with are in a fairly different field.",

Ask questions again maybe in smaller settings then work your way up again. Listen to questions others are asking.\n\nDon't let an ass keep you from learning and advancing yourself.",

This is not my field so I can't offer anything to help regarding the question, but I never understand the superiority complex of some. Answering the question ELI5 style is even better than what they did. Best of luck in the future",

          "text": "My question was regarding enhanced sampling techniques. I dont remember the exact context anymore, but ill assume you're not a chemist and explain the technique.   \n\n\nIf youre trying measure the topology of a mountain so to speak, imagine starting at the bottom of the mountain and taking a step in a random direction. Each time you take a step, you drop a square brick down and write the (x,y) coordinate of that brick. you repeat this process until you have bricks surrounding the mountain, as tall as the mountain. So if you wanna know how tall and wide the mountain is, you just reference all the bricks location, and how high each brick was, and how many you had to stack at each coordinate.   \n\n\nIn Molecular Dynamics, these \"bricks\" are actually just bais potentials, and the \"mountain\" is the behavior of some system. We use this method to look at something called a Free energy surface, which can tell us where systems are, where they would like to be, and where they can/cant go. going back to the mountain example, imagine if on the North face, the only way to the summit was a 3000 ft sheer cliff. Well you're probably not going up that way. this technique can capture those features of our systems and is really important in many applications  \n\n\nthe speaker had some really weird shaped bricks and my question was along the lines of: \"those are interesting bricks, how did you come up with those?\"   \n\n\nIn the speakers defense, that is a very, VERY dumb question to ask.   \n\n\nP.S. if you are a chemist im sorry for explaining something you already probably know. also i wouldn't take my explanation of the technique as gospel because I really don't know a ton about this method. Im confident i made some mistakes in that explanation",

Metadynamics in particular is most intuitively explained graphically (or especially with an animation) so it can be difficult to put it into words. If I were to give you some advice for communicating ideas like these to outside audiences, I would say to resist the urge to bring up phrases like \"free energy surface\" or \"bias potential\" and stick to analogy, as short and sweet as possible.\n\nEnhanced sampling is definitely a difficult subject to teach yourself. I remember feeling like I must be really annoying my advisor when I kept asking her to explain things over and over again, though to her credit she was very patient with me. My suggestion is to find someone who understands these concepts and get them to help you. A little direction can be invaluable. I'd be happy to help too!\n\nUmbrella sampling is by far the easiest method of those you've mentioned to learn, so if you don't understand any of them yet, you should definitely start there.",

Especially if you are trying to make population-level inferences, people are going to be very critical of the way your sample was obtained and the methodology used because it could have significant implications on the data and results. \n\nThis guest lecturer should have anticipated these questions and learned to behave themselves more professionally. If their sampling method was confusing, it's probably because they did a shit job explaining it. I typically phrase questions like \"I am really interested in \\[thing\\], could you explain a bit more about how you found \\[thing\\]?\". If someone reacts poorly to that type of question, I don't find it at all necessary to change the way I ask that type of question because the problem is with them, not me. \n\nThis kind of behavior is also a big red flag to me, and a sign that more deeper questions should be asked about their research in general. Good, valid, research is transparent. People who are trying to hide skullduggery and malfeasance often react negatively to common methodological questions.",
