  "text": "I am currently almost finished with a degree in IT with a minor in computer science concentrating in cybersecurity. I think security, the technical and theory behind it, is very interesting. It is a crazy good field right now with a good salary and job opportunities, but I always had my eyes on obtaining a PhD for a couple of reasons:\n\n1) I value knowledge and education alot. I love to learn and have an extremely deep understanding about something, the whole appeal of \"being an expert\" speaks to me\n\n2) My dream career is a professor/researcher. I would love to publish groundbreaking research in the field of security and teach in a university.\n\nI know I can skip masters and go right into PhD, I currently have a 3.55 GPA and will most likely graduate cum laude. Just to get a feel for research, I opted into an undegrad honors thesis program. It isn't as deep as an actual masters or PhD dissertation, but gives me the opportunity to pick a topic, conduct research online and experimentation (and collection of data on my own). Currently writing about reinforcing MySQL databases. I am really enjoying it, and think compiling/writing my own research is kind of fun. Although it definitely isnt as deep as a true dissertation, I feel like I'm capable of producing a thesis.\n\nI'm conflicted on what I should do or if grad school even is for me. Someone suggested working a few years to save some money and gain experience and to truly see if I want to pursue a PhD. Does anyone have any opinions on the matter to help me decide?",

      "text": ">I know I can skip masters and go right into PhD,\n\nYou're not really skipping a Masters. The Masters is essentially the first two years coursework of a PhD with a thesis or comps thrown in. If you had already completed a Masters in the discipline, and were going for a PhD after, you would not have as much coursework to do.",

          "text": "Everyone around me says to do what you love, a career I would love and wouldn't mind waking up for would be a professor/researcher. Teaching large university lectures, publishing research, having my name in the industry. On the other hand, I don't know if I'm cut out for PhD level work, could be impostor syndrome playing a role. \n\nI don't mind being in an office climbing through the ranks eventually being CTO or something along the lines of that, but I think if I had to choose purely on which one I would enjoy more I would go the professor research route",
