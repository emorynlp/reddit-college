  "text": "Hi all- \n\nI am currently applying to graduate schools for my MPH and am having a difficult time writing my statement of purpose. I've had a couple of drafts edited by those with admissions experience, but it's beginning to feel like less and less of my own words. The biggest problem for me is I feel like it's very generic and lacks context. I wish I could add SO much more, since I have a long CV, but given the word count, it's challenging. Due to this, I'm having difficulty conveying my passion through text and don\u2019t really know where to go forward from here. \n\n-How do you convey your message through your statement of purpose when you have a long CV? every work or research experience has been influential in the work I do leading up until now. \n\n-How many experiences should you highlight/focus on? \n\n-How do you highlight the bigger picture through text given a limited word count?",

Then develop content to support that using your experiences.\n\nIn other words, experiences are the evidence to support claims about yourself. Of course, don't make claims that are not supported by experience.",
