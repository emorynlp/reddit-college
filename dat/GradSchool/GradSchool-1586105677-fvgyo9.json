  "text": "Does anyone else feel this way? I cannot be productive whatsoever from home, no matter how much I try. I can squeak out an hour here and there of productivity, but then I fall back into either gaming/netflix/reddit. It doesn't help much of my work is lab based, and there's only so much I can do from home, as I don't have enough data for a publication at the moment. My cohort is raving about all the work they are getting done, but (at my program) that could all be a smokescreen.\n\nAnd then there's the hundreds of articles of people being even more productive working from home than the office. I really wish I could learn their secrets. I've spend years making home a no work environment to foster a healthy work-life balance. Now upturning that is causing problems!",

It helps to get you in the right mindset of working. It also helps to have a dedicated space in your house to work so you associate that spot with working. It also helps to schedule your day just as you would at work. Break down what you need to accomplish into small tasks and schedule them on your calendar and try to stick to that schedule. It is really easy to have no structure at home so you have to create your own structure so you can get shit done. Look into the pomodoro method too.\n\nBut for reals though, I agree with others that if your productivity is lower during this crisis then it is not the end of the world. Even if you can schedule an hour or two in the morning to write and read then you will at least be getting stuff done and you can enjoy the rest of your time guilt free. Maybe use the time to catch up on other things you need to get done.",

      "text": "I'm going to be blunt and this is more in response to the hundreds of equivalent posts I've seen in this subreddit over the last week so don't take it personally because it isn't meant to be personal.  This is something I struggled with and had to get past so I'm not going to pretend it isn't a problem...because it is, and its something you need to address.  As to those saying \"well if you are a lab worker makes sense you wouldn't work if you are not in a lab\" I'd say no to that, people generally don't get PhDs to be lab workers all their lives, generally they at somepoint want to have some leadership role and it is hard when you are doing lab work in grad school to learn those skills like grant writing or contracts or patents or other skills that are part of the career path.  Now is a good chance to dig into that.\n\nBeing able to work independently is basically the most important skill you should (and basically have to) leave your PhD with.  People get really focused on getting publications or particular experiences or connections and that is all important too, but if you don't learn how to self-motivate you are going to fall flat on your face in an actual work environment away from the weekly check-ins and the feeling of basically being watched by your advisor.\n\nThere is nothing different between a home work environment and an actual work environment where you are senior enough in your position to not feel like you are being watched.  So if you envision a future of being a PI or a manager in industry and you can't work at home then you have an issue you are going to need to address. I get as a grad student you feel like you are being watched and that if you sat in your cubicle or at your lab bench surfing the internet instead of working people would notice and think less of you.  But if you end up leaning on that as s your sole source of motivation to work, you are shooting yourself in the foot and need to work past that.  You need to do some soul searching and figure out what you actually want to be doing with your life and make sure that that is your motivation, not that someone might see you not working.  What motivates you to \"do\" things when you aren't being watched.\n\nIf you lose all motivation to work when you are at home then to be honest your motivation is most likely just that you want to be seen by others as working.  Then its not really suprising that when put in an environment where you aren't being watched by others you lose all motivation to work. Here is the thing though, if you want to be a PI, or a senior scientist, or a manager in industry or other positions that would require a PhD (presumably what you are going for if you are getting a PhD)...those positions FEEL like you are working from home because you are the boss, no one is hovering over you.  If you don't learn that self-motivation ability now, when you have some safety-net in the form of training grants and a lab that supports you, you are going to drowned when given a position where you are expected to just to it all yourself.\n\nSo how do you make that transition?\n\nRemind yourself why you wanted to get a PhD in the first place, presumably it was at some point a self-motivated thing...you were excited by X and you wanted to learn more about that.  Take a few days, maybe step back a bit and try to rekindle that....think about what you really want to be doing and then recognize now you have some time to be doing that.  Come up with your  own schedule, one where you get to work on the things you've been meaning to look into and expand.  Divide your days 50% the things you want to read up on and 50% the things you need to be working on for your job.  That already is better than doing nothing but web surfing.  Use your own motivation to help motivate you to do the other work as well. Do the work you want to do, mix in some of the \"busy work\". Of course there will also be work you have to do that you don't necessarily want to do, that will always be true out in the working world as well....that is more about just building up willpower which is another skill that is more important than a publication record.  You will need to learn how to work when no one is watching if you want to grow beyond just a lab worker, now is your time to practice those skills.",

I am sympathetic I had to go through that transition as well, learning how to be an independent worker is difficult but it is necessary for careers that a PhD prepare you for. Pretending otherwise might give a feel good moment but it isnt actually helpful. It's not that I dont care or dont have empathy...I'm not annoyed by people struggling with this I'm annoyed by people acting like its totally fine.  No, it is something that needs improvement and it's an issue that does deserve attention and although this situation is terrible in many ways its actually a rare opportunity as a lab grad student to focus on learning the time management and independent work skill sets you may not otherwise have had time to learn. Not only that but learning how to work through existential dread...which believe it or not also pretty important to learn.\n\nWasnt trying to be \"up high\" I said I struggled with that as well but it is something worth working on. The fact I was able to work past it was meant as encouragement that others can as well and it's not insurmountable. I agree its important to be sympathetic with those struggling with a difficult situation but I disagree a \"there there its okay\" approach is actually helpful.  Because it's not okay, it's an issue that it's good to identify if you have so that you can work on it before it becomes an issue when you pursue your career.",

Being paralyzed by anxiety is something I can have empathy for but it isnt something I should support....because its not good.\n\nWhat is your suggestion about what should be done about paralyzing fear or anxiety? Acceptance? Giving in? I think it's worth fighting and it is something you can change...it isnt insurmountable. They can do it...you can do it...support is needed but support isnt just acceptance.\n\nYour work is of value and believe it or not focusing on it will help not hinder both those around you looking for support and reassurance and for yourself looking for something to focus on. Fear isn't something to just collapse into...that wont make you feel better.\n\nAs for this being a unique situation that is certainly true, but it isnt a unique feeling. Being a PI basically feels like working from home while often being filled with existential dread not only for yourself but for those depending on you. Naturally that is completely paralyzing and it's only through practice and diligence that you learn how to work through it. Call that being in a bubble or being inhuman if you want, wouldnt be the first time a PI got accused of that.",

I get that when someone is in the midst of dealing with it it seems harsh to say that but honestly in grad school, being forced to work from home with less expectation that you will continue to be productive is an excellent time to be working on what really is a needed skill.

      "text": "As someone who worked from home most of the time even before the quarentine, I've found that task-based work schedules tend to be more effective. Since you're in a place where you can shift between work and rest anway, might as well build that into your routine than try to fight against it.\n\nHere's what I've found to be an effective process.\n\n1) Night before, select tasks you wish to do. If there are clearly descrete chunks (read an article/chapter, outline a section, ect) do that. If they're   a larger number of shorter tasks (enter data) then select a number to accomplish. Ideally you want to have tasks that take the amount of time you comfortable tolerate. A popular one is 25 minutes, but I find that 1-2 hours is good for me. For this, I usually try to do anywhere from 3-5 tasks a day\n\n2) Day of, get yourself situated. Having a clear goal and an end in sight really helps with the willpower issue, but you'll still need a bit of discipline to get started. I've found that if you like what you're doing and planned well, the need for discipline only lasts as long as it takes to get warmed up. If you still need to push yourself after 5-10 minutes, then you probably aren't being clear on what your task is and should focus on clearly defining it.\n\n3) Once you're done, take a break. You can time it out if you like, but usually I find that I'll start to get antsy after a while. Don't resist your anxiety- its only telling you that its time to get back to work. Thank it for it's service and get back to its\n\n4) Once you're done, reflect on your day- what went well? What didn't? Ehat needs to be done tomorrow? Use that feedback to do step 1 again\n\n5) Deliberately put down the work. Once you're done with your tasks, you're done. Use step 4 as the ritual substitute for leaving your lab. Leave your concerns in your notebook and take the rest of the night off\n\nAnyway, like other people said, don't worry about it too much. Just do the things you can. I doubt anyone's gonna be too upset if your productivity drops a bit during a pandemic. Or at least, no one you wa t to spend much time with",

Many people have lost their jobs during this crisis, and I think if we are lucky enough to keep our jobs, we should be trying hard to get something productive done. If you work in a research lab, there must be plenty of literature reading you can be doing at home. Write a fellowship just to write a fellowship. You don't really have to turn it in, but having an end goal can help you guide your work and feel like you've accomplished something. Or, you could write and submit a literature review. \n\nI empathize with all my fellow academians who have trouble working from home.

                  "text": "Had someone refer to my previous post as a tirade, honesty I felt I was being restrained.  Now I'm starting to get actually rather mad.\n\nYes, this is a crisis.  A crisis is a time where it is more important to be active and involved and help.  There are basically four situations out there right now.\n\nSituation 1 is a person whose work was deemed non-essential and they were layed off or furloughed.  Suddenly they have no income and have to seek government assistance and/or unemployment which in itself can feel like fulltime work.  The time they do have left is probably spent pinching pennies and trying to be as frugal as possible.  I have a lot of sympathy and hope they receive the help they need.\n\nSituation 2 is a person whose work was deemed essential.  Chances are they are in a high risk situation, working double shift and getting no additional pay.  People like hospital workers, grocery store clerks, delivery people.  I have a lot of sympathy (and pride) for those doing this.\n\nSituation 3 is a family whose children are no longer in school or daycare because they were closed and now have to provide the care themselves likely in addition to their jobs.  Child care is a full time job, so for parents who are still working and now having to provide child care its overwhelming.  This is the situation I am in, so of course have lots of sympathy.  As an example of this my wife gets up at 5am and starts working.  She works until noon.  I get up at 6am and get the kids up, cloth them, feed them, give them some exercise, a lesson, feed them again.  Then at noon I start work and I work until 9pm.  I stop and am on kid duty (they are in bed but occassionally cry need attention) and my wife goes back to work working until 11pm and then goes to bed.  I have a little time to do some cooking and cleaning and houeshold chores before also going to bed.  On the weekends we still have fulltime job of childcare but also pretty much all of the household chores are shoved into the weekend.  We do grocery shopping for the week for ourselves and also for our parents so that they don't have to go out to a public area where lots of people convene (they are higher risk).  I also work during the weekend because my buisness was considered essential by the state and is still in operation.\n\nSituation 4 is quite rare.  This is the person whose work was deemed non-essential so they were sent home but yet they still get to keep their job and they still receive pay.  What I hope these people do is use that time to continue their work as best they can and if they literally cannot or it feels like what they are doing is not actually helpful then there are plenty of people in situation 1,2 and 3 that really could use some help right now.  I have sympathy for this group as well, but there is a gradation here and it is really difficult to muster a lot of sympathy for someone who has a really hard time not spending a lot of time surfing the internet right now.  And if the response is that of \"what can we do\" if you really don't know its hard to feel like you just aren't looking.  There is a ton of things that healthy adults in a low-risk category who have free time can be doing right now to help.\n\nNo one has it easy right now so I have sympathy in general.  But honestly if your complaint right now is it is difficult to keep busy it is hard not to get a little frustrated in your general direction.   I know in this subreddit there is a lot of support right now for just hunkering down and weathering it out and not worrying about it if you aren't being productive or working...but honestly fuck that.  Most of you are able-bodied adults.  Help.  Think I'm being a dick to say that?\n\nPicture someone in a hospital worker subreddit coming over here to share their story of 16 hour shifts having one mask to their name knowing full well they are likely going to get sick between the exposure and the stress/sleep deprevation all while getting no additional pay.  Bet there would be a lot of sympathy given towards them from those in this subreddit yeah?  Now imagine someone from this subreddit going over to the hospital worker subreddit to share their story of how difficult it is to motivate themselves to work and how they end up spending so much time just sitting around worrying or surfing the internet.  How much sympathy do you feel they are going to get?\n\nFind it difficult to work right now?  Volunteer at your local grocery store to handle grocery deliveries for the elderly in your community.  Go to the Red Cross and volunteer your time, they are dying right now.  Give blood, although coronavirus doesn't require transfusions lots of things that are still happening do and the well is running dry.  Can you sew?  Sew masks and provide them in your community or at a local hospital.  If you can find aspects of your job to do, that is good too...maintaining your work is going to help in the long run as it will help maintain jobs for other people who are no longer employeed to come back to.  But do something.  Nothing beats the existential dread and malaise like keeping busy.",

After a few days, stretch them to 90 minutes and see how that goes.\n\nUse the last 15 minutes of each work session to plan what you're going to do in the next 90 minute chunk.
