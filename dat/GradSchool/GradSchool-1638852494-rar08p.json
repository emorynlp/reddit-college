  "text": "I proposed my thesis on Wednesday last week and it got accepted, but I have no motivation to do it. I have no motivation to carry on with school. I just finished off this semester and have one more in my MS program and I don\u2019t want to go on. I\u2019m dealing with some personal issues that my older brother said he dealt with when he was my age and it is affecting me a lot more than it did him, obviously. I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to succeed but what\u2019s the point anymore? Please give any advice you can. I\u2019ll expand on what it is if you need to know/ask.",

The other thing to consider is whether pushing on when you\u2019re not in the best frame of mind will reflect in your grade. You don\u2019t want to do yourself a disservice after all your hard work just because you\u2019re having a hard time right now.  I think people in academia struggle to ask for help - I never had an extension in my life until my masters dissertation was due, but if I didn\u2019t get one, I almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have completed or I would\u2019ve gotten a terrible grade. Extenuating circumstances, deferrals etc are there for a reason. In 2, 5, 10 years\u2019 time you won\u2019t look back and care that you completed a term late, but you almost certainly will look back and regret either quitting or getting a grade you feel ashamed of when you could\u2019ve done better. Don\u2019t be scared to ask for help. Your tutors want you to succeed.",

      "text": "I just passed my dissertation defense yesterday after months of feeling this way (and helping raise two kids while caring for a pregnant wife). Here are some things that might help:\n\n-Your advisor(s) wants you to succeed. \n-if you're already contemplating thoughts of suicide, seek a professional now. They can help.\n-You are the only one who can do this. This is no one else's responsibility. That's liberating ina. Way, because you don't have to worry about what anyone else thinks of things until the last minute. You have the liberty of managing your time as you see fit.\n-Stop staying up late. Write while your mind is at it's most refreshed. I found it helpful to go to bed early and wake up early to do my writing.\n-Avoid stimulants (e.g. caffeine) or alcohol. And get 8 hours of sleep so you don't need stimulants either. If you become dependent on stimulants, your budget will evaporate faster, and as a student, you can't afford the financial burden on top of everything else you have to do.\n-Schedule time to feel like a human being. Get together with a group of people regularly to do activities you enjoy. I'm a board game person. I go to church once a week, and serve in a children's group there. Doing these things helps me to get out of my depressed spirals and do something that other people will appreciate, and help generate the kind of praise and motivation that keeps me going.\n-don't do it as a sprint - build up to it over time. The last week will bstill be a sprint, but the prep you put into it ahead of time will pay off and give you peace of mind leading up to it. \n-find people who are willing to listen to you whine and who give good advice. While it is all you, you're not alone. You can lean on others for strength.",
