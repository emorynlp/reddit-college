  "text": "Hi all.\n\nIf a prospective student for an MS program (this pertains to other STEM majors) has had to re-upload a cv or correct the submission of a transcript upon finding out the original document they submitted will not be acceptable, is that a red flag? Would it hurt the students chances of getting into the degree program if every other part of the application is ultimately well put together? I'm just wondering if they'll view it as poor attention to detail and how much thar perception would damage me.\n\nThanks!",
