  "text": "Hi! We came back to college this semester and the exams had been veey different for what we were already used. My gpa dropped from 9.05/10 to probably 8.8/10 in the worst of the cases. There's still 1 year left for me, but I'm not sure how I'd be doing since I'm starting an intership at Visa. I don't know if this will help strenghten a bit my profile. I really hope I can get into a Master programn in ESSEC, since it's one of the best grad schools in Europe, but I don't know if this gpa is good enough.",
