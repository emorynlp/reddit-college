  "text": "I am writing a review paper about a certain alternative food source that, despite being researched a lot for individual healthful properties for in vitro animal studies, has not been studied much for fppd application purposes. I admit my draft was pretty garbage-y because I myself wasn't sure what to write, but its no less frustrating when half the comments said \"this is irrelevant to topic\" to all the possible nutraceutical/bioactive properties that I wrote to support why this food could be the next novel ingredient. How can I write a review paper about the food's *application purposes* when so little has been done in respect to typing its chemical properties to specific application?? I don't know what my advisor wants. Sigh. Maybe I m just a garbage writer. ",

      "text": "This is a good time to discuss with your advisor which arguments appear to be most suitable. \n\nMost unprocesses foods (e.g. whole plants), contain myriad bioactive compounds. Many of those get studied in isolation, and some of those get touted as the essential component of a superfood. That is almost always bunk. So far, nobody has really improved on the recommendation to eat a varied diet. (It might help focus your writing if you  think of that as your basline, rather than a diet without this particular food source.)",

          "text": "That's exactly my point! The sensoty studies that use the food for.as a partial replacer doesnt go over why it does certain things in food (texture, lipid oxidation, etc etc), and it's not possible or reasonable for me to guess why XYZ might be cause by ABC...hope that makes sense.",
