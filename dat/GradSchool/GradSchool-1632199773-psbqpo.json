I had my first ever meeting with my supervisor today and my computer was lagging BIG-TIME.\n\nI tried sharing my screen, and the screen lagged on that part showing the \"Quick Access\" of my files.\n\nI regularly take photos of my back topless to CHECK MY SCOLIOSIS, AND I THINK HE SAW A THUMBNAIL OF IT. (just upper half of body)\n\nI WANNA die :<<<\n\nSorry if this is not academic-related. The meeting went really well, but I just noticed this now.\n\nPlease tell me it's going to be okay HUHU. I am an embarrassing human being.\n\nI flaired this under \"FUN\" BUT THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL.\n\nI want to disappear",

      "text": " It's just your back, and it's a medical picture. It's no biggie. Porn has a very different vibe. I once walked up on a student, in the office, looking at big anime boobs. That was uncomfortable. But still, he just x-ed out of the window immediately and we never spoke of it. When this kind of thing can become really serious is when you're the one in a position of power, or you're working with relatively young students. There was a prof a while back whose \"busty college girl gets f...\" bookmark showed up on a screenshare and he got let go, but that was at least in part because it made the college kids he was teaching feel potentially fetishized.",

      "text": "His blog is no longer up, but there was a funny story a prof posted a few years ago. While teaching organic chem very early in his faculty career, he'd forgotten to mute messages one day. He got a message from his wife with an inappropriate joke (something along the lines of \"does no meat Fridays mean I can't get the D\") and it popped up in front of the entire class.\n\nAll that to say, it happens to profs too. Don't worry! Assuming he noticed at all, he probably doesn't think anything of it, or is thinking of close calls he himself has had.",

      "text": "Just to clarify - it was just your back pictured? I don't think that's really inappropriate or an issue but if you're concerned about it, that's definitely something worth sharing. Just a \"hey, I think you probably saw a photo of my back on my screen - if you've been curious about why I would have that, it's to check on my scoliosis progression (prognosis? Other word entirely?). Things are going well!\"\n\nOr, if scoliosis might ever be a problem that would require accommodations of any sort, you could head that off now. \"I just want to let you know that I have scoliosis. So far, I've been doing well with my PT for it - in fact, that's why I had a photo of my back on screen briefly at our last meeting, if you happen to remember that - and at this point I don't expect it to be an issue, but I did want to go ahead and let you know now in case I have a flare up (or whatever) later. Cheers!\"\n\nI prefer the second one because it addresses the issue without being totally *about* it but certainly you do you! And again, you don't have to address this if you don't want to! I don't think it's as big a deal as you're concerned about.",

I also get embarrassed when people see them but at least I am putting in the work to care for myself. Usually there is nothing sexy or inappropriate about them given the context. Reorganize your files so they are hidden better and move on. Most people have illegal porn on their PCs. Some people have no shame and have hentai backgrounds on their desktop. Your\u2019s is self medical monitoring. Hardly an issue. They didn\u2019t care and I am sure the lag was on your end.",
