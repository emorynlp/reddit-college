  "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI've found myself in a situation where I need to take a gap year, and I don't really know what I should be doing.\n\nEssentially I am in a one year MA program in the UK that runs until the end of September, and I won't get my results back until November of next year. While I like my program, it makes it essentially impossible to go directly into a Ph.D. program.\n\nSo I am wondering what I should do with myself after I finish my MA while I apply for Ph.D. programs and for the rest of the year. I would love to hear what other people have done, and any advice people may have!",

If you can do a job that is related to your MA even better, but just get a job that makes it easy for you to explore that place.",
