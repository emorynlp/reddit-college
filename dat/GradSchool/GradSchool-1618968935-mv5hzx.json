  "text": "Along with being in a pandemic, this is huge time in social and economic change. In America the Chauvin sentencing occurred and this may lead to a huge amount of change with how policing works.   \n\n\nA lot of things are happening, and I know the common advice is detach from it all, but that doesn't feel right either. A lot of people's lives are being affected, and it doesn't just sit right with me tuning myself completely out. \n\nHow do you keep up with both doing your work while also just paying attention to everything going on too?",

You don't need to follow _all the time_.\n\n- Stop browsing news websites, if you have them in your RSS feeds, remove them.\n\n- In general avoid people/publishers that publish _a lot_, news or not. It's never healthy.\n\n- Turn off the TV. Sell it on craigslist or something.\n\n- Use outlets that publish infrequently, like once a week. Inform yourself and be done with it. Anything urgent will inevitably find its way to you anyways.\n\n- Digital wellbeing apps may help.\n\n- In the end you can't just ignore stuff that directly affect your lives. Don't shame or blame yourself for that. And don't shame nor blame yourself for what you can't help change.",

Talk to loved ones - family, friends. Play online games with them, spend your time in these activities. As far as economic/political activities are concerned - if you cannot control it - don't think over it. Appreciate yourself. Be proud of yourself for simply waking up each day.",

I am constantly struggling to get good work done. You're not alone, but there's also no easy answer or exportable solution I've found.

We've had a migration crisis for the better part of a decade in North America and Europe; mass killings happen with shocking regularity; poverty, death and destruction have always been out there. What is different is the level of accessibility and coverage. Whereas things were previously filtered through a few major media organizations with large budgets and staff, now anybody with a decent Internet connection and a cellphone can generate their own content (for better or for worse). So it is ubiquitous.\n\nFor me, I strictly limit my media consumption to set times of the evening. Otherwise, I stay off of Facebook (for reasons other than \"news\" besides) and my Reddit feed doesn't have any news-y subs on it. The other piece is \"what can I do about this?\" I can't do anything personally about migrants at the border, I can't affect the outcome of the Chauvin trial. But what I can do is continue my work. Maybe it's easier for me because a lot of contemporary social issues are tied in with this, but setting limits is definitely important.",

Doom scrolling through the news doesn\u2019t really help anyone. Once you\u2019ve seen enough news (or Twitter feeds or whatever) to know what the issues are, use that to *do something*. This is a win-win: *you* will feel better, less guilty, you will have some sense of control or impact on these big overwhelming issues. And your community will benefit as well, because you will be taking on a (small) part of the important work that needs to be done.\n\nAt the same time, I assume you don\u2019t want to quit school to be a full time activist. So be really honest with yourself- what\u2019s most important to you? What feels right and in line with your values for balancing school and important social issues? Then you can be very clear about how much time and energy you want to devote to each. \n\nThis is what I do and I just think it\u2019s really the best way. You clearly care, which is good. Pretty much any human who truly understands what\u2019s going on must care. But maybe you don\u2019t see that there\u2019s things *you* can do that can actually have an impact. Your actions can make a change. Like no, you individually are not going to end racist policing. But you could be a small (but essential) part of making change across the country... any protest of millions of people is made up of a bunch of \u201cjust one person\u201ds. You could also be a really big part in making small or hyper-local change. \n\nSo yes, I care. But for me, it\u2019s not a distraction. For the most part these thoughts don\u2019t hurt me or truly \u201cdistract\u201d me, even though I truly do care. I think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been able to move my worries into real action. I\u2019ve used these thoughts/feelings to re-evaluate my priorities. And I know that I\u2019m (for the most part) acting in line with my values and priorities. That\u2019s because I do spend time working with others to make change. For me it makes it easy to focus on my work when I need to do that, because I know I will also spend time focusing on social issues, particularly in productive ways, and I feel like I\u2019m doing enough. \n\nTLDR: **Don\u2019t detach!** Lean into your feelings and concerns. Really listen to them and allow them to inform your actions. Funnel your social issues focus into something that is productive for you and your community. \n\nAnyways that ended up long but that\u2019s my advice! Overall this is a very good question snd it definitely makes me feel less alone in some ways to know others also care and struggle with these things.",

I\u2019ve tried to limit my social media consumption as much as possible. \n\nAs for news consumption, I highly recommend following the advice I got from Pantsuit Politics: pick two or three *reputable* websites/podcasts/sources to consume news from and that\u2019s it. (I also highly recommend Pantsuit Politics period, they do an awesome job at approaching subjects from a more calm and understanding mindset which has helped me process everything better). During election season, I found myself going down a rabbit hole of switching between NY times, cnn, msnbc, WaPo, axios, fivethirtyeight, and a few news podcasts for updates. It wasn\u2019t necessary, a lot of the info was repeated with slightly different opinion leanings, and it upset me a lot. I also recommend listening to \u201cThings Are Bad\u201d from Endless Thread, they interview a man from Sri Lanka who spent most of his young adulthood living through civil conflict there. His perspective helped me understand the weird balance of things going on as normal in my personal life and work while the country is seemingly melting down outside.",

For example, if I'm working on fabrication in the lab, it would probably take a declaration of war or a presidential resignation to change the rate at which I get that stuff done. Whereas if I'm working on theory stuff, I have to stay as far as possible from my phone, lest I be distracted by an anonymously-sourced Politico story claiming that Joe Manchin eats PB&J sandwiches with the peanut butter side down. A day like today is a pretty good one to try to stick to those undistractable tasks.\n\nI'm very bad at this, but I think it's a pretty good concept.",

I live in the Twin Cities and let me tell you **it was not easy.** \n\nThe pandemic was scary, but at the same time all businesses were closed like the bars. I do live not far from Chicago Avenue where GF was murdered.  I was so scared and it did delay opening of businesses which caused more concern. \n\nThe only thing I can say is you need to do what you have control of which is school and school is not easy either from a grad school perspective. Just do what you have control of, talk to someone, or stay busy so you can graduate and make you feel proud of yourself.",

My advisor hasn\u2019t necessarily been the most understanding either, so I hope you\u2019ve got a little more slack in terms of pressure for research productivity. It feels like I don\u2019t have the bandwidth for social issues, but I can\u2019t ignore them either.\n\nOne thing that I\u2019ve found somewhat fruitful was to engage with local activism to push for changes at my not-so-subtly-racist university. And I occasionally take a day to just let myself be consumed with the world\u2019s BS (today was one of those days) in the hope that I can reset and refocus tomorrow.",

But I don't regret it. I think I have learned much from this experience, if only life experience rather than academic experience, but that's ok. We are real human beings and not mindless research machines with no tethers in family and society.",

I haven't, and I'm just wondering if something like that could make a difference. There are a lot of days that I can't physically make it into the lab or think straight enough to make productive research plans...my research has fallen behind, but bringing this up with my advisor feels like making excuses. I want to be able to work more, but idk how with my garbage health :(",

So honestly I kind of gave up and resigned myself to do what I can because, like you said, it feels like bringing it up again and again comes off as an excuse. It's tough because academic culture is so unforgiving and we feel this constant pressure to keep up at the expense of our health :/ and at my university everyone assumes grad students are all young, healthy, and willing to fall on swords to do research, which is totally not the case... have you had any luck getting accommodations from your advisor or university? Wishing you the best regardless! You're all the stronger for making it this far :)",
