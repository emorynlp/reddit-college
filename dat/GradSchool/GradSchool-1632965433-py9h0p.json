  "title:": "Should I apply to grad school if I'm not 100% sure what my goals are?",
  "text": "I always thought about getting a master's in computer science, but I'm not really sure if it's worth the cost. I am going to graduate with a bachelor's in CS soon, so I could just get a software engineering job right out of undergrad and do the opposite of getting thousands of dollars into academic debt. \n\nI wanted the CS master's to learn about AI, but I'm also considering studying statistics because it's vaguely interesting. I don't know if I would personally benefit from a job in those fields more than a regular software job though, in which case I would be wasting my time and money. This is because I'm not SUPER passionate about anything; half of me wants to learn more and contribute to interesting projects, and the other half of me wants to just make money and spend more time on hobbies. \n\nApplication season is coming up, so I'm not sure if I should bother to apply to grad schools. I keep pulling my hair out flipping back and forth between my options, so would greatly appreciate any advice on what I should do/not do.",

      "text": "There are two reasons to go to grad school\n\nYou love the subject matter and want to learn more.\n\nThe master's degree is important for your career goals.\n\nIt doesn't seem like either one of those qualify for you yet because you're not sure what you want.\n\nSo there's no rush. Work a couple of years and find your direction or passion.",

      "text": "There are a couple of sites that offer at your own pace certificates/courses you can take. Maybe get a job and work for a bit and take a few of these courses to see if you really do want to get into AI/stats/etc. and then go from there. Save some money while working for a few years and maybe be able to foot the bill and come out with an MS and little to no debt. Good luck!",

It also depends on your goals as well. Masters is what you make of it tbh.",

      "text": "Put the effort you would have put into grad school apps into finding a job in the field. . .or any job you're interested in and peruse that for a year or two. Live on your own and see what life would be like in these fields. I made the mistake of rushing into grad school on a whim because I thought it was what I \"should do.\" I'm trying to correct my mistake now but it's hard. No matter who says what you have plenty of time before you need to go to grad school. When you're 45 looking back on life you might have a master's degree anyway but got to have a better understanding of why you're perusing it/figured out what your goals were if you took time to work and grow. But it's all up to you! Be honest with yourself and don't let anyone else influence what you really want BUT you. Own your life, and be proud of the choices you make! And as a CS major, man there will be plenty of work opportunities for you, mostly anywhere in the country. Doors are wide open.",
