  "text": "The question is: is it a good idea to get another funding source and ditch TAship?\n\nBackground:\nI am an international Ph.D. student in the United States with TAship that covers tuition and stipend.\n\nRecently, I was encouraged to apply to fellowships by a professor in my class. Also, my research on the internet told me that there are scholarships in my country that can fund my education. \n\nThe professor said, \u201cyou don't have to be a TA anymore,\u201d and that sounded good to me.\n\nHowever, it seems like having a teaching experience boosts my chance of securing a position after I get a degree, especially if you want to stay in academia.\n\nMy eventual goal(industry/academia) is not clear yet(one sure thing is that I want to be a researcher in my field), so I want to know if ditching a TAship can burn some bridges.\n\nAny advice?",

Assuming you can keep your grades up and do well with your research, the teaching experience will be useful for applying for jobs at schools where research is not a priority. They'll like to see you've taught a few different classes in your field, if you can get the opportunity.",

If you skip a year of TAing harder to get back on and even more so if you don\u2019t do it fall then try for spring. \n\nI\u2019d say it could hurt you if you wanted to be in academia because you lose out on hours and experience that goes along with teaching",
