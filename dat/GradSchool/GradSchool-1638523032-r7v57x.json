I got my masters at an Austrian university (I\u2019m originally from the US) from what I can understand they just want proof that your undergrad degree is valid. \n\nI remember I just gave them a copy of my diploma + official transcripts during my application (this might be enough depending on where your undergrad is from, unfortunately Austrian bureaucracy gives some people an easier time and others a harder time based on their nationality :/) \n\nI would recommend emailing the admit office for clarification :)",

Are they wanting a proof from my undergrad university or the university in my home country which offers the same program as the Austrian university ?\n\nYes, if you are from US, it\u2019s a bit easier. \n\nThank you. I\u2019ve already emailed them but they just sent that link back \ud83e\udd74",

              "text": "It doesn't seem to be required for it to be your undergraduate institution. It seems that you simply have to find an accredited university in your country that offers the same degree program, and then somehow get a confirmation from this university that you would be allowed to enroll in their program. It does not seem to have anything to do with your undergraduate degree though.",

      "text": "Maybe that clarifies it a bit:\n\nFor applying to a bachelors-degree you must have a Matura(or something comparable like the german Abitur, french Baccalaur\u00e9at, british A-Levels). These entitle you to study anything. If your country has something similar, but is outside the EEA, some accredited university in your country must confirm that you would be eligible to study the same programme at that particular university.\n\nSay you want to study computer science at the JKU and you are american, an american university that offers computer science(say MIT) must confirm that you would be qualified enough to study computer science at their campus(in other words the MIT(or similar) would need to confirm that you fullfill all requirements to study computer science at the MIT(or similar) for you to be able to study cs in austria).\n\nAs I understand, this is more or less the same with the masters degree. You must find a university to confirm you are eligible to study that particular programme(you want to study in austria) with them.",
