  "title:": "I'm gonna quit and I'm excited but also terrified",
  "text": "I started my program and it became quickly apparent that I had a strong dislike for the work and the project I was doing. I decided very early on that I didn't want to be a career scientist, and that nothing about this degree seemed like it was worth the time. \n\nThen, the pandemic hits. Productivity hits an all-time low, and I genuinely stop caring about my project, causing my PI to stress to no end. I thought to myself, \"OK. When the lockdowns end, I'll go back to the city and try one more time to see if I can get back into lab work. Then I'll make a decision.\" And guess what? I hate it even more now. I just can't see the point in this. So I'm going to quit. Have a couple interviews lined up back home. \n\nSo where am I going from here? Well, medical school is something I've always been passionate about pursuing, but something that also initially scared me off when I finished my undergrad - which is what caused me to go into grad school. Now that I have 100% confirmed what I want my path to be, and I know what it will take to get there, I feel confident about leaving this program and pursuing what I really want. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, rant over. Thanks for listening.",

Now I\u2019m getting a terminal post masters degree in the same field. It\u2019s a journey sometimes to find out what you really want. I did go into some debt for it, But I\u2019m still glad I learned so much about myself and found something I\u2019m passionate about instead of sticking with something for the sake of consistency when I wasn\u2019t happy. Congrats and best wishes on your new journey!",

Turns out I just don't like working on one thing for too long. Lots of short, always changing projects is what I like...not focusing on one thing for 5 years. \n\nNot trying to cast doubt on what you've decided, but don't jump out of the frying pan and into the fire unless you know that being a physician is going to make you happy.",

I was in a fairly new discounted cyber security masters program that was $250/credit. but to switch to the psychology program I wanted, I would be $675/credit so I looked elsewhere for something cheaper. by the end of the day, I had researched 30+ schools and ended up submitting applications to 6. I talked to a bunch of admissions counselors, submitted transcripts, all within a day and a half. I had one school in mind that I really wanted and it just so happened they called this morning to tell me I had been accepted. I registered for classes this morning and I start my new school on August 31st. Called my old school to let them know I wouldn\u2019t be attending in the Fall, moved some plans around and now I am in a MAPsy program.",
