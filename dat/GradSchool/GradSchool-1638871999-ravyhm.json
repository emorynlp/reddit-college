  "title:": "dumb question, but can i apply to a phd program when my current research experience is in a related but kinda different field",
  "text": "i want to pursue a phd in pharmacology or at least do my research project involved in drug discovery. i\u2019m currently a research assistant taking a gap year or two to build up my research experience. i did my undergrad in biochemistry and i took a bunch of upper level chemistry courses as electives. i do have some have experience in medicinal chemistry synthesis but the bulk of my research is in cellular metabolism & studying this particular protein involved in cellular metabolism. we do have some drug discovery involved in a current project im involved in, but it\u2019s not like the main point of the project. do you think i still have a fair shot into getting into a pharmacology phd program?",

      "text": "Generally, yes you can. I can\u2019t say for pharmacology in particular, but most admissions committees are primarily interested in finding students that *would* be good researchers/students if they joined the program. Maybe reach out to current pharmacology students and see what it\u2019s like in your field",
