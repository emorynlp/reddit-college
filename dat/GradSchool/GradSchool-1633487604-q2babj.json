      "text": "Pretty sure Zotero has the option to not include a physical file. What I do is copy the DOI number from a paper I want, enter it into Zotero, and it will pull the info from there. I have it set to automatically download the pdf if it\u2019s available (pretty sure you can turn that off), but if there\u2019s no pdf it opens the paper in your browser. Maybe you should look into that.",
