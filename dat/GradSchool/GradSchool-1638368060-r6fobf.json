  "text": "I am finishing my master's degree in Mechanical engineering where I've been studying the cardiovascular system. It's research that I've really grown to enjoy. I am planning on pursuing a PhD doing the same research, but I've grown unhappy with my advisor and have considered other options.\n\nI know the math department does similar research, as does Biomedical engineering. To be honest, I want all three, but I feel I need to focus on one approach. I really don't know who I can talk to about it. My advisor would surely freak out for even bringing it up.\n\nObviously, there are differences in how each department approaches their work. Would one direction prevent me from working with/for another?",

It is my understanding its fairly normal to switch schools after completing a degree",

      "text": "Are you really committed to staying in your current school, or are you also thinking about other institutions you might apply to? The upside to (most) PhD programs is that there's more flexibility to work with folks from other depts that have overlap with your work \\[my committee is actually 50%-50% with folks from other depts and I think my dissertation will ultimately be much stronger for it\\]. I think it would be worth identifying a couple programs and future advisors that you might like to work with, and have a conversation about how flexible the program is with committee structure. \n\nAs someone else already mentioned, making up the pre-reqs and going through the coursework of an entire math PhD might be a lot, but there might be a cool math/stats/etc professor who would be wiling to serve on your committee and help turn you on to future opportunities, etc. Some degree programs may not allow as much flexibility, so it's worth spending time doing research and having those conversations with future advisors now. \n\nAnd if you are really committed to staying in your current school, just stay super polite with your current advisor when you let them know your plans (you can say something like \"I really appreciate your advice and supervision thus far. The current trajectory of my research has shifted throughout this process, and I believe X program/Y potential supervisor is better aligned with my vision for my future work\"). I think most professors will let it go, even if they don't agree with you. If you're really worried about retaliation or something, try to keep a paper trail of your interactions in case you need to elevate an issue to your school ombudsman, or maybe don't let them know your decision until after they've approved your thesis.",

My advisor had been open to it, my only real issue is that I do a lot of work in our lab, which I feel isn't appreciated.  Also, I've done my undergrad and master's in the same program. I wouldn't mind a change.",

      "text": "The prerequisites for admission to a math grad program are courses most engineers haven't taken voluntarily such as real and complex analysis, so that might eliminate this option if you haven't taken enough coursework. Is the department large enough that you could find another advisor with what you're interested in? A PhD in mechanical eng where the research is focused in bio will open a lot more doors than a PhD in biomedical engineering even if the coursework and research is similar because the title implies a more general skill set. I went from a biomedical engineering undergrad to a math masters because there just weren't any jobs I was interested in and other industries prefer hiring mechanical engineers over biomedical.",
