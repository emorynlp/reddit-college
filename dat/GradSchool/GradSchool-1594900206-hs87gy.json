      "text": "I went from having a MS advisor that gave compliments maybe once or twice a year. Exceedingly rare. And they meant a lot, but I also decided to find a different lab for my PhD because I just didn\u2019t feel supported. \n\nMy current advisor is far more complimentary and encouraging, to the point I sometimes struggle to internalize things and actually accept that things are going well. I think having self confidence and accepting compliments is definitely a struggle when you are inside your project and know what still isn\u2019t working right and what hasn\u2019t played out like you expected. That\u2019s why you need to trust outside sources like your advisor. If they say things are going well, they\u2019re going well!",
