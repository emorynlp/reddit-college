  "text": "Update and OP below. \n\nOP: https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/qm045h/depression_and_burn_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAfter visiting the counseling center today, and talking with some previous mentors and advisors of mine, I\u2019ve decided to take a leave of absence. \n\nCurrently, I have no desire to be in the environment that I am in. I know I can do better, and I want that for myself. I hope to use this time to 1) work on my mental health and 2) figure out if this program is something I want to return to. \n\nMy plan is to finish this semester, which is a bit daunting at times, but I feel okay knowing that the end is near. Thanksgiving break is in ~2 weeks, and then ~3 weeks after that is the end of the semester. \n\nMy previous boss that i worked under prior to leaving is offering me a position to go back and join the team again, at a higher position than I was at before (she is a true gem). I\u2019ll start that in the beginning of the new year, since I still really need a winter break. \n\nI have a lease in my current city that runs until late spring, so my boss is allowing me to work remotely until then. Once my lease is up in the spring of 2022, I plan on moving back to where I was prior to the program where all my social support is located! \n\nI still need to talk to my PI, so all and any advice is appreciated\u2026.I feel so incredibly relieved already. Like a weight has been lifted.",

      "text": "This sounds like a really good plan. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re taking care of yourself. It\u2019s amazing that you already have a job lined up. I mean, way to go, you. \n\nWhat you say to your PI depends on how comfortable you feel opening up to them. You can say you\u2019re having some health issues and you need to take a leave of absence while you work through them. You can mention mental health if you feel like it. Honesty is nice if you feel like you have that sort of relationship with your advisor, but they\u2019re not necessarily entitled to your personal information if you don\u2019t feel like sharing. Hopefully they\u2019ll be supportive. \n\nHas the counseling center set you up with who you need to talk to to work all the logistics out? Do you need documentation with the disability office? Also, in the future, don\u2019t be afraid to seek reasonable accommodations. As you work on your mental health now, keep in mind what you need to succeed. \n\nYou said you feel relieved, but I hope you feel proud of yourself, too. You realized what you need and you followed through. Wishing you the best moving forward.",

So I plan to do that on Monday, during our weekly meeting. I\u2019m not sure what the next steps are, and it\u2019s not very clear on the department website\u2026stay tuned I suppose!",

Congrats on taking care of yourself!!\n\n I read OP, I\u2019m similar age and situation as you (23F, moved across the country to a place I\u2019d never visited and knew no one to start my PhD). I truly think having roommates has kept me *somewhat* sane. When you come back, maybe consider living with others! Roommates aren\u2019t for everyone (and I think I got really lucky) but having two other grad students who know the struggle has been such a support.\n\nYou got this!",
