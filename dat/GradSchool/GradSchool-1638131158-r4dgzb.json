  "text": "Yep, 2 weeks left. Finals, term projects, final assignments all coming due. Yet, I have a doctoral candidate for 2 classes who has graded NOTHING all semester, including our midterm we took 8 weeks ago. The Dropbox for an assignment due Thursday isn\u2019t even open!?! 2 projects in another class with her we\u2019ve been told we will get an outline and/or rubric for the last 3 weeks and still nothing! Obviously I\u2019ll be putting it on the instructor review, but damn this is ridiculou.\n\nEND OF RANT",
