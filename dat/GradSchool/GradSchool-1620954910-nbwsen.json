  "text": "I apologize if this isn't allowed but I wanted to share with people who might understand.\n\nAs a habitual procrastinator, I have been submitting things late my whole life. But since February this year I have met every deadline I set for myself/with my advisor. I have actually followed through on every date and submission, and now my thesis is in ON TIME- this is even when my advisor has not responded to anything at all on time. I'm super proud of myself, especially because as of January I wasn't sure I was going to make it through or graduate at all. \n\nOh, AND my advisor loved what I wrote. That's also a big deal because in December she told me she didn't see this coming together. \n\nYAY!",
