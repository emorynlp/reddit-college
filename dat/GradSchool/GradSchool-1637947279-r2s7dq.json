  "title:": "Master's thesis defense in two weeks and I am losing my sleep",
  "text": "I am doing a joint masters between two universities in Europe. The first university I have already graduated and got my diploma. However, the second university asked me to come in person to defend my thesis because an online defense is not online and therefore I am flying to there one day before the thesis defense. I have argued alot about this with the supervisor there and he wouldn't understand. He also mentioned that they will do their best to make a fool out of me. I wake up in the middle of the night scared to not be able to answer a basic question during the defense. Any tips would be really appreciated. I posted something similar once, but I need a second time vent.",
