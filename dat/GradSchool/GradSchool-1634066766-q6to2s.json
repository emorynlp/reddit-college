  "text": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m a STEM PhD in my second year and I got an offer to attend a big online conference for free. I\u2019m not presenting, just attending, but I want to make the most of my time from this. There\u2019s going to be quite a few networking breaks, but is there going to be much of a way for me to network if I\u2019m not presenting anything? My advisor is sick and hasn\u2019t been available for a while, so I can\u2019t go to her for advice right now. \n\nI guess my main question is what should I be doing during this conference? \ud83d\ude02",

      "text": "If it is online certainly take time to answer the interactive polls, play games and if speed networking is a thing come up with a 30 second intro.  Seek someone out to chat with.  Read who\u2019s going to be there, and make it a point to chat them up.  Ask them for 5 minutes to talk about X. \nMy final bit of advice for ALL conferences, not just online conferences, come up with a good question for presenters.  That way you get to introduce yourself to the whole group and ask the thing that everyone would like answered.",

I received this invite two days ago and the conference is tomorrow morning. They had already planned the whole thing with the presentations and networking breaks. Should I have a presentation prepared in case I get the opportunity to present?",
