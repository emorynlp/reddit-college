  "title:": "How the fuck do universities not realize that their grad students are people with, y'know, bills?",
  "text": "I'm going into my fifth year of the program, and this is a constant problem. There is a stipend, and that's great! But it means I have to work part time to make everything work instead of full time. Constantly though the professors and university somehow don't realize that bills are a thing. I had a prof for my orals that was HORRIFIED by my working the summer before them. I didn't know what to say but I wish I could have pointed out that unless he wants to pay my bills, yeah of course I'm working! Do they just not get that the stipends that stay the same for decades don't pay the way anymore? I'm not in a super expensive location thankfully but its still a major city.\n\nOr today, I met with one of my advisors because I'm going to be TAing a class next semester. Only problem is, my part-time gig is teaching a few classes at a local private school. Morning was going to be set aside for TAing and working on my thesis, afternoons for supplementing the stipend. But apparently they changed the time of the class I was going to TA and didn't even think it was necessary to inform the TAs about the change, certainly not asking us if it was possible for us. This is the last requirement except for my thesis, so I need to TA a course. But I also need to be able to actually have some sort of income beyond the paltry stipend (the extra stipend for TAing is something but also not much).\n\nI suppose this ties into the general disregard for life to be affordable based on work, and its a pain. They think they can just throw us around for jack shit and its just not ok. If they want to run my life, pay me enough! In the meantime, I'll chug along with my research and my part-time work so I can live a decent life. That doesn't seem like so much to ask.",

One was ONLY $10 an hour and the other $12 AND BETWEEN THE TWO I COULD ONLY WORK 40 hours (10 hours per role each week) for a pay period (if approved).

I asked for a raise and obviously didn\u2019t get it and my advisor was not HAPPY with me working at all!  I found my full time job and it pays me nicely and my advisor was trying to talk me out of it and not take 2 classes (online). My advisor was so against me working and it was weird cause I work full time in higher Ed my program is an online education master\u2019s and I received MEGA push back!

Graduate students are cheap labor, we are desperate for the limited educational/scientific resources available, and are locked into very precarious funding situations which make us effectively captive labor for the length of a PhD. Graduate school historically, or any upper education, has been reserved for the upper classes of the socioeconomic ladder and only recently has that begun shifting in a meaningful way. The institutional and cultural mindset however, still has this view in my opinion, and many professors and admin are mostly either well meaning but elitist liberals at best or vile, social darwinist, technofacists at worst. When the institutional answer to \"my grad students cannot afford to eat\" is \"have faculty donate to a food bank\" rather than \"pay your TA/RAs a living wage\" then that's some Victorian era nonsense placing the blame/responsibility at the individual level. You'd think folks with Dr. next to their name would understand how systems theory works but I digress. \n\nUniversity administrators have enabled and created systems which punish or put undue hardship on the poor (no moonlighting, no startups/IP, fuck you if you don't like wages/terms) while allowing the wealthy and connected to just breeze on through. They designed these institutions to be harder to access if you're poor/black/woman, and then trot you out like a fucking token when you manage to succeed against their stacked deck.",

They provide some compensation for research students do for the university but ultimately they are hoping to make money off the student. \n\n I think also there is this expectation that college students, particularly those in graduate school are from middle to upper class and more privileged backgrounds that is in juxtaposition with the reality that more people from lower class and underprivileged backgrounds have been going to college and that they don't  have family paying their way through school. This can be seen when debates over student loans come up with many people suggesting that if you need to take out loans you shouldn't go to school, or that certain majors  that historically make less over one's career should only be available to people who can fully fund their own education. I think also many professors and administrators are unaware or turn a blind eye to the real problems of student poverty that occur.",

They figure that if you were truly in bad straits then your family could shell out a bit of money to help you. They don\u2019t really comprehend the finality of homelessness and starvation and bankruptcy because they assume someone in your life could step in and help you avoid those. They assume that if you failed out, you\u2019d have a family home you could stay in with family who could feed you, at least temporarily.\n\nThey\u2019re also people who might get assistance from their family if their pay is a bit low. It might only be $10 or $50 a week, but when that\u2019s the difference between meeting bills and not, it\u2019s a huge amount.\n\nAlso, grad school poverty is pretty different to actual poverty. We use the former way too much to describe ourselves when many of us don\u2019t fall into poverty, we\u2019re just poor. We shouldn\u2019t try to minimise that term by applying it to all grads.

One of the most prominent ways is socioeconomic status.\n\nAll of my friends who had families or grew up knowing the struggles of poverty all went into trades (and made more than a postdoc within 2-3 years of finishing high school) or into the work force immediately after college. There is no benefit for them to go further into debt with a master's, or be paid trash for 5 years with a PhD + average with a postdoc. \n\nIn this sense, most from disadvantaged backgrounds don't see it advantageous to go into higher education. Especially if you have a family you need to support. \n\nAdditionally, scholarships and positions tend to go towards those who've had the most resources (and so better grades, more papers, prestigious universities, coaching on applications, etc.) and so are better candidates. \n\nIt's just a circle jerk of academics. Again, I'll probably get downvoted, and I know there are exceptions, but academia really is self-selecting in a way most don't see. Higher education will never get the diversity it wants unless major changes are made.",

Academia selects for a certain kind of person and while that person now at least is allowed to look different, they still must fit the mold. And the only way to fix this is a ground up rebuild of the system and that not happening any time soon. But I can not reconcile going to grad school at one of the best public universities in the country when 20min down the road there are high schools that don't have science teachers.

Naturally, many people from several departments were angry about the change. We don't have a formal union but we're able to pen a letter to the administration which represented several departments (and a huge chunk of grad students) describing our disagreements.\n\nAround that time, there was a protest (undergrads protesting tuition increases). And a few of the professors even assured my cohort they would support any form of protest, even a strike. Given that people in my department are very close, it seemed that it would've been easy enough to mobilise a strike. Honestly, I wasn't that worried (where would the university find TAs for most major science departments on such short notice?).\n\nLuckily we didn't have to go there (the protests by undergrads gained enough attention from local news media) and they backtracked from the more unpopular portions of the budget.",

Frankly I\u2019m shocked unionization isn\u2019t as widespread as I thought it was at other schools.\n\nI am 100% pro-Union personally, they just also don\u2019t seem to be accomplishing much with our wages as stagnant as they are. Mostly due to school actions snd the setbacks federally a couple years ago. I get no benefits and make about 14k. That\u2019s the same as it\u2019s been for over a decade. I\u2019m in the Union. They just don\u2019t have much power to get us a living wage. More action needs to happen. I\u2019m not in the social sciences and not an expert in unions. I\u2019m only speaking from my experience as a GA in a grad union. But also look at Columbia recently-the bargaining wasn\u2019t approved by many students. \n\nhttps://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED587798.pdf\n\nhttps://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/05/01/colu-m01.html\n\nETA: NLRB to withdraw proposed Trump rule. 57,500 currently unionized per this.\n\nhttps://truthout.org/articles/biden-labor-board-strikes-barrier-to-unionization-of-1-5-million-grad-students/\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that graduate students often teach classes, assist in research, attend conferences, lead field trips and hold office hours, they can make as little as $20,000 a year. It\u2019s tremendously difficult for students to fight for higher wages or expanded benefits because most aren\u2019t even considered workers by their employers.\u201d\n\nFreaking ouch. Nice to find out how low my salary is comparatively. Less than half national average. The highest I was offered for where I\u2019m going for my PhD is 24k. And I\u2019m in stem (NASA research, even).",

It feels like achieving a union should immediately confer benefits because it takes so much effort to overcome the obstacles to unionization, but the union still has to actually consolidate and wield power. There are tons of obstacles to overcome. \"But is it really worth all this time and effort?\" is exactly what the union's opponents want people to think. They want to run out the clock and discourage people. We shouldn't fight that by lying and saying everything will be easy or quick. We shouldn't lie by omission either. But we should be careful about how we communicate because it's easy to accidentally say things that play into their hands.\n\nAlso, from one NASA grad student to another, howdy! And good luck with your research. :)",

But I do think it borders on a false dichotomy: I think grad students do gain valuable teaching and research experience to pad their own CVs, under the caveat that they provide relatively cheap labor and contribute to the prestige of their supervisors. Sure, grad schools disproportionately advertise the former over the latter, but any successful recruitment campaign would do so, and I don't think it's terribly different from how industry jobs advertise their own roles (e.g. in tech, you're more likely to see \"work on a world-class team developing cutting-edge products for millions of customers!\" rather than \"spend 40+ hours a week doing repetitive coding tasks so that the execs double their bonuses!\").\n\nThe \"career prospects\" point is interesting, though. On the one hand, in my experience (admittedly anecdotal), I went into grad school under the impression that a career in academia was the exception rather than the norm, sort of like how college athletes know that their chances of eventually making it to a professional league are quite slim. Even my MS adviser essentially confirmed this to me. However, I am also in STEM where graduate degrees also carry a lot of clout in industry, so I am likely biased to some extent in this regard. I can see how this would be a different situation in the humanities, for example, and how there is probably much more deception about career prospects to try to convince so many grad students that their time and money is worth it.",

Unfortunately this isn't an ideal world, and money is a factor which constrains our career and lifestyle choices. I agree that it is unfortunate how big of a barrier income is to attaining education (I was actually a first-generation student myself, so I am quite familiar with this barrier, despite being able to go to grad school myself). And I definitely agree that universities should allow their grad students to obtain supplemental income if necessary. But my point is that universities are not *ipso facto* scammers that employ grad students as \"victims\" when these grad students are (or should be) well aware of the situation they are entering and making the decision as well-informed adults to join the program themselves.",

Coursework would be seminar discussions on the week's readings with a paper due someone near the end of the course of at least 15 pages in length. The paper would probably need at least a dozen sources--the more of them being primary sources the better. How much time did you friend spend reading? For historians reading is part of the job and is work.\n\nThe number of comprehensive exams in history can vary depending on how the program is structured, but a history PhD student can anticipate having to thoroughly familiarize themselves with 30-40 books and how these works fit into the historiography of comprehending a time period (20th-century Europe), theme (colonialism) and dissertation topic (Gandhi's influence upon elite British opinion on the colonial question). \n\nEDIT: 20th-century Europe, British colonialism and Gandhi's influence upon British elites would each be their own separate exam. So there's 90-120 monographs right there.",

She had something happen in her personal life her first semester, and honestly, I'm not really sure she ever did the work she was supposed to do to finish the semester (she took Is). I remember her discussing comps but not actually taking them, so it's possible that that was also a factor. She started dating her now husband the summer between her two years and I know that really drove her desire for a 9-5 job.\n\nI won't lie, I was very suspicious of her time in grad school given what I knew at the time (she went right from undergrad, I waited a few years) and what I quickly learned when I started grad school. Your comments make me feel like I was right to be suspicious that it wasn't supposed to be as \"easy\" as she made it out to be.  \n\n\nETA: By \"easy\" I don't mean \"easy\" but the lack of responsibility until you were ABD.",
