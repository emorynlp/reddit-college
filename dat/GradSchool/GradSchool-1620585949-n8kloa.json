  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just turned in my final assignment as a doctoral candidate in psychology. I will be completing my APA internship this year and hopefully defending my dissertation before June. I hope this does not seem like a humblebrag, as that is **NOT** my intention with this post. \n\nNow for the hope for those who feel like they can't make it.\n\nFirst off, ***you can.*** I wanted to share that I am someone that struggled academically. I started off at community college, did very well but always had to work \"much harder\" than the other students. For example, if someone told me they were studying for 5 days before an exam, I knew I needed to study for at least a week or two. For my bachelor's degree, I did fairly well but still made the occasional B-/C+ in courses related to statistics and research methods, which killed any hope I had of being a researcher. I was able to get into a master's program, but it was grueling. I did not believe I would pass some of my classes but I still never gave up. I found new study techniques and emotional support to offset the exhaustion and fear of failure. My dream has always been to be a doctor of some sort, but I felt like I was not intelligent enough to make it. My master's GPA was 3.63, compared to my classmates who had 4.0's and were thriving. I still wanted to pursue a doctorate but I was terrified of rejection and confirming my greatest fear: I am stupid or an imposter. Nevertheless, I was encouraged by a faculty member to apply to a few programs, and to my shock, got interviews at great programs.\n\nFast forward to today, I passed my doctoral comp exams with honors, have published a paper and poster presentation, and landed my dream internship (I'm studying to become a clinical psychologist). I know it is difficult and this may seem like fluff to some, but for those who have felt like me, please just keep going. It is possible to make it when you don't think you can.",

You don't have to do a groundbreaking study, but do something you truly enjoy and that is manageable. \n\nI have heard nightmare stories of people waiting until a week or two before their internship ends to finish/defend their dissertation. If possible, avoid this! I also made a set schedule and met with my advisor two to three times a month. I'm in the data collection phase of my study right now and am planning to use June for analyzing and writing! \n\nI hope this helps!",

I was also told that if you didn't have a 3.0 GPA in undergrad, don't bother applying to graduate school. My heart goes out to the students who gave up on their dream career due to believing they really were not intelligent enough.\n\nAlso, a NCI grant is no small feat, so congratulations on that remarkable accomplishment!!\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89",

The vagus nerve is responsible for GI inflammation suppression. Without it your risk of colorectal cancer increases.

For some reason, handwriting my notes helped me retain the information better. Additionally, making one or two friends in your cohort will be a blessing. These will be your greatest study-buddies and ensure that you actually know the material. \n\nAdditionally, when it came to major exams, I used Quizlet religiously (at least a week out) and would use notecards. You can also try using the Pomodoro study techniqus. They helped when I needed to study a lot of information without burning out.\n\nMost importantly, ASK YOUR PROFESSORS FOR HELP AND WHAT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON. Sorry for the caps, but I've come to learn that a lot of professors are not trying to trick you and if you voice concern/ask a myriad of questions, they really appreciate it because you're showing that you actually care about the material. \n\nBonus tip: read out loud and then quietly a few times (the same material). This seems weird but it allowed me to retain more information. \n\nI hope these tips help!",
