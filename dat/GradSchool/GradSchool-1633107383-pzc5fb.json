That doesn't change the fact that they are all some of the most accomplished theoretical physicists of all time.\n\nThat's just the nature of creating a space exclusively populated with smart people: the baseline  for \"who the dumb one is\" is a lot higher than the general population, and it becomes very easy to feel behind the curve that way. This is why so many high achievers start to get impostor syndrome when they get to grad school if they didn't have it in high school or undergrad: they've finally entered a space where they aren't the default smartest person in the room anymore and feel stupid for the first time in their lives.\n\nI think its important to keep some perspective here and remember that you're in this space of grad school for a reason, especially if you're in a funded PhD. It takes a significant time and monetary investment to take on a grad student and they don't take that decision lightly. If you're here, it's because the department thought you were capable of succeeding there, and that should tell you enough about how smart you \\*really\\* are.\n\nOne thing I make a point of doing in grad school is socializing with people who are \\*not\\* in my cohort, faculty, or even other grad students. People I meet around town, through recreational activities, or friends of my boyfriend. Being able to interact with people outside the academia bubble can help sometimes to remind me just how smart I really am and just why exactly I am in grad school in the first place without just making me feel dumb all the time.",

At least with me, I was always told I was \"super smart\" and in high school/half of college could basically bang out an assignment the day/hour before it was due and get a perfectly good grade. Quite the shock to my system to learn how hard certain subjects actually are, and that I couldn't just start writing a massive project/presentation the night before and have it be any kind of passable.",

By giving students the \"you failed at this exam\" thing super early, the idea is it would give them that kick in the pants to say they need to develop real study habits as early as possible so that they are more likely to succeed when it matters.",

I can publish honest, but decidedly mediocre science in lower IF journals. I'll probably graduate with a thin thesis, my advisors like me as a person but they clearly see I'm not too bright so they'll get rid of me at some point, et cetera. I can contribute my niche knowledge from time to time and feel dumb the rest of the week. I am ok with it. I'm not an amazing academic, but grad school has given me so much beyond the academics that I do not regret it one bit. Sure I turned out to be seemingly incapable of grasping basic concepts despite years of trying to learn them, but on the other hand I know I'm good at maintaining the lab(s), servicing the instruments and organizing projects, and I know I should not pursue a career in academia. Is doing a PhD the best career decision I could have made? Probably not, but I still learned things, did stuff I'm really proud of and developed as a person, and it's not a bad time, overall. \n\nSo my outlook on this is that you're only an imposter if you do nothing and don't try to get anything out of your grad school experience. I tried, I'm just dumb lol. But that's okay. I'm surrounded by brilliant people who are very dedicated to their science and publish in top journals. I'm glad I had the honor of knowing them and working with them. When they become famous I can brag about keeping the glovebox running for them :P And that's enough for me!",
