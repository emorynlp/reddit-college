  "text": "I made a post about how I have only 3 classes a week and only spend 8 hours a week in class.  I couldn't imaging Grad School being hard.\n\nBut rn fuck.\n\nI know everyone said grad school is a full time job. But even at over 40 hours a week, I still feel like I have one and more work to do.\n\nEach class gives me a crazy amount of homework. \n\nI spend at least three days a week just doing homework. \n\nOn top of that, there's my studies so I am prepared for midterms when they happen.\n\nAnd then each class's pre class reading takes me an hour or so.\n\nIt feels like a recipe for burnout.\n\nFucking hell. This isn't fun.\n\nI don't know where to get free time from.\n\nMaybe I'm not smart enough for Grad school.  irdk",

It was manageable in my Master's program because I didn't have to TA, but in my PhD program when I took 9 hours in addition to teaching and research, I was exhausted. Especially so considering my classes all required a final paper, so at the end of the semester I'd be expected to produce between 60 and 90 pages of writing in term papers. After that, I stuck with two classes a semester and it was much more manageable because dropping one class meant between 150 and 200 pages less reading I'd have to do every week.",

Focus on the ones most relevant to you, and do enough to be good in the others. \n\nAlso, you\u2019ll learn to read differently. By the time I finished, pretty much none of us were reading everything for every class. We read the things we needed to for the classes where we needed to be great.

Like r/HalfEatenPie said, your time management skills get better and you'll complete assignments more efficiently. \n\nI approach classwork as an opportunity to get better at skills I already practice for my research (typically programming and writing) or to familiarize myself with a new topic. I work hard on the assignments that seem interesting, and less hard on the ones that aren't. I noticed that with each new semester, I get better at knowing how many hours are needed for certain types of assignments. I budget the time, start the clock, and work for those hours. And that's it; I don't devote any more priority time to the assignment. It works for me. \n\nTry hard. Done is much better than perfect. Research takes priority over classwork. If you do that, I think you're doing fine!",

This will probably happen naturally through grad school but it's far better to start deliberately focusing on this right away.  For example:\n\n* Read up on time and project management techniques.\n\n* Pay attention to when you're most efficient and when you're least.  Think about what tasks need to be done at what points in your mental state / focus cycle and schedule your days and weeks accordingly.  \n\n* Estimate how long tasks will take you and then, if you take way longer than expected, determine whether that's because your estimate was terrible or because you spent too much time moving too slowly on one part of the work.  Solve whichever problem it is.\n\n* Notice when you're working slowly or losing focus.  Take a break, and/or change how you're approaching your work.  Spending tons of time accomplishing nearly nothing is a very efficient path to burnout - it's better for your work and your health if you spend that time getting into a good mental state and work efficiently afterwards instead.",
