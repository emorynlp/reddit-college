  "text": "I got the email this morning while I was in the middle of researching. I closed my laptop and climbed back into bed. I'm allowing myself to be sad, I need to be sad. My cap and gown are hanging up in the closet. I worked so hard it all feels like its falling apart. I havent heard from my committee in two weeks, I know they are so incredibly stressed themselves with a transition to online, but I feel like I'm in the dark with writing and research. I'm supposed to defend in May, that'll be over a Skype call.\n\nI'm so sad. And scared. It felt like my life was falling into place perfectly and then boom, life got completely flipped upside down over night. \n\nI know I'm not the only grad student going through this, I guess that makes me feel a little less alone. But that email cut so deep. \n\nTo others who may get the same email this week, we're going to be okay. We'll make it through this sucky time and it'll be ok.",
