  "title:": "Debating between two Master's degrees: foreign language teaching or literature?",
  "text": "* **Personal information:** Literature undergrad, European, Spanish native, not living in Europe but in the country of my S.O.\n* **Want to work in the following fields:** Literature, linguistics.\n* **Want to work in (more specifically):** Literature teaching, language teaching AND translation. Maybe academia depending on what I stumble upon during my academic and professional life.\n* **Proficient in**: Spanish, English, French.\n* **Other future plans:** I want to study a second Master's degree in ''Asian literature'' (it's something quite specific and I would study it in the country's language).\n\nNow, for my first Master's, I'm contemplating these options:\n\n* **Spanish as a foreign language**\n\n1. Pros: I want to live in different countries for some time and this one could be more useful for this purpose. Slightly shorter that the second option.\n2. Cons: Not very useful if I live in a Spanish-speaking country.\n\n* **Literature** (I would probably choose comparative literature).\n\n1. Pros: More useful if I live in a Spanish-speaking country (which might be the case for the majority of my life, but that's uncertain).\n2. Cons: Teaching in different countries might be harder. Slightly longer than the former option.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n* **Literature + Spanish as a foreign language + ''Asian literature''** = My Master's degrees would not be very useful in South America, where almost all immigrants speak Spanish and the specific Asian literature I want to pursue is not taught anywhere. The second Master's degree is, nevertheless, related to the literature I want to translate and could be quite useful in Europe, where I could become a professor in Cultural Studies (I know that becoming a professor is not that easy).\n* **Literature + Comparative literature + ''Asian literature''** = Even though the three would be literature degrees, it makes sense because literature can be a wide subject and my degree is completely unrelated to the second Master's I want to pursue. More useful in SA but less useful if I want to teach in a non-Spanish speaking country.\n\nI'm also accepting different alternatives! Thank you!",

      "text": "For me I would choose Spanish as a foreign language.\n\nEven within a Spanish-speaking country there is demand for a Spanish teacher. You mentioned immigrants speaking Spanish, well they have to learn Spanish at some point, so someone needs to teach then.\n\nBut in light of your plan, why not Spanish as a foreign language first, and then comparative literature (comparing Asian and Hispanophone literatures)?",
