  "text": "Just started a master's 2 weeks ago in the same field as my undergraduate and holy fuck. We're only two weeks in and we already have like 3 projects underway and 2 exams scheduled for later this week. Also the pace of the coursework is much MUCH faster than it was at undergrad and to make it even worse everything is still online so it's harder to talk to professors and other students. Only two weeks in and I already feel like I am falling behind, is this normal?",

      "text": "I did grad school twice (an M.S. and a Ph.D. in different engineering fields at different Universities) and both times the first year was the busiest I've ever been in my life. The coursework expectations are suddenly much higher compared to undergraduate work and the pace in general is much faster, in addition to everything else you might be doing (research, maybe dealing with living somewhere new, etc.)\n\nSo yes, I'd say in my experience this is normal. One thing that's very much not obvious but could put you a little more at ease is that in general (with exceptions) Professors teaching grad students are much less interested in assigning you a grade and much more interested in encouraging you to engage with the material. For example, graduate Transport Phenomena might be the hardest class I ever took, but the Professor told us he'd only ever failed two or three students in about a decade of teaching. Because it's not about passing or failing, it's about learning!",

Your best resources is to talk with your fellow grad students and figure out what works for them and what works for you.  Just remember that most people in the program are like ducks.  They look calm on the surface, but are probably paddling their feet like mad underwater.",

      "text": "It depends. There are still an unfortunate number of programs that operate on the (complete horseshit) design philosophy of \"I suffered so they're going to suffer too\".\nI know someone in an architectural program that was assigned 11 books to read their first week. Whole books. For one class.\n\nAnd then these same programs inevitably take one of two equally absurd positions. It's always \"Why can't we acquire talent???\" or \"Nobody is good enough for OUR team.\"",
