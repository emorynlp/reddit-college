  "text": "So I'm doing a masters in applied linguistics. I kind of stumbled over it. I've been in media and communications for 17 years, and started feeling that I needed to challenge myself and do something stimulating. I like my job, do didn't want to change jobs, and then a masters made sense. Plus, more and more employers seem to require that potential candidates have a masters. \n\nI ended up starting the only course that fulfilled my criteria: part time option, blended learning, relevant for my background and interests. Applied linguistics it was. \n\nI've enjoyed it, learned a lot and I don't regret it.\nFinishing off the coursework these days, and will hopefully submit my thesis in a year.\n\nBut then what. It's hardly a very practical masters. I don't become a \"specialist\". My career interests stay the same. I feel like what I've learned has bern interesting, but sometimes I think that I would have gained the same amount of knowledge had I spent all that time reading great literature... Just not as formalised.\n\nHas your humanities masters actually opened any new doors for you?",

          "text": "Thank you!\nWhen reading your reply I started thinking that I should probably change my resume and tailor my future application letters.. I don't think just adding this MA on the top of my resume will ever be the one thing that sets me apart from other candidates. Every man and his dog has a masters these days, and many in very \"concrete\" areas that are easy for employers to (at least pretend to) understand, such as \"strategic communication management\" or \"digital marketing\" etc. Mine will probably by itself be received more like \"so you did a masters, good for you\". My thesis will be super geeky and only interesting to myself and maybe my supervisor... (I just want to dig into something that I think is interesting). \nBut cleverly including the insights I've gained from studying into my application letter and bio could make me stand out from the crowd.\n\nI have a bit of a pet hate with comm job description that are so wide and general, but require \"a masters degree\". In what? We do so many different things. We can't formally specialise in all of it.",
