  "text": "Hello everyone. I was worried earlier about my fate as a graduate student because I thought I was going to end up with another C. Well, it turns out that I passed the course in question with a B! Not only that, but also my GPA rose much higher than expected (I don't think the calculators even showed me this), taking me out of my academic probation completely (I am over a 3.0)!!! I can rest easier now, and I have more confidence in applying to fellowships for now (if I do in the foreseeable future). I intend to do even better in the coming semesters so that this academic jeopardy should never occur again.",
