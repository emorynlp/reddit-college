  "text": "Had a Professor who completely blew off all of my emails towards the end of the semester, minus one that I will explain shortly. Keep in mind that I\u2019m going to online school so email is the only method of communication. The last email he sent me was in the day of the final after I had taken the exam. He told me point blank that \u201csometimes things fall under the radar\u201d\u2026 I have since filed a formal complaint with the school, but I\u2019m sure he only got a stern talking to if anything at all. \n\n I will have him at least one more time. \n The program I\u2019m in is very small so you have a lot of the professors at least twice. Part of me fears the same thing is going to happen again, except worse because he knows I filed a formal complaint. I\u2019m thinking he\u2019ll be a lot stricter in grading my assignments in the future\u2026 I have since reached out to him again to ask him about an upcoming networking event, but he has ignored that email too. I\u2019m wondering what my options here are now that I\u2019ve already filed a formal complaint but he chooses to be passive aggressive. I don\u2019t want to drop the program (not yet at least)",

      "text": "Generally the professor should have no idea who filed the complaint, if your university is professional and smart about it. Even in the worst case you should be fine, unless you\u2019ve received true animosity from this person, they probably are just poor at emails (albeit irresponsible of them). You also have to think about how many emails a professor gets in a day - other students, department, spam, etc. Don\u2019t hesitate to follow up.\n\nAlso, without other context I don\u2019t see anything here as passive aggressive. Only that they are careless with staying on top of stuff.",

I thought he was being passive aggressive THIS time because I filed the complaint\u2026 figured he\u2019d know it was me, because in one of my emails I said if he didn\u2019t respond I would file a complaint, albeit I said it more professionally than how I just did",

I was using the Microsoft student to prof email and they wanted emails to go through the lms service. I\u2019m not saying this is what happened to you but maybe ask where he would like emails to go? Ask for email etiquette clarification. Again, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s your fault I\u2019m just giving you my experience with online school emails.",
