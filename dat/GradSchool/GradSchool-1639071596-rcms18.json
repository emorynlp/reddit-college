  "text": "Hello guys,\n\nAs you can see from the title, my GRE score (unofficial) is 160V 160Q, currently waiting on my AWA score. Thought I'd come here for some advice. I completed my undergrad in Finance and minored in Math with a pretty crappy CGPA 3.00 (3.3 in major) from Penn State. I was hoping to apply to grad school for either master's or Ph.D. in math, stats, data science, computer science, financial engineering. This score has rocked me (lol), not sure whether I can apply to any top schools or not. My predicament is that I'm an international student and would like to work in the US postgrad so I'm hoping to get into a good enough grad school to make that happen.\n\nIf this relates to you or someone adjacent, I would be open to any and all advice. I'm banking a fair bit of my admission on GRE score + essays + work experience + research + Letters of Recommendation (expecting something above average) -- I've read frequently that a good enough GRE score can somewhat complement a low GPA.\n\nThankfully I have another year to retake the exam if need be, so would be open to thoughts on that as well.",

      "text": "I would probably take some practice tests and retake the GRE. The test is becoming optional at a lot of institutions, but it can help counteract a lower GPA if you have high scores. That said, I know people with lower GPA/GRE scores that still got into top programs because they had excellent letters of recommendation and research experience. I've consistently heard faculty say LoRs and research experience matter more than grades, but there are still some faculty that require certain minimums for their students.",
