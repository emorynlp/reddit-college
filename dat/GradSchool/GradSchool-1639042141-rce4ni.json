  "title:": "Mastering out of PhD after 5 years",
  "text": "I have been enrolled in a STEM PhD in the US for the last 5 years but I have finally decided to exit with a masters.\n\nI feel like I have tried everything and nothing seems to have worked. The passion I once had is long gone due to numerous factors, most of which were beyond my control. About halfway through I fell into extreme depression and ever since I've just been stumbling and just going along on autopilot. I sought out professional help, medication and even had a semester long leave of absence. A couple of years later I started feeling better mentally but had little drive left to finish my PhD. I did enough so my advisor wouldn't fire me but I fell into the trap of sunk cost fallacy without realizing that it would only jeopardize my mental health again. Now I'm just treated like an outcast by my lab mates and my advisor doesn't really have much faith in me either. I tried to fight my way out of it but I'll have to be content with a masters. My only regret is that I wish I did it sooner rather than when I was left with no other choice. I won't get a PhD but I'll save my mental health from going down the drain again. \n\nI have already started the process after consulting my department so there shouldn't be any more roadblocks. I have one class that I'll have to take in spring so I have some time to look for jobs. As an international student it will be quite difficult but I'm not too worried about it. Worst case I'll just go back to my home country and find something there. Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to let it out.",

      "text": "My computer science PhD advisor told me that he expected a third of his students would master out to head to industry because there are very good nonacademic options. He said if fewer than a third mastered out, he wasn't doing his job as an advisor telling people about the options. And if more than a third mastered out, then he needed to work on his graduate program! I ended up being one of the third. Not a single second of regret.",

Sure it would have saved more time if you would have made the decision earlier but the time wasn't right then. Your adviser was allowing you the time to figure things out and I'm glad you. I hope you have enough love for your subject to continue to work in the area and I hope you find meaningful employment",

I went to a job search seminar for senior grad students in my uni and they said pretty much everything can be a transferable skill if you can present it correctly. For example: organizational skills, public speaking and presentations, data management etc. I know some international STEM PhD students in my program who are using their OPT to work in science publishing/editorial type jobs.",

      "text": "Make sure all those things you feel are coming from your lab mates or your supervisor aren't your own guilt or shame. Sometimes we sabotage our own environment due to our inner feelings and confuse it with it coming from outside. You have nothing to be ashamed about, eventually you study inorder to have a better life and so if it messes with your health, it's no longer worth it. Your health is far important. I say all this because I got a vibe of giving up from your side. Don't settle for anything less than the best for you, just don't give up. Fail a 1000 times and try again, everything is about hardwork, make failure a stepping stone and be all that you can be. You can be the best in anything, you just have to believe it.",
