  "text": "So, I've got an idea of the topic that I want to do but it's very broad. I'm currently doing a literature review right now and trying to identify some limitations/challenges with current methods that I can try to narrow it down. I have to propose my research plan next semester and I'm struggling to formulate my project in terms of a single, experimental question.\n\nBasically I'm starting with, \"I want to do X\" (substitute something ambitious like \"cure cancer\" for X but with a reasonable qualifier like \"by studying the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment\") and I can't seem to figure out how to narrow it down to one thing. In this example, there's a lot of ways to study the tumor microenvironment. How do I pick one without already being an expert?",

      "text": "I feel like the typical response is reading.  You have an idea, look to the literature.  See what's been done and what hasn't.  One of the big things thats helped me, that may or may not be relevant, is what skills do you want to acquire?  As in, what skillsets do you not have that you want to have when you come out of your Ph.D.  This led me to that field of research and allowed me to combine the two, so I bug my PI asking what they think.  I think one of the best pieces of advice I got is that the dissertation has to be measurable, but that doesn't mean that the project can't have aspects incorporated that are outside of the dissertation write up",
