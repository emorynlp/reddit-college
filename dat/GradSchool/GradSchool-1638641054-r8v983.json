  "title:": "Weird question: have you asked someone in your department out? How did it go?",
  "text": "Say there was a trainee professor in a different research group that sometimes socialises with a few in your group who was a really nice person and very easy to talk to. Let\u2019s also say that there was a department social at the beginning of November which you and this person went to and talked for a bit as an introduction.\n\nNow, is it good form for me as a second year phd student to ask this person out? They aren\u2019t related to my professional work so there\u2019s no conflict of interest that stands out to me. I think it\u2019s an unwise decision because of the conflict of interest and sheer awkwardness it would bring about in the department.",

      "text": "I have never heard of a \u201ctrainee professor\u201d before. Maybe it is something that is field or country specific?\n\nThat said, if she is faculty in your department and you are a student, then the answer is an easy, simple no. You should not ask them out. \n\nIt is ok for you to meet people in your program, but this doesn\u2019t sound like that anyway. Your interactions with this *colleague* have all been within a professional setting. I would be pretty annoyed if a grad student asked me out after chatting at a few meetings. A few mixer chats in your department is not the same as actually knowing this person. If you\u2019re going to ask her out for a romantic date, you should know her enough to know you like *her* not just the idea of her. Your colleagues should not also double as your dating pool and if you\u2019re going to take the risk of dating within your department, you should be very considerate of the position you are putting the other party in.",

Granted, we were both also PhD students when we started dating, so it sounds like the situation you present may have a different power dynamic that would make it not a good idea. There was some hesitancy on our part because we were in the same research group, so even though my spouse was a few years ahead of me in the program, it still would have made for an awkward couple of years if we broke up.  But... it worked out awesomely for us- we've been together for around 8 years and are still going strong.",

That is, it seems like you hardly know her. You should try befriending her first. \n\nIf you wanted to say- go bowling or have some drinks with friends, that's one thing. Many Japanese business encourage such group bonding activities. However, it's another to go straight for an intimate setting with just the two of you. In short, it's a lot easier to maintain a professional relationship with someone who said no to \"bowling with friends\" as opposed to \"having dinner alone\".",
