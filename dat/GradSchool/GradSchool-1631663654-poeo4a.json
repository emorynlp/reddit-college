  "title:": "NSF GRFP GPA if new to program",
  "text": "Hello all, I'm applying for the NSF GRFP for the second and final time as a fresh graduate student (last year I was applying for programs). My institution does use grades (GPA), but as I'm new to my program, I don't have grades yet. The application asks whether your institution uses grades and what your cumulative GPA is.\n\nIf I'm new to my program, do I just put 4.0? I've tried to look for information on this, and I can't find anything. My institution doesn't provide me with a GPA so early (since... I don't have grades yet). What have others done?\n\nThanks!",
