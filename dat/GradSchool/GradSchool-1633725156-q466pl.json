  "title:": "Can someone give me an idea of what tier of graduate school I should bother applying for? (pure math)",
  "text": "# \n\nJust the facts, I attend Columbia University and I have a GPA of 3.81. This is my third year here, and so far I have taken \\~9 senior-level math courses. I'm currently taking two grad-level analysis courses.\n\nI also transferred from state university where I spent 2 years in (GPA: 4.00, but courseworks are very weak - only took calculus, linear algebra, proof writing, and ODE).\n\nRecommendation letters will be very weak, or generic at best, and research experience, non-existent.\n\nNo extracurricular, and my math GRE test is 780 (70%). But I think I will do better in the next upcoming exam.\n\nI want to study probability theory or PDE's. Mostly I just did bunch of self-studies and didn't really have any connection here.\n\nI do not intend to have pipe dreams of going into T10 schools, although I will apply for UCLA and NYU. Otherwise, I only want to apply somewhere I have a decent chance in. Can someone give me any suggestions?",

          "text": "Agree; not a pure math PhD person myself, but I did a BA in pure and poli sci (what I\u2019m doing my doctorate in now). For PDEs, I had a professor who only did PDE research that went to University of Arkansas and another who did some PDE work that went to University of Kentucky. There are some less competitive R1s that are very good for certain areas, like PDEs, so don\u2019t feel that you should be disappointed if you don\u2019t get into a T5! A couple of the folks I graduated my math program went on to use this strategy, and they\u2019re all doing very well and have a pub each (we\u2019re all going into year 3-4). \n\nIf you don\u2019t know where to start (and this will help you by giving a professor something to write about in a rec letter), make an office hours appointment to discuss research opportunities, good places to apply, and try to get in with some early grad students. The junior grad students will sometimes let undergrads in our department into research groups if they\u2019re taking some lower level grad classes because you\u2019re methodologically/conceptually able to keep up with them in class. I know this will be different in pure math, but I do think you can start making connections and get some 4th or 5th author credit in a year with not a huge amount of effort! \n\nBiggest thing is to work on your rec letters. My dad was a stat PhD but did 2 years of a pure math PhD before switching, and he came from UT Austin. He didn\u2019t have great rec letters and so he had to do a Masters before continuing. All the while, he didn\u2019t have pubs (though I think this is the standard in pure anyways)! So, his advice when I was applying to my poli sci PhD programs was to be memorable and utilize office hours. Your statement of purpose should also take you a good deal of time\u2014make it extremely clear how you fit in their department. I wouldn\u2019t apply to more than about 6-7 programs because customizing this takes such a long time. \n\nBest of luck; you can turn this around a lot more than you think with a little bit of effort with the right folks!",

It\u2019s uncommon precisely because professors do not want to mentor undergraduates and there is no pressure for them to do so because it is wholly unnecessary. Plus, you won\u2019t have done enough math to do anything vaguely useful in research until part way through the actual PhD. Math PhDs frequently graduate without a single publication, and that\u2019s fine, and expected, and not in any way something that is looked down upon.\n\nI\u2019m at a top math institution (Cambridge) and not a **single** person here in the PhD program had done research as an undergrad. And these are the best applicants in the world.",

Take a gap year if you have no other choice and work with as many people who can put in a good word as possible. Especially in US admissions it is the first thing they look at.
