In addition, it had a slightly scientific bent, and caused us to tackle the question of what the future would be like if we all lived for hundreds of years. It was extremely compelling, eye-opening, and stimulating. Definitely take it! He also teaches a Sociology of Happiness class (his area of expertise) and I've heard great things about it. ",

Instead of the standard \"I'm the professor, so take everything I say as truth,\" nearly *every* statement he made about a mechanism/mutation/etc was backed up by a paper. He also had a required journal reading meeting once a week, which was great for teaching you how to read and understand scientific papers.\n\nCell Bio with Dr. Eisen. Super cool guy, interesting class setup, really broad topics covered. Class is based off primary literature.\n\nCancer Bio with Dr. Orloff. Incredibly smart man, really loves what he teaches, incredibly entertaining lecturer. Again, class is based off primary literature, sometimes incredibly recently published (we read a paper in January that was published the previous September).\n\nAnd, I'd just like to echo the Dr. Weinschenk comment. Totally awesome guy. Really loves organic.",
