  "text": "Hey! I\u2019m an incoming first year and am wondering about the best classes/professors I should be sure to take and worst classes/professors I should be sure to avoid. I\u2019m into political science and taking other humanities classes but I really just wanna use my first couple semesters to find more passions and take classes I\u2019m interested in. Anything helps!!",

At the same time, take some of those reviews with a grain of salt because sometimes good professors that are difficult get disproportionately lower reviews",

      "text": "Depends entirely on what subjects you like/dislike but some classes and professors I\u2019d recommend, Thomas Bing - Physics, David Barba -Film 107, Fossati- CS. I\u2019d say for your first semester take maybe 4-5 classes cause you have PACE and hlth as an add on if I remember correctly. Split your classes in half by what you think you might major in and the other take random GER\u2019s",

Definitely consider taking one or some of them:[http://college.emory.edu/voluntary-core/index.html](http://college.emory.edu/voluntary-core/index.html)\n\nSome are offered every year, so you can use the current/outdated listings and see what Fall 2021 in the course atlas shows them as being offered. Do keep in mind that more courses will be added by April 23 to the atlas so the current listings aren't complete:  [https://atlas.emory.edu/](https://atlas.emory.edu/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey tend to choose the best instructors/those that actually want to develop and interact with undergrads.",
