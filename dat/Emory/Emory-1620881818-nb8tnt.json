  "title:": "Blocked by professor on GroupMe??",
  "text": "I sent an email to my professor not too long ago but wasn't getting a response. Because the grading period is closing soon, I wanted to make sure he saw the email before it was too late, so I messaged him on GroupMe after about a day or two just letting him know I had sent him a message. Today I tried to see if I could find my message to him on GroupMe but only my dms with him didn't load on my phone. When I went on my laptop and checked my message was sent, but his profile picture was replaced with a default and his name showed up as \"\" instead of the name and pic I saw in the class group chat... did I get blocked or is this just some glitch? No other profile functions like this, and before I sent the message I was definitely able to see his name and profile picture.\n\nAm I being dumb? How can I get in contact with him? Is it disrespectful to try to ask them about something beyond the final?",

I only used private message since after the final it appeared as if he stopped checking the main chat. I'd never had to email him in the past, but having spoken to other students more it seems like a lot have had difficulty contacting him through email.",

This sounds very strange for a faculty member (as in lecture track or tenure track full time faculty).  If so, keep in mind commencement and a bunch of other end of year activities are happening.  For grad. students(like I know each spring, ever since chem unbound rolled out, chem takes advantage of a program where they employ a teaching inclined graduate student in the middle of writing their dissertation), for all you know they could have just defended their thesis/did their dissertation and are in the middle of transitioning to their next career step so are slammed.",

I remember me and most undergrads loving profs. who gave us grace so I try to reciprocate having seen and experienced weird stuff that goes on behind the scenes.  I just remember that we are human.  If things get really inappropriate or were a problem all semester then I worry.  But often we rewarded lazy professors who didn't have time to challenge/help us really learn at a good level (as if they OWE us an easy course with mostly high grades which they don't and probably would rather not teach courses that way) or support us(and punish those who do) and all types of things so if they slip up or have some issues at the end of the semester, as long as it doesn't really harm me, I give them grace.",
