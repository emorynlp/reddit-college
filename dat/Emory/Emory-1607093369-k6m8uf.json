      "text": "It is probably okay though a bit busy (but if that is what you want in these pandemic times, go for it I guess.  Only you can figure out what you can handle) but I think YOU are the best guage of this.  What was the schedule this semester and how do you feel about it difficulty wise?  If it was challenging, was it at least manageable to you/did you welcome it or were you just frustrated that it was challenging, because there will likely be some challenge in this spring schedule.  Doesn't mean you won't do well but if fighting for good grades vs. cruising to them makes you uncomfortable then you may be uncomfortable (I hear that math 210 can be tough for example) especially if you made this(fall) semester light or it felt easy.\n\n I think linear really depends on the professor but many people who like calculus don't respond as well to linear likely because it requires a different style of thinking and logic. Unless you had a similar schedule this semester and found everything fairly easy, expect a shift this semester and be open to dropping one of the courses.  Like maybe kick the linear can to fall or Spanish. And BBA pre-reqs just need to be done before applying so financial accounting can wait till sophomore year.  Just finish up your econ stuff for now.",
