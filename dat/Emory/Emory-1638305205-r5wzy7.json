It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a lot more girls than guys here (about 59% to 41%).\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m a guy and I think the same applies for girls. The average girl at Emory isn\u2019t going to be as conventionally attractive as female students from other schools. It\u2019s a little less noticeable compared to the guys because of how many girls are actually here but I still think it holds true.\n\nThat being said, like someone else mentioned, if you don\u2019t emphasize looks heavily in people you\u2019re attracted to then it\u2019s not a big deal. I think there are definitely a good amount of people here that are awesome even if they don\u2019t look like models/aren\u2019t super cute.",
