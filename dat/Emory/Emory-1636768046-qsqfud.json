  "text": "Soo I just had my interview for Emory and I thought it went pretty good to be honest.  I think I did more question asking than the interviewer though :(. Do these alumni interviews have a big impact on our Admission? (I applied ED) I keep seeing a bunch of posts both saying that do n other that say they don\u2019t. Overall it was a dope experience n I pray I get in\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff",

It's like, if you compare really closely with another applicant, and the admissions people are split on your whether or not to admit you, they would consult the alumni for further info. As long as you did not come off as an asshole it probably went fine",
