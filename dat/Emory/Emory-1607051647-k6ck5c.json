  "text": " Hi, I don't qualify for the QuestBridge scholars program because my family makes too much, but we also aren't rich so it will be hard to pay for college if I were to get accepted here. I know that Emory gives their own financial aid but I heard that you have to pay it back later on? Is it better to apply for scholarships than get FAFSA money? If you got Hope and Zell miller scholarships, how much did they help in the cost? thank you :)",

I did qualify for questbridge and was a finalist, but I got into Emory qbrd, so I didn\u2019t get the match package and I only pay my efc. My tuition was completely covered by an Emory university grant, and I\u2019m paying very little in loans for like meal plan and insurance. Housing was also covered in my grant because it was more than the tuition price.",
