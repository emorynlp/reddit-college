  "text": "I left Emory two years ago, but now I'm thinking of returning.  I remember enjoying my time at Emory but I had some personal issues I needed to deal with.  Anyway now I intend to return to school to major in CS and become a software engineer, but I've heard different things about the CS department at Emory.  What do you guys think?  ",

      "text": "Emory CS differentiates itself from other schools by offering a liberal arts education. This may be pretty obvious (as Emory brands itself as a liberal arts school), but the implications aren\u2019t always as obvious. \n\nLet\u2019s compare Emory\u2019s CS program to GT\u2019s. At Emory, you\u2019ll spend less time in CS classes. There are fewer classes in the CS curriculum here. Emory\u2019s CS program also isn\u2019t top-10. That said, you\u2019ll graduate as a much more rounded student. You won\u2019t have the deepest knowledge of CS, but you will have taken many classes outside your major. I\u2019ve, for example, taken a lot of physics and Econ classes that fascinate me. I believe that makes me a more rounded and competitive candidate. \n\nIt\u2019s a big decision you\u2019ll have to make - do you want to be a specialist (go to GT and get a deep CS education) or a more diverse and rounded graduate (Emory and take lots of non-CS classes). \n\n\n\nSource: I\u2019m currently at Emory, will graduate with a BS in comp sci. I\u2019ve got friends in CS at GT",

They hire from both liberal arts schools and technical schools - you really just need to impress them with your GPA and outside programming projects. Where the liberal arts / technical differences appear, I believe, is further into your career. While I don't have data to support this, I see liberal arts-minded programmers as better leaders. They're better equipped to handle Product Manager positions with their diverse education.\n\nJust my two cents - definitely post on USC and GT subreddits to get their inputs.",

I don't really need to work at a super prestigious company.  But it seems like people say that Emory is good for most majors overall, except with CS I hear a lot of different things.\n\nIf the truth leans more towards the negative, though, I'm ok with looking for another thing to do.",

One of the reasons I want to go back (not a main, pivotal reason don't worry) is to regain casual access to the libraries again and read all the great books that my local public libraries just don't have (same goes for local college libraries,).while learning a discipline i can enjoy and make a living at.\n\nI've heard of the creative writing program.   While writing fiction is something I'd like to excel at one day... people have hinted to me that I'm not very good at it so I probably should focus on other things for now heh heh.  But still I'd like to take a shot at it!\n\n\nSo basically, I'm interested in literature and film.  \nI partially want to learn programming so I can design games too, but that's like a side goal.\n",
