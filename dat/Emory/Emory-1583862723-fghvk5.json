  "text": "Hi all, hope you've been enjoying spring break. \n\nIn light of recent news about other schools suspending classes or closing for the semester and shifting online, I'm curious to see what our community thinks about Emory doing the same. How does Emory normally respond to things like this? \n\nOf course everything about this post is speculative but I think it would be productive to have a discussion anyway.\n\n\nEDIT: It's official.... school's cancelled",
