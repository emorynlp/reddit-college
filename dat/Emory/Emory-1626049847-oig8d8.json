  "text": "I have work study included in my package and I was wondering which work study jobs are relaxed. By relaxed, I mean jobs where I\u2019d be able to study. For instance, we had a similar thing in my High school and our job was to basically be in the library and help people check out books and print. People rarely come and ask for this so I was able to do assignments at work. Are there any similar positions at Emory?",
