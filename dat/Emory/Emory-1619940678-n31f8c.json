  "text": "Is this combination possible? Read somewhere on this forum that a joint program counts as one major, couldn't back that up though. If it is, would this combination it be feasible if I have a good number of AP credits? \n\nI'm deadset on studying CS at the very least, but the application and interdisciplinary focus of QSS really drew me in. I think the overlap between the two will make also make it manageable. Problem is that I want to also take advantage of the great business program at Emory. Have heard great things about it from my brother who is a current grad student at Goizeuta. Don't know if pursuing all three will burn me out though.",

              "text": "Double majors aren\u2019t as important as you might think. Employers usually don\u2019t care about the specifics of your degree honestly. If I were you, I\u2019d just get a CS degree and take classes in the QTM, Econ, or business departments that you think would be useful for your career.\n\n If you do double major, I\u2019d recommend doing it in departments that aren\u2019t that similar. No point in being a CS and QTM double major because they achieve too similar of things in the eyes of employers. Business CS is a great double major. And there\u2019s analytics classes in the business school that are similar to QTM as well.",

      "text": "Yeah you need to make a choice. ALL of these have good outcomes and great prod. development opps. Maybe take a couple of requirements for CS and QSS(and then BBAs next year) as a first year (you can also think about the informatics degree which is very busy but at least possible) and decide what you like: Don't let the \"prestige\" of the b-school distract you. Decide if you like math/data science in context of another discipline or not and move forward from there.  Just keep in mind that your first and 2nd year WILL be far more intensive than average, especially vs. other people considering the b-school.\n\n Be prepared to work and think hard and even be stressed at times (and due to more than just an HS transition and having to develop different study habits. Some QTM math pre-reqs and QTM core classes are just intentionally tough/complex and I think CS intros can be tough too) and also be prepared to give yourself grace if your GPA isn't perfect or but you had to really sweat for a good one. Remember that many of your classes are made to purposefully challenge you which will likely not be the case of many of your non-QSS peers (who will appear to sort of just breeze through their first 2 years).  You'll have to be able to look forward/think about longterm benefits.",

Do agree with your longterm benefit perspective. I'm not too worried about excelling academically as long as I can develop relevant industry skills and projects in the courses I take.",

              "text": "I think the trick about harder college math and quantitatively intensive courses is a) Getting used to the fact that the better teachers WILL ask you to solve problem types that weren't assigned for practice, b) often questions may be much more conceptual (they'll ask \"why this?\", \"prove\" or \"show\" this relationship, \"how do you know this\"?), and then c), in some QTM courses, you are doing your analysis and math based upon figures/data sets vs. just manipulation of equations with numbers to be plugged in that were given in a word problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEssentially you may have to build new types of problem solving skills that are more important for industry and research but may very well be uncomfortable and take a couple of courses to adjust to.  Usually what early career undergraduates expect (especially high achievers at places like Emory) in STEM is that the college will just be a faster paced version of their AP/better HS classes, so they'll set up these expectations where they think exams should and will DIRECTLY reflect practice problems and lecture notes vs. requiring extrapolation or derivation from them.\n\nThe former usually means that if you learn the problem types in the notes and practice, you just have to remember to apply the algorithm on the tests or projects because they'll just change the numbers or the framing of the word problem slightly.  The latter may require you to connect several concepts or even \"guess\" a little in terms of how to apply what you learned and practiced to the new problem.  And then you have courses like QTM 110(honestly probably one of the most important classes in the core BECAUSE of how different it is I am betting) which are very qualitative and focus on asking you about research and experimental design.  That is also something that an early career undergrad. may end up uncomfortable with because you may have to get a little creative.  So it isn't necessarily that the courses will have more work perse, but that you may have to adjust your study and practice habits to deal with the style of rigor they demand vs. HS.  Much less drilling of definitions and terms and specific problem types vs. trying to see connections between problem types and understanding (math oriented QTM cores) when you see definitions and terms in context (QTM 110).\n\nIf you can keep an open mind and not project expectations based upon how you learned and were tested in HS, you'll probably do better than a lot of people.  This is also a problem in courses like math 116 which lots of life sciences majors take.  It incorporates mathematical modelling and stuff that those w/AP experience weren't taught was \"math\" so the latter group thinking they are \"it\" closes their mind off and struggles through the material more than they should:  [https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.10-03-0026](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.10-03-0026)\n\nThere is a brief allusion to that type of \"experienced\" student in the section called \"Issues and Future Directions\" in this old paper on the math 116 sequence. I imagine it applies to those pursuing these rigorous mathematical/statistics tracks with modelling, machine learning, etc. Try not to be them and be biased on what math is about based on HS or else experience/exposure may just be in vain or be more of an impediment than advantage in some courses.",
