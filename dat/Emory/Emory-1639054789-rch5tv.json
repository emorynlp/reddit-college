  "text": "I have my ed1 tomorrow, and I want to be prepared for the worst, and Emory was another interest of mine. From my post yesterday, sounds like this school offers opportunities with just a bachelors job wise, which is my intended goal due to not really wanting a Masters right now.\n\nI have good stats besides SAT/ACT so that\u2019s not necessarily my worry, I\u2019m just wondering if it offers a good boost because I heard Emory likes legacies?\n\nThanks",
