I\u2019m from the Northeast and I\u2019m Jewish and Asian. Additionally, I will be coming to study Pre-Medicine which further sets me apart. \n\nStats: \n\nHeight: 6\u20193\n\nWeight: 210\n\nBench: 450\n\nSquat: 500\n\nDeadlift: 300 (I know it\u2019s below the median so I think I won\u2019t submit this one)\n\nMisdemeanors: 17\n\nLife Sentences: 3\n\nECs: Alcoholism, Divorced Parents, top 0.0001% listener of Drake according to Spotify wrapped. \n\nPlease let me know if I have a chance, I\u2019m super nervous.",
