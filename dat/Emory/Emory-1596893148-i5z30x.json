      "text": "I was placed in Spanish 201 and Korean 201 last Spring. I have never taken any formal courses (not even in high school) so I, too, was nervous about having to \"catch up.\" I felt that way when I took CS 171 and 224 at the same time after transferring CS 170 and MATH 111 without any real refresher (the transfer credit was late so I was taking both classes for several weeks before I withdrew).\n\nSo I can't help you with the difficulty, but I share how you feel. I enrolled in JPN 101 instead and I'm looking to switch it to RUSS 101. The only thing I'm worried about is the lack of consistent 300-level courses for RUSS.",

              "text": "I did not take SPAN 201, I only got placed there. It was odd because I specified I had no Spanish background, no Spanish-speaking family members, and never took Spanish in high school/college.\n\nI just answered the test and got an email I got placed in 201. I don't have too much interest in it and took the test out of curiosity.\n\nKorean was different because apart from the exam, there was an essay portion and an oral interview. I learned a bit of Korean while I worked there. I guess that was enough. Got placed in 201 as well. Also took the test out of curiosity.",
