  "text": "Hey y'all I'm a accepted soph transfer that had a question ab transfer housing. I was gonna wait until closer to the deadline for the commitment date in order to have a chance to see if I got into other schools. I was wondering what the transfer housing situation is like, and if it's difficult to get valid on campus housing at the end of May? Thanks y'all.",
