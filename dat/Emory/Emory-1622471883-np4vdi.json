In addition, many Universities students with academic diffi culties and no prior diagnosis are seen and assessed through the academic screening and assessment process. I also a m the director of supervision, training and coordination of counseling psychology and clinical psychology graduate s tudents of the United States who have practicums at DHHS and APA-accredited school psychology pre-doctoral inte rns.
