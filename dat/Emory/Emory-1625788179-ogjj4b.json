      "text": "Curious to know your proficiency levels with each of these languages but from the perspective of someone who has taken SPAN201 (and currently taking SPAN202), I would say that the professors are pretty chill overall.\n\nAlthough some might be a bit more uptight than others when it comes to classroom dynamics and structure, I would suggest getting a prof who is 1) preferably Hispanic themselves for more \"inside scoop\" tricks and tips and/or 2) is upbeat and genuinely excited to teach.\n\nThe professors I had were [Prof. Travers](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2623480) (6/10 for me) and now [Prof. Sierra](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1202100&showMyProfs=true) (8/10 for me). Although mixed reviews for both profs, hope this helps on the Spanish side!",

              "text": "I think Prof. Sierra will be a bit more chill than Prof. Travers, especially since Sierra's main goal is for everyone to do well in the class while also having fun learning the material.\n\nOverall, IMO Prof. Sierra is the move in congruence with your situation, but if you end up loving Spanish in the end, perhaps a prof with a bit more rigor incorporated in their class would be more beneficial in the future.\n\nExcellent question!",
