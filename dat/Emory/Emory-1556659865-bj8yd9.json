  "text": "hi! i am an accepted student for the class of 2023 and i'm having a bit of trouble trying to decide. emory is one of my top choices but i'm \n\ni'm interested in studying business, entrepreneurship and technology but also being open to philosophy econ and sociology (a lot i know!) although im interested in consulting i want to stay open to many options to find what will best suit me \n\n\nconcerns i have \n-social life (i know there's no sports as well, i think that can be both a pro and con depending on the person) \n-tech? i know there's no engineering school, are the STEM classes ok at emory\n-the general vibe? i visited but i love to hear any opinions \n\nalso i just wanted to say i'm so thankful to be given this opportunity to attend emory and have choices that i enjoy, would just love some advice and i know this might be a small predicament compared to other issues",

You should look into QTM/QSS here. It's a good way to combine sociology and business.",

      "text": "I am gonna  mainly drop links and stick to what I know.  Just note that having an engineering school does NOT correlate with STEM undergraduate educational quality.  INVESTING (faculty and monetary resources) specifically in undergraduate STEM education and caring about it/constantly enhancing and revamping it is.  Note that GBS has an entrepreneurship concentration and that there is a social innovation hall (with a smaller immersion community you can apply to if you wanna do a project/get mentoring as a freshman:  [https://housing.emory.edu/reslife/communities/fye\\_immersion\\_themes.html](https://housing.emory.edu/reslife/communities/fye_immersion_themes.html) ) that has led to interesting projects that have gone on to compete in the Hult Prize competition.  Either way, Emory is very strong in STEM education, especially if you are more into chemistry and life sciences like biology or neuroscience.  I'll let you gather what you can from these links that display its investment/attempt to constantly improve or different things that show its effectiveness, many/most of these are in the last 5 years or so, but there is a long track record of investment and keeping things \"fresh\" and modern.  Of course no school will be perfect, but the effort actually matters.  You can't assume that the STEM courses are good and modern simply because a school is top ranked.  Some places are very traditional and could care less because \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\":\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2019/02/upress\\_aau\\_stem\\_grant/index.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2019/02/upress_aau_stem_grant/index.html)\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/09/er\\_chemistry\\_curriculum/campus.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/09/er_chemistry_curriculum/campus.html)\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/05/upress\\_hhmi\\_chemistry\\_grant/campus.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2014/05/upress_hhmi_chemistry_grant/campus.html)\n\n[http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2010/05/emory-receives-1.8-million-hhmi-grant-for-science-education.html#.XMjWsOhKi00](http://shared.web.emory.edu/emory/news/releases/2010/05/emory-receives-1.8-million-hhmi-grant-for-science-education.html#.XMjWsOhKi00)\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/10/er\\_bean\\_beetle\\_nsf\\_grant/campus.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2018/10/er_bean_beetle_nsf_grant/campus.html)\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/10/er\\_biology\\_labs\\_revamp/campus.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/10/er_biology_labs_revamp/campus.html)\n\n\\*The one right above this actually tells how long Emory has been seeking (successfully) such funding.\n\nSome teaching (in an intro. class at that) has actually led to unexpected entrepreneurial endeavors (which tend to happen despite Emory lacking engineering):\n\n[https://hypepotamus.com/companies/emory-pre-med-students-build-better-ebola-test/](https://hypepotamus.com/companies/emory-pre-med-students-build-better-ebola-test/)\n\n[https://emorywheel.com/freshmen-advance-to-hult-prize-finals/](https://emorywheel.com/freshmen-advance-to-hult-prize-finals/)\n\n[http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/03/er\\_hult\\_prize/campus.html](http://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/03/er_hult_prize/campus.html)\n\nAnd a super cool freshman seminar I did that was very interdisciplinary and inspired a lot of the changes in intro (and other). STEM courses:\n\n[http://www.order.emory.edu/about/index.html](http://www.order.emory.edu/about/index.html) (website is dated, but course still exists)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, there are lots of opps for you to get involved in some sort of entrepreneurial scene and this effort to consolidate the resources and provide specific training for it may help:\n\n[http://innovate.emory.edu/opportunity/index.html](http://innovate.emory.edu/opportunity/index.html)\n\nWhen I was at Emory, I was appreciating Emory's efforts in STEM to move away from pure lecture/passive learning that often stressed memorization to more engaged/active styles of learning that emphasized students being exposed to real applications, research, and higher level problem solving.  Again, this was also happening in a lot of introductory courses (as suggested above), which is a less common movement elsewhere. Duke has also done a lot of work in that arena as well and has fairly robust special programs for undergraduates that may be into entrepreneurial endeavors too.  I don't know enough about USC, but it is likely a bit different because of its size.  Unless you are ultra prestige/rank obsessed, perhaps choose between the two very different but cheaper schools (USC and Emory) based upon whatever criteria you value most.  Emory lacking engineering certainly won't give you weaker STEM education (note that most selective and less selective LACs have no engineering and they provide renowned undergraduate STEM education.  They place disproportionate amounts of people into STEM PhD programs and they go on to become tenured faculty).  Again, it isn't perfect, but it clearly invests a lot and I think much of the curriculum really inspires you to actually think more deeply about science. You'd be surprised how many elite schools in life sciences still mainly give you a fairly fast paced version of a basic less selective state school course and prioritize regurgitation of details.  I know Duke and Emory have definitely veered away from that, so you'd be in good hands at either.  Either way, good luck.  If you have any specific questions about this, let me know.",

      "text": "I don't know why people are down-voting you but check out what these other guys said. You'll be fine if you come here, and we'd be happy to have you.  \nThe sports exist but they're more club/small-group oriented rather than bigger sports like football -- we actually have an amazing women's swimming/diving team.\n\nEmory is fantastic for life and social sciences, and pretty good in the physical sciences, though it lacks in the CS/engi department. They're working on improving the CS department now, and they just separated it from the math department a few years ago. There is no doubt that the sciences are alive and well at Emory otherwise. Also, Atlanta is number one in the country for internships so your business/tech interests will not go unexplored.\n\nEmory, in my opinion, is one of those few heavily academic schools with friendly people who have a unique, interpersonal school spirit. They aren't particularly \"rah-rah\" about the school, but we are all proud to have started here. People here seem to think of it more as a stepping stone to bigger things, and that's pretty accurate for most of our grads. Everyone is very chill and open to talking, except for some exceptions from the less-friendly parts of the country. The administration are some of the nicest, coolest people you will ever meet -- and that southern hospitality is very real here without the bad parts of southern culture (imagine the south but liberal and without the yee-yee culture, and there's the general vibe of Atlanta, so basically just sweet tea and nice people).\n\nLet me know if you have any more concerns, there's a lot about Emory just beneath the surface that people don't realize a lot of the time.",

If you're really concerned about it, then look to go elsewhere. But that being said, I came in as an English major and ended up committing to CS. I've taken classes in 15 different departments which is rare in most schools so I think with your broad range of interests, Emory would be a great place.",
