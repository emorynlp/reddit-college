              "text": "Many people coming from HS say \"they are a morning person\", but the definition of \"morning\" often shifts due to the nature and relative lack of structure in college life and how people use (or don't use) the increase in \"free time\".  Like anyone can claim to be a morning person until they choose to socialize, party, or cram(or even study regularly) late into the night/early into the morning (and when a class is boring or seems useless, you may be tempted to blow it off if tired.  And I suspect that ECS 101 has attendance requirements).  As for intensity.  That schedule has some challenge in it but shouldn't be overwhelming if you keep up with anything.  There is nothing mindblowing about financial accounting or DSci. Psych 110 can get a little interesting, but is mainly just content overload at times (My understanding is that Kazama's class is less centered on experiments and how experimental design was used to explain certain concepts and behaviors than Edwards' class so at least you don't have that extra layer of thinking on top of all that you need to sort of brute force memorize).",

I\u2019ve met a bunch of people and made a lot of great friends. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m perfect\u2014I\u2019m definitely still awkward and cringy at times\u2014but you don\u2019t need to be. There\u2019ll be people who like you even in spite of your flaws. Some won\u2019t, but some will, and those are the only people that matter.\n\nIt\u2019s never too late to change yourself or your life and university is a great place to do that. It\u2019s almost like a soft reset of everything you\u2019ve been through so far. Hope you\u2019ll be able to meet more people if you think that\u2019ll make you happy and if you want a friend or just want to talk about things feel free to dm :)",

I came from a school where there's less than 100 people in a cohort and only hangs out with a tiny group but I believe that there'll be much more people matching my personality and energy at Emory.
