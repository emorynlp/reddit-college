      "text": "You wanna compete against a bunch of high achieving people from OOS that may be favored in the process because other regions have better schools?  You think that improves your odds?  Trust me, applying IS Georgia Tech is better odds if you are IS.  And this may even be the case for OOS because Tech is at least a bit more predictable (stats oriented).  On the surface, the OOS rate at Tech is the same as Emory overall and if you are IS, your chances are substantially higher at Tech (Emory is not gonna give a residency advantage as a private school):  https://www.news.gatech.edu/news/2021/03/18/georgia-tech-admission-announces-decisions\n\nIf you wanna do engineering, apply to engineering schools! Period.  Don't hedge your bets on chasing some weird mix of prestige and easier admissions at a place that doesn't even have your program(s) of interest or does them comparably poorly even compared to signficantly less selective (not talking Tech, but places less selective than Emory or Tech that are great STEM institutes or have good engineering schools.  I'm thinking more NC State) places that have engineering.",
