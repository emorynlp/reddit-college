  "text": "Hey y'all! \n\nI was asked to write a letter of evaluation for a professor as part of a major review. (I suspect it has something to do with her process for becoming a tenured professor.) She's one of my favorite professors I've had at Emory, so I want to do a good job!\n\nHas anyone written one such letter? And if so, would you be willing to help me out by answering some questions?",
