      "text": "It\u2019s very easy to take a free Emory shuttle to the Decatur MARTA station and catch the metro to go to many parts of Atlanta \u2014 downtown, midtown, the airport, etc. Look up the MARTA map overlayed on a city map to see where the trains stop. Even if you have a car, MARTA is often easier, especially for large concerts and sporting events since you don\u2019t have the hassle of parking.",
