I bought my friend who graduated this spring a pair of Emory sweats for his bday, but they didn\u2019t fit and I forgot to return them on time.\n\nWould anyone be interested in purchasing? the tags are still on but obviously I wouldn\u2019t sell for full price!! DM if you\u2019re interested and I\u2019ll do my best to prove I\u2019m not a scammer lmao \n\n[it\u2019s the light gray one, XS](https://emory.bncollege.com/shop/emory/product/champion-powerblend-banded-pant?graphicId=APC01835595002&imageId=1900735)",
