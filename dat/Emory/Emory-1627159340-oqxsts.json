We're the official Reddit account of the Dooley's Guard, aka. the moderators of Dooley's Tavern, and we're here today to invite you to Dooley's Tavern!\n\n# What is Dooley's Tavern?\n\nDooley's Tavern is a student-managed Discord server created last year for Emory students to hang out and chat with each other. Feel free to talk with over 1500+ members about a wide array of topics ranging from academics, housing, campus activities, gaming, memes, and more. We aim to create a fun and welcoming community so don't be shy!\n\n# How do I get in?\n\nHere's the link: [**Dooley's Tavern Invite Link**](https://discord.gg/C9RXgdg2BC)\n\n*In order to prevent spam, after joining the server you'll get an automated message to fill out a verification form. After submitting the form, verification will take at most 48 hours (we have to manually verify each person so please be patient). Once verified, you will then be able to access all channels.*\n\nIf you have any problems, questions, or concerns, leave a comment, and we'll try to help : )",
