As in a class that gives you enough hours so that either bio or chem can go, and you maintain full time status if things go awry and you want to drop either (because I think chem..they'll want you to drop lecture and lab, which is 5 hours total).  Otherwise, you're good I guess (looks like you got top tier instructors for chem and bio too).  Just something to think about.  Also, what is you intended major (may determine what you should do if you have an AP/IB in either)?",

I'd say it's a 50:50 w/141 (wouldn't worry about pre-med if doing that because bio requires 2 upper level lab courses which will compensate for it). Basically you are banking on a \"richer\"(at Emory they do case studies and maybe focus on the chemical foundation of some key bio concepts in a way AP may not have. For example, they may go into the structural basis of the blood buffer system and oxygen binding as well as sickle cell) presentation of AP content.\n\nMight happen but the AP curric. in its current form is designed extremely well in terms of serving as a foundation for future research oriented bio courses (as in more relevant/better than many gen. biol 1 courses. Not necessarily harder, but maybe better).   I will say that Abreu is likely an awesome person to establish connections with (serious about mentoring and involved in many mentor programs and heads a new upperclassmen Living Learning Community in science research) , so it can't hurt too bad.  If you do well (as I expect from a recent 5) and enjoy the course, go to office hours, make the connection, and leave an impression! He may help(there bot) you into research or other opps in the bio department.\n\nAnd I was honestly gonna recommend 202z for chem if you had AP chem. You're only delaying the \"orgo\" by 1 semester if you take 150. You basically lose your AP advantage by 202, plus 202z/203z apply \"freshmen friendly\" grading versus regular 202 and 203.  Upside to taking the normal pathway and then doing regular 203 is that you get to take Weinschenk! lol",

Thanks for the reply! \"\n\nI don't understand any of this lol.  There is no need to worry about credit hour NUMBER here (just have 15-19).   Your courses make for a more challenging schedule than most doing 19.  The hours is not what makes them challenging, the assignments and/or tests per course do and that only sometimes correlates with credit hour allocation.  Some 2-3 hour courses will end up more intense and intellectually rigorous than 4-5 hour writing courses for instance.  Also, it is not an Asian thing.  It is an \"every frosh has been pre-primed to conflate credit hour number to rigor\" thing, so it is like 19 or 18 is some unlucky number when in reality your 15-17 hr schedule may be way rougher than most with 18-19. Would be more true for non-STEM folk where more courses are only 3 hours no matter the intensity.\n\n\\*I see you have Cafferty.  Eh..for actual life sciences majors (I recommend the best or richest 141/142 training possible, especially if NBB), but your schedule seems to accommodate it best.  If PACE and Hlth100 aren't solid and other sections are available, consider Abreu or O'Toole....but mainly Abreu if possible. No bio teachers are \"hard\" (I think they all pretty much write similar level tests and quizzes) at all, but I think some more so reflect what you'll experience in some NBB  cores and electives (even those hosted in bio, especially since QTM) and will do more interesting activities that make material more memorable or make you enjoy the course more.  If not, try to get someone else for 142.  142 material is more important for later courses.",

Many STEM classes are like that and receive no complaints.  I think many intermediate math courses at Emory have a history (I had physics and math major friends with similar backgrounds to you who complained of how weird it was that 221, 211, and 212 seemed unusually easy) of being surprisingly easy/straight-forward, so ratings may reflect that expectation (for example, Weinschenk has taught ochem at Emory for 20ish years.  People know what to expect by now). \n\nI'd say that later QTM courses probably build upon it in a way that pure math courses don't necessarily build on 211, so it may end up helping you. Who knows? Garcia in his first 5-10 ratings started off just like this and it looks like folks have warmed up to it since. \n\n If you have an advantage, you probably won't be hurt at all. Just expect not to make easy 90+ grades. But the point is that you don't need to to make an A.  Either way, you are totally allowed to go check it out for yourself!",

However, you have to think more strategically even about grades.  For instance, an \"easy\" STEM (all your QTM classes) course has test averages between 75 and 85 which still makes a B grade very likely even among those who claim to have experience and course is designed assuming experience AT EMORY, so for people who took 111/112 at Emory, and it seems they made those classes harder by installing real faculty in several sections).  If they assign projects or HW for a small portion of the grade, then you know they won't curve. Going into a curved (low mean tests) situation with the advantage of having had multi already may be safer.\n\nI would say take it into the account in the future.  Like when you choose BBA core/elective classes, if you choose an \"easy\" class, your grade is more up to luck because the grade is likely to be curved down (cut-offs increased above normal scale) to fit the distribution and the consequence of losing a single point can be unfairly amplified.  A medium or harder class will lower cut-offs and you can make more mistakes. \n\nFinally, note that math 210 is specifically for QTM people.  If they were gonna do AP/dual enrollment/HS level course, they would tell folks to do 112, 211, and 221 and not create a new course. I'm sure it will have some overlap with 112/BC and a barebones multi course, but it may have special emphasis that is better delivered by some than others.  You may find that you'd like to have Carr if he returns in spring. Either way, ride upward bound curves especially if you have an advantage (like prior knowledge).  Often \"easy\" STEM courses make Bs easy, but then put A/B separators on tests or find ways to catch even prepped folks off guard (like a surprisingly hard final to crash grades).  You get an 87-89 with them, you get a B+ whereas an 80-85 (or even high 70) in a class with a 60-70 average could still be an A/A-.",

The harder tests are more about whether or not you can think deeper/more conceptually to score better on 1-2 more challenging problems than others.

That way, I wouldn't be taking any classes I might not need the credit from in the future. I also tried to keep things relatively light in an effort to ease myself into college. 15-17 credits was what they suggested in the advisor meeting thing, I'm taking 16.  \n\n\nThoughts? Again, I didn't really feel particularly guided in this process, so input is greatly appreciated. Worth noting that I am going into business with hopes of focusing on CS to some degree.",
