I just got lucky with my classes being only on Tues and Thurs, so when I was done with them on Thursday, the \"weekend\" had started for me.\n\nYou get to decide your own schedule based on which classes and sections you want to take. I chose to have 3 classes on TTh only, whereas someone else might want MWF or M-Th (more balanced).",
