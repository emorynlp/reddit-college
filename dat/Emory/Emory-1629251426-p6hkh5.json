  "title:": "How to join EmoryUnplugged on Macbook",
  "text": "I\u2019m trying to join the EmoryUnplugged wifi on my Macbook, and it pulls up a page telling me to download an AntiVirus and a security agent. I downloaded both and tried to join the network again, and the same thing happened. What do I do?\n\nEdit: It looks like I got it to work. I clicked on both programs in my downloads folder, they did something (downloaded again?) and now the wifi seems to work.",
