Has anyone here taken it/ is taking it that could give a review of the class or send me the syllabus? \n\nI\u2019m also worried about Wyttenbach\u2019s rate my professor reviews - they say he\u2019s really quiet and I have terrible hearing but idk how credible the reviews are if he\u2019s gotten better  in recent years. \n\nThank you!",
