  "text": "Hi freshman here:)\n\nI have an English class from 4-5:15 on Ignatius Few Building, and then I have an online CS class at 5:30. I live in Complex so its impossible to come back to my dorm and take the online class. Are there any (relatively) quiet places near few hall where I take my online classes?",
