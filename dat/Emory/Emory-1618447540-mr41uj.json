I\u2019m a prospective c/o \u201825 freshman and would love to learn more about public health-related opportunities at emory :)",

      "text": "Honestly, to me it always looked like human health was for those pursuing alternative pathways associated with healthcare. It never seemed like it caught fire with the standard pre-health crowd (I've seen them take a couple of courses but most don't seem to major). The main non-STEM that always did that was anthro. and human bio.  \n\nLooks like HH has done well in being something quite a bit different beyond attracting pre-healths that may just want a slightly easier pathway (and maybe the capstone project requirement deters people.  That means you have to get something out of the major than just grades).  OP should have a large crowd to pull from as a non-premed human health isn't any sort of rareity.",

      "text": "Class of 2021 here\n\n1. Most of your classmates will be pre-meds and the courses themselves will be oriented around preparing them for clinical work and interfacing with patients, which notably is something that most public health people don't do. \n2. If you want to prepare for public health, learn how to code and get good at SPSS and RStudio. Again, most of the classes about literature and how to empathize with patients and whatnot are pretty useless for both your resume and actual practical skills you will need if you plan on doing any kind of research or working at an organization larger than 10 people. \n3.  Your classes will all share the same rotation of 5-10 guest lecturers. Email them ASAP so you can get into their labs before the others do. Undergrads work with professors from Rollins all the time. The current COVID-19 dashboard is being managed by a Rollins researcher and one undergrad. \n4. Going on study abroad helps immensely with getting into labs and generally getting on professors' good side. \n5. This is highly anecdotal/based on my personal experience so take it with a grain of salt but do NOT get into philosophy or sociology of any kind, it will make classes and assignments unnecessarily stressful and quite frankly nobody gives a rat's ass",
