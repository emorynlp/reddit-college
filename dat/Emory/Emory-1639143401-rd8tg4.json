Personally would recommend doing research in another university over the summer because Emory\u2019s summer research program isn\u2019t the best. If you\u2019re interested in getting a PhD there\u2019s a lot of stuff you can apply to that fully funds everything (room, board, etc.).",

                  "text": "I don't think this is fully true (or we need more specifics in terms of what is lacking and that answer is mainly just funding.  There is nothing wrong with the structure).  Most programs are VERY similar.  The major problem with Emory is that it can't fund enough students, and that the stipends are lower than some places, but there are still some peer universities without signficant formal summer research programs.  But the structure of Emory's is similar or a little bit more robust than others if only because it is attached to real mentoring (beyond just the P.I.) and usually requires writing a mini-proposal with the P.I. you choose which is an excellent experience especially if pre-grad or if you plan to apply for Goldwater, NSF Fellowships, NIH fellowships, Churchill, etc, or are MDPhD maybe.  And of course it has the classical symposium participation (I actually think Emory was among the first places to have a formal summer undergraduate research program.  The problem today is that the demand outstrips the funding which isn't the case of many peers), but it is still a great training oppurtunity (to see what is going on here, look into this: [http://college.emory.edu/main/docs/strategic-planning/AdHocURP.pdf](http://college.emory.edu/main/docs/strategic-planning/AdHocURP.pdf)).\n\nAside from the stipend, a fairer way to frame this would be to maybe argue that an REU type of experience helps you network at another school (whether it is similar to or significantly different from Emory, areas of research can be a small world and working with a good group elsewhere can pay dividends for your future) and thus establish a relationship with that school's faculty.  I've seen this pay off in terms of post-grad gap year and other oppurtunities such as medical school.  For example, admissions to UCSF for MD, MDPhD (or even getting an interview), and key life sciences PhD programs is extremely difficult even from top tier schools like Emory as well as the super elite tier schools, but I have seen people have done 2+ summer REUs there get admitted not only because they were great candidates on paper, but likely because they had insiders that could advocate for them based upon work done at the institution.",
