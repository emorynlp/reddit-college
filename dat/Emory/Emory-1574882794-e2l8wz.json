  "text": "I\u2019m considering switching to the $1100 Dooley plan this Spring and was wondering if I could buy groceries anywhere on-campus with it. I\u2019m planning to cook more and buy groceries instead of getting a swipe meal plan, because the unlimited plan costs too much, and the value plan seems like it would  not last me long enough. Besides, the DCT food is honestly garbage. With Dooley, I could spend money on food in Cox, the Emporium, and Kaldis, while trying to cook other meals for myself. I\u2019m hoping to spend significantly less on food in the spring.",

      "text": "You'd be better off just using Dooley dollars for Cox, Kaldis, etc and then ubering or taking shuttles to Publix or Kroger and using normal cash because any grocery items you can buy at the farmer's market or in Cox or in that place in the new student center is going to be so expensive",

          "text": "I have a car, so I can go grocery shopping easily. I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll cook my own dinners and breakfasts, while going to Cox for lunch and snacks in the day time. Hopefully I can spend less that 1500 total on food between Dooley and groceries. I might get a smaller Dooley plan in that case, since I\u2019ll likely spend more on groceries. Aldi is a good place for cheap groceries as well, but it is a little further. Thanks for the advice.",

      "text": "You can buy with dooley dollars at most of the booths at the Tuesday farmers market. Stop by next Tuesday and see if there\u2019s enough/variety of groceries you could actually buy at the farmer\u2019s market.  However, it\u2019s all organic and local so it is marked up. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d actually end up saving money groceries-wise.",
