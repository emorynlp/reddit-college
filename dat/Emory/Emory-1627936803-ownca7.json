      "text": "Honestly, if you felt like 17 was chill you should challenge yourself. People get too bogged down in the mindset of protecting their GPA but if you feel that you enjoy the classes, the work really kind of takes a back seat. Idk about some of the other classes you are taking but ECON 220 was challenging but an extremely worthwhile class, especially if you like/are interested in stats. Who are you planning on taking it with?",

      "text": "Okay so it really depends. For example, my worst semester by GPA was when I was taking 15 credits (4 real classes and TA credit and a 1 credit P/F class). My best semesters have been around 21 credits. People (students mostly) have told me I take too many classes and that might be true for them but not for me - I take a lot of classes, have a lot of involvements, and still have time for friends and myself. If you thrive when enrolled in a lot of credits then you should do what's best for you and ignore what others say. \n\nHowever, many people prefer or perform better with credit hours between 15-18. I'd recommend holding onto them all for A/D/S week and then seeing how the classes seem in terms of intensity. If it feels like too much, definitely drop a class then. If it seems manageable and you're confident in your ability to thrive and also have a personal life, then do it.",
