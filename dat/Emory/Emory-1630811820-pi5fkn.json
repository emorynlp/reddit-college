  "title:": "Advising Question: One Class Satisfying Two Requirements?",
  "text": "Quick Question, does one class taken satisfy two requirements? Like if I took a class that was listed under both requirements as a valid class, would it only apply to one, and then I would have to take an additional class, or would it apply to as many requirements as it can satisfy. I'm not sure how much my explination made sense. It wouldn't be for GER's, it would be major requirements. Like if I took CHEM 300L, which is listed under Analytical Lab and 300 level elective, would it count for both?",

      "text": "That's a CORE, not an elective so no it isn't an elective. It is NOT listed there.  They are using \"300\" to indicate the level of upper division labs you must take. On page 16 here, 300-L is not listed as an elective or 300 level lab:  http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/documents/undergraduate/Advising%20Support%20Guide%20Spring%202021.pdf\n\nThe 300 level labs are 2 in ADDITION to the core of 300-L (which I believe is a pre-req for most of them), and one needs to be writing intensive depending on whether you pursue a BA or BS I guess. Or are you under the old curriculum?  That is the only way this could possibly make sense and I thought those requirements disappeared for the last graduating class.",
