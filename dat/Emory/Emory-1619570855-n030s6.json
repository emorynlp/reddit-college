Wide range of ingredients alongside produce that\u2019s pretty cheap & often local. The building itself is a massive indoor market with so many choices you\u2019ll easily spend over an hour there.",

The comedy clubs seem really fun but I have only seen a couple shows at the Laughing Skull. And if you're willing to make the drive out, there's a bunch of nice hiking places in northern Georgia, personal favorite is Panther Creek Trail which is closed right now but hopefully is open by the fall. Also if Dragoncon is happening this year def worth a go. I think you'll find something you enjoy here soon enough!",

However, it would really serve you well to have some vehicle because the public transport system is garbage in its coverage and Emory is sort of isolated.",
