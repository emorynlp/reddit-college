      "text": "Cell biology is probably more useful for the MCAT (it'll blend the cell biology concepts in 141 with an in depth coverage of signaling covered in 142 and likely integrate  molecular genetics and different experiments that tells you how the cell works or result in applications), especially going based on the course description of that rendition of it so start with 250. Those people are new/in the FIRST fellows program so are really dedicated to teaching and likely receive mentoring from Dr. Eisen who typically teaches cell and epigenetics and is a top flight instructor.  The course is likely to be more research oriented and get you exposure to reading primary literature in cell biology which is good for when you start practicing MCAT passages because many passages in the biology/biochem, etc sections will focus on applications of cell biology and be derived from primary literature (including the data figures). View 250 as a strong reinforcement of biology 141 content with more depth which people who took Covid renditions of 141/142 really need based upon what I heard and saw (Again, 250 and 264 are like the big boy and girl versions of 141 and 142 and I think pre-meds and pre-grad life sciences folks who went through 141 and 142 last year or the previous year should take them).\n\nFritz is monotone as hell and the 223 course is usually just memorization (and there are a LOT of details, pathways and facts to memorize in 223 and AFAIK, the tests are not mostly multiple choice so you have to be knowledgeable enough to write and draw everything out that you got from the book or slides) and test based which isn't as MCAT relevant (on top of developmental not being a particularly high yield topic in terms of things where it may help if you got in depth exposure to). But I suppose you could switch into it (or better biol 264) if you don't like those 250 instructors, but I'm willing to bet that 250, even with the requirement of more critical thinking/problem solving (which many aren't used to in biology) may be less of a risk than 223 because they'll probably have an assignment or assignments that spread the total grade away from just tests and quizzes which will make for a nice cushion if an exam goes awry and that could be helpful if you are taking chem 203 (with either in person instructor, it isn't going to be easy at all).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Look for other answers on 223. Maybe Fritz has changed the format and style of cognitive demands for his class but I really doubt it.",
