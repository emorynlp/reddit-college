  "text": "Hi everyone!  \n\n\nI was recently accepted to Emory as a transfer student.  I was so excited to have been selected for admission, but I just realized that I will have to take out massive loans to attend.  I am from an upper middle class family, and my parents are choosing not to contribute anywhere near their EFC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs Emory worth it?  I am considering law school, but I am not sure. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current school is a non-Flagship state university in Illinois. Ranked 100-120 national universities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nContext:\n\n\\-My major is Philosophy, Politics, and Law.\n\n\\-I got into Duke out of high school, but I had the same issue.  Family couldn't pay the EFC, would've had to take out 150K+ in loans.\n\n\\-I currently have a full tuition scholarship at my school.  The only thing I have to take out loans for is cost of living (which will turn out to be around 30K total).  \n\n\\-I currently have a 4.0 here, and I haven't had to put in a tremendous amount of effort. I imagine that it is harder to get the same GPA at Emory.  Would excessive loans, a potentially lower GPA, but a nicer school be worth it?",

Stay away from debt at all costs (coming from someone who is still paying off Emory undergrad loans 8 years later)!",
