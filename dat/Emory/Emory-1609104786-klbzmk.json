  "title:": "Are Students Still Given a Free Windows 10 Product Key?",
  "text": "I definitely remember there being one provided in the past when I helped a friend build a new desktop and we had him log in to something (Emory's OnTheHub maybe?) to access his free key.  A search on this sub yielded no up-to-date information. [OnTheHub](https://emory.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=84d81ab5-bc38-dd11-abb7-0030485a6b08) only has a listing for faculty as of today.  Any information is much appreciated.\n\nThank you !!",
