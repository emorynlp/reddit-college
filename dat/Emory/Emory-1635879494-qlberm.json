  "text": "Hello! I am going to take biol 142 next semester. Cafferty and Spell's class times work best with how my schedule looks right now. I see quite a bit of support for Spell on here. In the case her class fills up before I can get to it, I would like to know what I would be in for in Cafferty's class. Also, generally, what are the pros and cons of both these professors?\n\nI am considering premed, but it's not set in stone. I am not a bio major, and chances are I will not become one. I am thinking of chemistry or applied math and statistics, so I will probably only take a few bio electives in the next few years to have a good foundation for med school and mcat (maybe 2 or 3 bio electives, and based on previous posts on here, I'll probably pick from 250, 264, 351 and 370 (+lab?) - side note, if I could only pick 2 or 3, which ones should I pick for later. Also side note- If I take chem electives related to biology (biochem, biophysical chemistry, the capstone - chem courses from the atlas over the past few years), would taking bio electives as such be needed?).\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Spell is unlikely to fill. Cafferty, Abreu will likely fill quickly.  You should try to take her whether you are entertaining future electives in bio or bio focused chem electives. It'll help.  Cafferty will be a nice humdrum experience with solid lecturing I guess but I wouldn't worry about getting Spell.  Hell Cafferty is so popular that he often overloads.",
