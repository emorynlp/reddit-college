  "title:": "I Just Realized I got an email for an alumni interview",
  "text": "My friends who are also applying to Emory were talking about their alumni interviews, and I was confused because I didnt have one, so I checked my email and sure enough it was there, I must have missed it because of other college spam emails. Does this mean I\u2019m screwed regarding my application?\n\nEdit: never mind, i panic read the email and it said that it didn\u2019t matter if I couldn\u2019t attend.",
