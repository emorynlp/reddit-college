Do you just wait in your shopping cart until it turns 12 and then click as fast as you can? \n\nAnything you guys can tell me about the actual experience would make me less stressed about the unknown.",

I don't know what major you're in but even strict course requirements such as CS with only two sections per every 200-level class, you'll get there in time. As a freshman, you'll mostly stick to 100-level classes although you can definitely branch out. But 100-level classes? They have plenty of slots.\n\n> But how fast do classes fill up? \n\nLanguage classes fill up the fastest and have the fewest slots per section. However, they just recently increased the amount of slots for some languages. Other classes that fill up fast are foundational courses for certain majors, but those have 75+ slots usually or have two sections.\n\n> How common is it to not get the classes you want?\n\nOnly happens if you literally do not plan ahead and/or keep switching classes last minute to waitlisted classes. Happens way less often as a sophomore+ since you'll already have an idea of how things run.\n\n> Do you just wait in your shopping cart until it turns 12 and then click as fast as you can?\n\nI do this only for really small and popular classes with a good timeslot. For most cases, your first enrollment period will be 8 hours and then the rest of them the next day or something. So I would join a class that has something like 10 slots. But even when I did that, they never filled up to maximum even after several hours of opening. So you'll have time.\n\nIt is highly dependent on which course you're looking at but I assure you, there'll always be something just as good or even better if you keep looking.",

You're done!\n\nThat's just for OPUS. My personal timewaster is scheduling myself out to 2-3 years out on a Word document. I like doing this for potential double majors. I am currently just an Anthropology/Human Biology major so I have plenty of options for major/double major requirements. I am also pre-health so I have some classes that *have* to be in there every semester.\n\nUse the schedule maker from Coursicle to match the times on Atlas and actually visualize your schedule to see if they fit well. I don't mind the oddball course schedule this semester with varied times because it's all online and I just stay off-campus anyway. Getting a more cohesive schedule is more important when we're back in-person.",

      "text": "Is course registration annoying? Absolutely. Can it be stressful? Possibly. Do you end up with the courses you want by the end of A/D/S? 99% of the time, yes you do. Log into OPUS 5-10 minutes before your registration time just in case anything is slow, and then just wait. At your registration time, just refresh, click all your classes, and hit enroll, and confirm. That\u2019s it! The registration itself takes about 45 seconds. If you don\u2019t get everything you want, take a deep breath and relax. A/D/S goes on for a while and you can usually get what you want. If the class you originally wanted is still full, look for another class you may not have considered! Last semester the sociology class I wanted was full, so I did some searching and found a Philosophy class (PHIL 116: Intro to bioethics) instead and it was great! So definitely make a few schedules with different combinations of classes/sections and you should be good to go. Only having 1 schedule is a bad idea because it is possible you\u2019ll get locked out of some of the classes. \n\nDon\u2019t stress too much. It seems scary but it\u2019s not so bad. Just don\u2019t freak out if you don\u2019t have your dream schedule right away, A/D/S is helpful. But be open to being flexible with your schedule! I know it\u2019s tempting to not want any classes before 10am, but sometimes you have to compromise a little :)",
