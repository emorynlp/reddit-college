  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI wanted to ship some packages to oxford and I was wondering how we input the address. I'm assuming we write \"Oxford College MSC #\" for the apartment number and the address as \"810 whatcoat street\". I tried to enter this address onto bed, bath, and beyond but once I click save to profile, the apartment number in which I wrote my MSC number does not save and I'm worried my items will get lost in the mail. The same thing happened to Walmart: it recognizes the 810 whatcoat street part, but says the address cannot be verified once I add my MSC number in the apt suite number area. Can we also return amazon packages at the mail center? Sorry if that's a dumb question, but I've always returned amazon packages at the specific return locations at Kohl's.\n\nIs there a limit to how many items I can ship? I'm from out of state so I plan to send a lot of items directly to campus from different stores like amazon, target, and bed bath and beyond.\n\nThank you!!",
