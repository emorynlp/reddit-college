  "text": "I am so happy to be matched to Emory. It was my first choice and I AM IN. I am planning on majoring in finance and I\u2019ve heard Emory has a good finance program. Can y\u2019all please tell me more about it?\n\nAlso, I\u2019m gay and haven\u2019t even had my first kiss yet. I wanna straight up ask if there are lots of gay ppl at Emory. The main reason I love Emory is that the city it\u2019s in is VERY gay friendly. I\u2019m excited.",
