          "text": "Yeah, but I don't know if the MCAT tests metabolism (at least the details of it so much as the logic) that intensely.  Wherever it does, based on practice I've seen, they spin it into an organic chemistry sort of thing or some experimental biochem oriented problem that focuses on the logic of the pathway (which they often give you.  In fact sometimes they'll probably throw pathways that biochem 1 courses don't cover). I would imagine there are some non-passage based/discrete questions that test the details of metabolism though, but in a way that can easily be reviewed by a Kaplain/prep book.\n\nI feel like a more problem solving and even structural bio oriented (along with some kinetics) focused biochem course and a much more balanced approach to signaling and metabolism is better for MCAT prep (just based on the materials I have), especially thinking of what I remember Kelly teaching and testing. Most people won't retain the stuff he taught(UNLESS it is right before or during MCAT prep in which case almost any old class would likely suffice) and probably won't develop enough problem solving skills to tackle harder passage based questions.  Kelly would only be good prep for discreets it seems.  He's a nice enough guy and sometimes lectures well/loves the signaling stuff but I don't think any of the biol biochem teachers have particularly useful renditions of it.  I think they teach it how they THINK the MCAT tests it which is only memory based (minus the kinetics module).  I also hope that Kelly started teaching the chromatography methods. I don't like Escobar, but at least he taught that.\n\n\\*Ironically, actual med school biochem may be more memory based than the MCAT so most undergrad metabolic classes are okay for that (as long as they emphasize diseased states and whatnot).  Just not the MCAT sadly.  Many people can (and have) easily do well on MCAT \"biochem\" without taking a metabolic biochem class.  I personally think an experimentally focused advanced/intermediate genetics and cell bio course is a better substitute if the aim is MCAT prep.",

The class is def very detail-oriented and most of that stuff won't be heavily covered. Good for learning about metabolism, but it's not a class specifically geared toward the MCAT. Graph interpretation and experimental techniques comprise a lot of the B/B section.\n\nMany medical schools are recommending/requiring biochemistry courses, so that's personally why I took it. I'd check with PHA and schools themselves to see if the other class can fulfill that requirement.",

                  "text": "Yeah your B/B performance could be because of a conglomerate of things because the MCAT's bio sections are highly interdisciplinary it seems.  You can probably get away without a bchem class IF you have a good cell or genetics course that emphasizes the skills you mention.  MCAT bio/biochem is NOT just biochem as people are taught in standard bchem.1 classes.  And bchem 1 classes are similar at most top tier and non-top tier schools. Only your HYPS lane and perhaps UCLA do it a bit differently.\n\nFrom what I have seen, most can get away with just taking bchem at the last minute some time prior to applying to med. school (most which blend bchem with physiology and disease state data). Kind of amazing that bchem classes haven't evolved to emphasize the MCAT skills. There are so many not so labor intensive ways to do it. One would think more Emory profs. would pivot towards it.",

                          "text": "Trust me it isn't important to academics either because we(I'm claiming it lol) go into niches where we \"eventually\" memorize the nitty gritty for our particular areas, but to understand other areas within the same field, we use Google and primary literature or reviews to learn or relearn it.  So these teachers are screwing over pre-grads and pre-meds at the same time whether the latter knows it or not (memorization is easier to most of us after k-12 so feels more comfy in the moment and profs bank on students just being able to figure out the MCAT on their own with no priming and many can but Emory is supposedly expensive because of the priming).\n\n I can tell you that in my first year of grad school they had to design courses to intentionally reorient most of us away from how we were taught and tested in undergrad because they knew we needed to know experimental design, data interpretation, etc just to get past prelim exams and 1st year cap stones which required us to write freaking NIH mock grants!  Teachers who emphasize those things at the UG level are helping most students who generally fall into the pre-grad or pre-med camp.\n\nI'm very anti the dev. bio class but I hear it usually has high exam averages like 336 so is naturally attractive to many even if Fritz the monotone is teaching it.\n\nEdit:  To be fair, I would say Emory has a higher share of professors and classes that emphasize the right skills (for those exams and other things students need) than many of its near peers, but students need to just actually bring themselves to take those usually less enrolled courses.  It looks like they had to basically convert many courses that weren't consistently that way by encouraging and training newer junior faculty to do that stuff. Examples are cell, evol, and genetics, and micro.  3/4 of these had one semester where only a memory focused prof. taught and then a research oriented prof. taught the next semester so you end up with 2 completely different renditions of the course depending on when you take. Micro only had Campbell and use your imagination for how that course works with her. Only the discussion section makes her version worth a single damn.  Vega is apparently all in on the better techniques so that's nice.  Sadly, dev. biology looks screwed because L'hernault rarely teaches it and I don't know if a junior faculty willing to teach it and change it will come in.",

Except that Bicoid regulates Caudal & Nanos regulates Hunchback.\n\nVega really emphasized data interpretation and critical thinking skills over rote memorization. The class was pretty helpful. Heard only bad things about Campbell's running of the microbio lab. People have mixed opinions about Koelle, but I felt that her discussion-centered learning style helped bolster my understanding of the content. O'Toole tries to hit the data interpretation bit also, but her class is disorganized and her ability to actually lecture is not there. The bio department really is hit or miss. The professor you select can have a huge impact on your class experience and what you take away. Also, the department as a whole is fairly disorganized. The chem department is much better in this regard. The core sequence \"weed out\" classes really make you work (I never put more effort into a class than Chem 203/203L and I still barely scraped by), but the chemistry curriculum is much more adapted and modernized. \n\nPart of it may be due to the nature of biology; biology really does have a lot of terms which you gotta learn & memorize. But there are definitely aspects of my undergrad experience which I felt were clouded by the frazzled nature of the department. Hell, even the buildings are wildly different -- 1462 Clifton Road looks like a bunker and the labs are pretty old, while Atwood is new and shiny with that atomic classroom.",

                                  "text": "Lemme ask this.  Is O'Toole still giving multiple choice exams? Because from what I heard, in her initial 240 offerings, she would give the little data interpretation based problems and worksheets for students to work on in class (I am thinking they are the ones Beck used) and then she'd give MCQ exams that stressed recall of details. It is so dumb and sends mixed messages about what students should take away and how they should study (if you send the message that your tests are stupid and memorization based on the first exam then students will de-emphasize trying to really understand the worksheets or p-sets after that because success on exams does not require them to).  Basically the assessments were misaligned with whatever learning goals she thinks she had and Beck never did that (to ensure students kept up with key details he just had reading quizzes that were MCQ, but the tests were pretty much new problems that were data and experiment focused).  I find that highly problematic which is why I just recommend people hold out for Beck if he plans to teach it.  \n\nI hear her version of 336 is technically the right direction to go in (relative to other profs which set sorry bars) but students of course don't like that because they want and expect only a recall/low level application focused physiology course (kind of like people have troped biochemistry as such so expect professors to go in that direction and get upset when they don't).  \n\nThe expectations game can play a huge role in how students receive (and thus what teachers deem worth doing) different course and assessment styles(chem is lucky because most students with common sense expect more problem solving from a chem course so are more open minded about what that looks like. Bio, most of us maybe up.until the AP exam which we were probably coached on, view it as ONLY a recall oriented subject because most k-12 teachers never demanded students do much with what they memorized) and sadly certain \"pre-med\" courses have a reputation or stereotype associated with them that students bring to college with them and sort of impose on instructors.  It doesn't help that most intro biol classes/sections at ECAS reinforce those stereotypes and expectations.  When they hit a critical thinking heavy course teaching and testing that same material, they just think \"hmmm this person is making me think too hard when we just needed to memorize it in 141 and 142. What is wrong with this teacher?\".\n\n\nAnd yes, infrastructurally chem and bio are just different. Like the grad and UG division are the same in that case so if the former brings in patent and research dollars, the latter can easily benefit. Biology is sort of a stand alone dept more similar to what you see at LACs.\n\nAlso my question is never really how MUCH a course makes you work, but how well(meaningful) it makes you work and THINK/develop skills under-developed in K-12 STEM for most(Emory students average well over a 1400 SAT, so can definitely do recall, MCQ exams, lower level applications, and algorithmic problem solving pretty well, especially when specifically coached for an exam that has all of this). If you don't use much beyond lower level cognitive skills here, then it is barely a college or Emory(insert any elite, because many more of them have this problem than should be the case) level STEM course (or at least isn't really appropriate for STEM majors):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy#:~:text=Bloom's%20taxonomy%20is%20a%20set,cognitive%2C%20affective%20and%20sensory%20domains.\n\nMy only exception to that idea is anatomy courses (because physiology CAN be very conceptual, interdisciplinary, and research based because it supposedly emphasizes systems anyway).",
