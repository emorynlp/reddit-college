I think it only kicks in if you take 6+ credits, and it ended up being like if you took 6 credits it would be less than if you only took 2 credits. Weird stuff.",

      "text": "I did a summer back when I went in the pre-historic ages and I regretted it because they skimp you on the financial aid severely (clearly the summer is a revenue raising effort).  Also, you should avoid taking certain STEM classes during summer as they aren't the same quality as during a regular semester (you lose professor selection AND they couldn't really go in as much depth if they would during a normal semester in the pre-med core courses).  If it isn't physics(this seems to be the exception in terms of content coverage depth and quality) or some bio/nbb electives like biochem or physiology (which aren't great during the semester either), animal behavior then I'd dodge it for quality control.  \n\nDefinitely don't do gchem, ochem, or gbiol (more MCAT important stuff I guess) during summer (plus you may wanna press your luck on in person versions of those which are much better than what people are likely getting now) as they are less likely to be good, and you are less likely to retain material because even if they push you less in terms of the content and level of problem solving/tests, it is still so fast that you may perform the same or worse than the semester course while also retaining far less.  Taking a couple of GERs may be worthwhile as well.",

If anything they may be a tad stronger in terms of expectations and level (because they give takehome exams over a decent amount of time and whatnot). Psych, no clue (generally I hear it isn't as great but it is a free grade!). Either way, you won't be disadvantaged in econ by taking a summer version",

I'd argue that far more effort goes into STEM options part of the marketing scheme that is the pre-college program than the actual summer courses.",
