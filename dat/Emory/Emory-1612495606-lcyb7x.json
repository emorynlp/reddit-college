      "text": "Hey! I am currently a junior in the program, switching/transferring to Tech in the fall. Overall I think the program is doable if you are organized. I am an Econ major at Emory (only 36 credits I think) and I think because it's one of the lower credit majors it has made it possibly easier to complete the Emory side of things. I have another friend (dual degree, also Econ major) who was a bit more organized than me and got out of Emory in 2.5 years instead of 3. If you can do this I highly recommend it, because as you may know Emory has changed the name of the \"3-2\" program to \"dual degree\" program because most students are not graduating in 5 years. Technically it is \"doable,\" but I've been playing around with a GT engineering schedule for next sem. and to graduate in 5 years I will need to take 18-20 credits a semester at Tech, which I think is too much for me because there are no float classes left, only hard engineering subjects (you take all the float/GERs here at Emory). So I will probably graduate in 5.5 years at the earliest, which is a long time :/ Thankfully I have parents who are able to support me but yeah it is kinda expensive when you consider you could also get a masters with the extra 1.5 years. But if you are in-state at GT then it would be less. I also have not \"wasted\" a single class at Emory, everything has gone to GERs, GaTech prereqs or my Econ major. I think you can get out in 2.5 years if you take a full load of summer school though, I only did a half load one summer. If you are interested:\n\n(Came in with 6 test credits, 3 went to the first GT English requirement.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFall Freshman:\n\nChem 1\n\nCalc 1\n\nRandom GERs\n\n(14 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpring Freshman:\n\nChem 2\n\nCalc 2\n\nRandom GERs\n\n(17 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummer:\n\n1 GER course\n\n(3 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFall Sophomore:\n\nPhys 1\n\nRandom GERs\n\n1 Econ class\n\n(16 Credits, I started Calc III but dropped)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpring Sophomore:\n\nPhys 2\n\nCalc III\n\nRandom GERs\n\n1 Econ Class\n\n(16 Credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummer:\n\nDif. Eq\n\nLinear Algebra\n\n(7 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFall Junior:\n\n4 Econ Classes\n\n2nd GaTech English Requirement (1st was test credit)\n\n(18 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpring Junior:\n\n4 Econ Classes\n\n(14 credits)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my case if I loaded up on more GERs the summer after my freshman year, and maybe took 2 more Econ classes the second summer, the 2.5 years would be possible. 2.5 years would be ideal I think just because it gives you more buffer to finish up at Tech. Also depending on your engineering preference they don't all require chemistry. For example I know Industrial doesn't. That could also make things easier. I personally think it has been tough but doable, I struggled in Physics my sophomore year (although physics has always been a weak point for me) and I kind of had to make sacrifices like \"no I'm not going to Orlando with my friends for fall break because I'm drowning in work\" and have somewhat limited the groups I am involved with on campus (for example I went to sorority rush but then realized I really didn't have time to join one) I am involved mainly in 2 music groups (1 gives me school credit) and besides that and a modest social life that's all I've really had time for. I hope I'm not complaining too much lol, I feel that in general Emory is not easy, but this has been my experience. It is a unique program though! And I don't think it will be around forever, pretty sure Emory hired the new president from UT because they are interested in starting an Engineering school at some point, they just lose too many applicants because they don't have one. I wish you the best of luck! Please feel free to message me if you have more questions:)",
