  "text": "Hi everyone! I'm a sophomore with a pretty easy courseload this semester, so I want to take an art class. All the ones I've looked at like artvis 105 seem to be full or really heavily waitlisted - does anyone know any fun classes where I can get my hands dirty? \n\nit could be painting, drawing, pottery, bonsai trimming, nail art. I really don't care, I just want something fun that I can swap into!",
