  "text": "Title. How does study abroad work? Do I take classes while I study abroad? I\u2019m assuming I can\u2019t take Emory classes right? So I should block out the semester that I\u2019m studying abroad? (I\u2019m an incoming sophomore ans gonna study abroad first semester junior year). Also random but I\u2019m going into the bschool so I\u2019m most likely going to be recruiting junior year second semester, would studying abroad first semester junior year be bad for recruiting? Because I would just be taking two concentration classes second semester junior year. Also I want to study abroad in China - are there good business related classes during that? Do I even take classes while I study abroad? Or do I just hang out in China lol? Sorry for all the questions",

      "text": "Yes studying abroad for first semester jr year would be pretty bad for recruiting, particularly if you are finance or consulting as thats when the majority of recruiting happens. Although banking has moved up into summer as well. You wouldn\u2019t be able to go to super days and scheduling interviews would be difficult.\n\nAlso, speak to the bschool advising office, but I think there\u2019s limitations to where bschool students can study abroad because not all schools offer equivalent bschool classes(I could be wrong), so you would fall behind. Also there\u2019s a strategy if you want to take hard bschool classes to take them abroad because its way easier grading.",

          "text": "Is that thing about grading as straight-forward as you make it? I feel like many universities abroad (at least ones that GBS would allow credit from fall more in line with this description of UK academics, and from what I've seen, it's true for STEM and more quantitative subjects:\n\n[http://abroad.emory.edu/\\_customtags/ct\\_FileRetrieve.cfm?File\\_ID=03057274704F0A007705750704071C04080C0014757800006E060375767D72040F0601017B7B037202](http://abroad.emory.edu/_customtags/ct_FileRetrieve.cfm?File_ID=03057274704F0A007705750704071C04080C0014757800006E060375767D72040F0601017B7B037202)\n\nUnlike many U.S. STEM and quantitative courses, based on what I have seen, I don't think they are trying to just ask students to regurgitate or recite(they expect much more extrapolation and derivation on average) problem types they've already practiced or seen in class so the raw averages tend to be lower and I think Emory takes that into account.  I don't know if I'd characterize it as \"easier\" grading.\n\nMost people at Emory avoid STEM and quant instructors who make assessments (whether you talk a high stakes exam, a problem set, or project) like a lot of these euro folks even if they know the final grade distribution will end up identical to the teacher who does just ask them to sort of repeat such that their course averages are always nicely in the 80s for example.  I think it is just different.  Like in grade translation memos for places like St. Andrews in Scotland, Emory is converting a 70 to a B- so something is up and I suspect that is because the median or average student in most cases at such places is earning around a 70-80(and not just because they suck more than the average Emory student lol) and not 80-90 like most of the similar classes outside of the HYPS crew of schools (who also tend to design their assessments to be on the more challenging side but may have a bunch of low stakes stuff to buffer grades and get them in \"normal\" U.S. raw score ranges).",
