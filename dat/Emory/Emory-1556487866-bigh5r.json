I feel like this subreddit has lots of potential but we're letting it rot.\n\nEDIT: is there any way we can get it from them without them handing it over since they're so inactive?  \nEDIT2: have requested on r/redditrequest pls upvote the post so it gets traction \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/bih3z1/requesting_remory_because_the_moderators_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app",
