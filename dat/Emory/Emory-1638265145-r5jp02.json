  "text": "Hi. I'm a high school senior and I'm most likely gonna apply to Emory. I just wanted to ask whether Greek life is prominent at Emory. I personally don't like Greek life and won't be participating so I wonder if fraternities and sororities control the social scene. Are there ways to have fun without being involved with Greek life? Thank you!",

      "text": "Emory is only about 24% Greek and typically run events Thursday through Saturday night. They are not in any way *the* social scene here, and only exist to entertain themselves. In other words, they exist, but are not large, required, or even worth noticing. If you're wondering about how to have fun on campus, it pretty much depends on if you find a group. In a similar manner to Greek life, each other group on campus is small, but close-knit. Emory is cliquish, and student clubs rarely have social/fun events, most don't even have general body membership (a by-product of the pre-professionalism that Emory has not been able to get away from since the 20s and GIs). That said, no matter the kind of fun you're looking for, you'll be able to find it people for it. There are groups that play smash on Fridays, there are groups that make nightly trips to Atlanta, and there are groups that play card games in their dorm rooms; you just have to find a group.",
