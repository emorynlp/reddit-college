      "text": "from my experience, it's a group meeting. They have few students (probs like 4-5) in zoom and introduce themselves to each other. Then the oue advisor talks about gres, ap scores, and advice for pre-meds/business/law students. Then there will be a quick q&a session (if anyone has questions about registration or school life). Honestly, there's nothing to prepare unless you have questions about registration!",
