  "text": "Hi!! I'm so excited about my acceptance to emory and I was just wondering how the dorms and res life are at both emory college and oxford. Which ones are the \"worst\" and which buildings tend to have more social activities, more people, better reviews, etc? Not that this is what I'm gonna base my decision on, but dorming seems so fun and I'm just excited to see how it works on both campuses :)\n\nAlso any tips on what to bring and what not to bring to college or filling out housing info? What's something you wish you knew before coming to emory?",

      "text": "All the dorms near the center of campus (LSM, Raoul, Few, Evans, Hamilton) are great. Modern and newer. Harris and Complex are very meh. Far away from student center and freshman life stuff, but still only like a 7 min walk. They're both close to academic buildings and right next to the business school though. Dobbs is kinda known as the shitty dorm, but I've heard that people bond over living there if that's any solstice. I'm in harris and personally don't have any complaints, except that it would be nice to be a bit closer to things. Can't really go wrong tbh (unless you get dobbs) lmao",

      "text": "main campus student here: i would say dobbs and complex are generally considered \u201cworse\u201d (dobbs is small & has no elevators, complex is far away from freshman life) and raoul and LSM are seen as \u201cbetter\u201d (newer, big floors, lots of people, modern). i am a current turman resident and i really like the vibe of the smaller floors w/ nice big rooms, and the communities in hamilton and turman are both pretty tight-knit in my\nexperience. honestly it\u2019s largely about who you\u2019re near, who your roommate is, & who your RA is tho, and also even the \u201cbad\u201d options have plenty of other schools beat and have their own charms. just ask somgfest lol. every hall is gonna have its own social activities and it mostly depends on your RAs in that regard imo.",

      "text": "Raoul, LSM, Hamilton, and Turman are all really nice and modern, and also have a great location on the first-year quad! Usually first year RAs do a great job of building a community on your floor, I know a ton of my hallmates became good friends of mine. \n\nAs for what to bring/what not to bring just normal residence hall stuff. They\u2019ll give you the option to rent a microfridge. If you have the ability to store a mini fridge over the summer, I would definitely recommend that instead, way better deal than renting (essentially renting for one year ends up being the same cost as buying one yourself).",

      "text": "I can speak for Oxford and Clairmont (upper classmen housing)\n\nOxford:\n\nFleming: the best and newest building. Has a common area with a pool table and TV + games where you will often find people hanging out in the evenings. The public bathrooms nice bc you get a lot of showers but the water pressure feels like someone is peeing on you. WHY. I'd sacrifice that Pete Davidson Q&A to fix the showers in Fleming.\n\nElizer/Murdy: similar to Fleming and alot of people hangout here, but it's slightly older and the furthest away from the other buildings on campus. Beware the non gendered bathrooms\n\nJRC: the worst quality housing.. if you have asthma or allergies to mold you will need to move out. Only upside is it's in a great location in the middle of campus.\n\nHaygood: cozy but kind of moldy like JRC. Honestly a solid choice although people have mixed opinions. Showers here spray like a freaking hose it is glorious. It's the closest to the forest trails.\n\nOff campus housing is not a thing at Oxford\n\nOverall ranking: Fleming > Elizer/Murdy or Haygood > sleeping in a crevice in the underground tunnels > JRC. (Yes there are secret underground tunnels under Oxford)\n\nClairmont\n\nCRC is great. You can have doubles or triples with your own bedroom and bathroom. It just feels like the newest and most comfortable. You'll have the most amount of personal space at CRC.\n\nURC is also great and very similar to CRC, but if I'm not mistaken you can only do quads in URC which means you have your own bedroom but share the same bathroom.\n\nTowers is the worst option. It is a literal tower which is great if you have a balcony room, but there is only one elevator that breaks down sometimes (this also makes move in/move out days a pain). If you get a triple or higher in Towers, you will share a bedroom with someone else :/ it's not terrible, but try to avoid Towers.\n\nThere are plenty of off campus housing options like Clairmont Reserve and Clairmont Point and I hear they are good, but I was on campus so I'm not the person to ask.\n\nOverall: CRC > URC > Towers",

I\u2019m so helpful :) I\u2019m curious about your experience at Oxford, did u ever feel like you \u201cmissed out\u201d on things ECAS people had/did and would you pick Emory Oxford again if given the choice?

              "text": "Yeah I definitely felt like I missed out on cool things to do on and around the ATL campus (although it isn't a big deal to me bc i live 30 minutes away from ATL lol). I also missed out on ECs that I could have maintained for 3-4 years. I also really enjoyed the gym at ECAS. Oxford has less options for city life, ECs, and facilities, but it is a smaller campus in a rural area, so that is expected.\n\nThe strengths of Oxford are more about the sense of community and relationships you form with the people around you, including faculty. It is much easier to have high quality friendships at Oxford because at ECAS, it feels like everyone is so busy and too stressed to hangout. I think it's because of the nature of small campus vs large campus. I had a really good relationship to my advisor, my research PI, multiple professors, and even the director of RES life Dr. Hempfling. The faculty at Oxford is so involved with their students that they are able to form amazing relationships (and write amazing recs). Also, even though ECAS has more options for ECs, city life, and facilities, Oxford provides enough ECs and facilities to support a small campus, so you can still have high equality ECs at Oxford and the facilities are still really good compared to alot of colleges.\n\nYes, I would 100% pick Oxford again. If you would like to read more details about the pros and cons of Oxford, check my post history I made a long post on it.\n\nThe history of the secret tunnels runs back to the Civil War when Oxford college was converted into a temporary Civil War clinic. They dug tunnels underneath campus for the soldiers, and they are still there on campus. Rumor has it that the secret societies of Oxford meet under the tunnels to do God knows what, probably just one of their weird Dooley rituals. There are two rumored entrances to the tunnels that I know of: find the door in the alleyway behind the church that says \"KEEP OUT\". The other one is behind Candler and it's this massive crypt door behind some fences. It's not so clear how to enter the tunnels, that's the part I didn't figure out, but maybe you could find out and tell me lol.",
