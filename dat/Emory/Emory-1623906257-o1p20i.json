  "text": "Hey y'all! I was a soph transfer and was SUPER worried on trying to get good profs for some classes I'm taking on campus next semester. I noticed that a lot of the classes closed at ridiculously small amounts of people, and was wondering if they're really just that small, or the admin is trying to finesse us. How worried should I be about trying to get good professors for the gen eds? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hi! Also a sophomore here. Course registration was horrible for everyone. \n\nAs for \u201cgood professors,\u201d it really depends on which general ed reqs you\u2019re talking about. If it\u2019s math, you\u2019re not getting a good professor. If it\u2019s something like anthro 101, it doesn\u2019t matter too much. \n\nOverall, you shouldn\u2019t be too worried. At least, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re going to open more sections, or else me and a lot of people I know are pretty screwed.",

          "text": "If it is typically freshman filled classes, y'all will be alright because they typically just scaffold the registration to block spots off for them until A/D/S but I do have this feeling that Emory is maybe suffering from higher enrollment that it isn't fit to handle (classroom size and scheduling, faculty commitment. It just has never fit itself to do many very large lectures like its peers which is a double edge sword I guess). it is reaching to handle due to a high number of deferrals and stuff last year. Y'all might wanna buckle up for a competitive year for multi-section classes with varied quality and style across professor. Even intermediates may be affected by gap years taken by sophomores and upper classmen. You never know.",

                  "text": "Yeah but are you talking 170 or intermediates and upper divisions? Looks like 170 can easily expand because the lecture is online.  Higher level in persons may be a problem if that is the case.  For example, for pre-meds and chem majors, there is about to be a serious problem with \"orgo\" as both instructors throughout both lectures have large waitlists (talking like 80 for one of Heemstra's sections and maybe 30-40 for one of Weinschenk's). If I had to guess, some departments are gonna end up begging another faculty to teach a core or even drag someone from another institution over.",

I just mentioned the chem situation and was curious so checked and they just significantly raised Heemstra's enrollment because he was already assigned an auditorium sized classroom.  Usually they want to keep these intermediates as small as they can at Emory(vs. peers of similar undergrad populations) to preserve quality and increase possible student-teacher engagement, but I guess they'll (and y'all IF you actually value interaction vs. sort of hiding, listening, and passively taking notes) have to deal this year.  I hope that CS department can manage to deal with the demand as well (I know they were supposed to have some new hires?).",
