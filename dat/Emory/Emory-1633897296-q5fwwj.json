  "title:": "Seeking Wheelchair Users to Participate in Georgia Tech Research Study",
  "text": "The Rehabilitation Engineering and Applied Research (REAR) Lab is looking for participants to help us with one of our ongoing studies! Our lab focuses on the research and development of technologies aimed at helping those with disabilities. For this project, we are using pressure mats to measure information about the participant's posture while they are seated on a wheelchair cushion. Eligible participants must be:\n\n1. A current wheelchair user\n\n2. Aged 18 years or older\n\n3. Able to transfer on and off their chair independently\n\nParticipating in this study involves a two visits to our lab at Georgia Tech's campus. During the first visit, which will last 60-120 minutes, we would have you transfer off your chair, attach the weight shift sensor underneath your cushion, place a pressure mat on top of the cushion, and have you transfer back to your chair. During the study, you may be asked to move in your chair and shift your weight at various times. Then you would go home with a sensor inside your wheelchair cushion cover, below your cushion that will measure your weight shifts during everyday life. In 1-2 weeks you would come back to Georgia Tech for a short visit to have the sensor removed.\n\nAs a thank-you for participating, we will send you a $40 gift card. Please reply to this message or email rearlabgatech@gmail.com for more information!\n\nMore info on our lab is available at http://rearlab.gatech.edu/ if you are curious about what we do.",
