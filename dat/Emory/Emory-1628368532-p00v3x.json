I hear it is super interesting (top faculty lecture and teach history as it is actually done vs. A collection of facts and is fairly low work load overall). Also I would just try to get into O'Toole unless she is the same time as McGill. Not perfect but more serious about students learning bio at the right level and maybe tries a tad harder than Abreu for whose section 5 only has 12 spots left.  Your schedule would be so light even with an extra 3 (that is simple) that you don't need the absolute easiest bio instructor to position.yourself to do well grade wise. Really none of these people are what you would consider truly \"difficult\" anyway if only because the topics for 141 are kind of basic and aren't amenable to challenging assessments until maybe mid way through or near the end of the course and those last 2 or so modules are perhaps the most useful anyway.\n\nHaving the best possible foundation in chem and bio is just really important as a future NBB major (which beyond NBB 201 is a lot more problem solving and systems/experimental thinking than pure memorization.  Take bio and chem.people more serious about building that and exposing you to a little complexity in terms of HW, assessments, etc so that classes like NBB 301 don't have to be much of an adjustment in terms of how to properly learn biology).  I won't even bring the MCAT into it like I usually do because that usually convinces no one.",

Plus I only see bio and math here.  You can probably find a more relaxed course or even exchange math with CS 170 just to see how much you like it.  But with this schedule I would hope 17-18 is doable as long as the last class isn't a killer. Again, it won't hurt to find a nice buffer class in case something as intensive as bio becomes a problem.  Some classes are intensive no matter how many or little hours you take and you may wanna keep the withdrawal option on the table for such a course. Either way this schedule is fine and you can probably afford a less intensive 2-3 hour course.",

It just seems like Emory's neuro major may be set up different than wherever you came from.  I mean as long as you came from a more selective or at least rigorous program you'll be fine but this schedule looks crowded. Also be warned that folks with 301 done may have an advantage in 302.",

And yes, I think it would make sense to maybe move 302, but again, I still don't know how this will work.  What basic foundational sciences do you have left before you can take 301 (I ask because I see 141-L on  your schedule)? I'm just thinking long term and how the hell you're gonna graduate next year (unless you have a little time to spare.  That's certainly fine and may be a decent idea to get more out of Emory to make a transfer worthwhile).  Because 401 is only offered in fall (unless you do the study abroad 402 thing) and requires both 301 and 302 beforehand. Both 301 and 302 are offered every semester fortunately (and honestly, I kind of recommend Frenzel's spring rendition as it builds skills that help you read the papers in NBB 401).  The hierarchical nature of these core classes makes NBB one of the less transfer friendly programs at Emory IMO.  And chem can be a little painful too so hopefully those credits cleared if you had them.",

Okay, looking at this, I'm wondering if you should just suck 302 up (another option would be Maymester 302). Others may be advantaged but maybe your previous courses will help avoid that and then you can just do Frenzel's class in the spring.  You may want to fit in physics so that physics 2 aligns with 301 but you don't really have to if you are willing to self teach",
