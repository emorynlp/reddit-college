One of the classes for my major has 77 of 120 available and the class for my minor only has 4 available so should I validate the class for my minor first?\nThanks",

      "text": "This depends on how popular those classes are. Would it be more likely those 43 seats get filled, or those 4 seats? If those 43 were like bio 141 vs 4 seats in art history, I\u2019d worry about bio. Hope this example makes sense. Also consider which class would have people drop/swap more.",
