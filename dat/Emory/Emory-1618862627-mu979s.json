  "text": "I'll be coming to Emory in the fall as a grad student and am working on lining up housing. I have tours scheduled at the following places: Cortland, Decatur Highlands, Rock Springs Village, Clairmont Reserve, and Calibre Woods. Does anyone have thoughts on any of these places or suggestions for similar places? I'm looking at 1BR in the roughly $1400 range. Distance is not a huge concern. Thanks in advance, I'm excited to join the Emory community!",

It is a beautiful community, lots of trees and and privacy. Its also right next to toco hills which has a krogers, publix and restaurants. Would definetly recommend!",

      "text": "I feel like highlands and reserve are known for being more fairly priced but not quite as \u201cboujee\u201d. I live at reserve and am cool with it... I\u2019d do it again tbh. Both of these have a good mix of undergrad, grad and young professionals.  Highlands has more undergrad population/community. Cortland properties are generally well run but sometimes pricey. I know The other two properties but not that  well. I think if you\u2019re gonna be commuting you have to kind of consider what\u2019s the closest to your buildings on campus. During peak rush hour on weeknights... it\u2019s almost quicker to walk to the Emory shuttle from Clairmont reserve or highlands to get to main campus (rather than dealing with rush hour traffic).",
