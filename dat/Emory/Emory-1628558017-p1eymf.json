Elite southern universities like Duke, Emory, Rice, WashU, UVA are very liberal. Emory is as liberal if not more than all of its northern counterparts. One could even say it\u2019s liberal to a fault. Heck Emory\u2019s student body is like very northern. The most represented state is New York. Also Emory is more diverse than pretty much all other similarly elite schools especially when it comes to African Americans. Also according to this years data there are more Asians than Whites in the student body so the validity of the term PWI is questionable",

Socioeconomically, Asians are effectively white (despite facing discrimination by certain white individuals verys similarly to how other now white groups did and probably still do to some extent) in the U.S. context so Emory IS still a PWI for all intensive purposes.  There is no tie that binds \"POC\" especially when groups have different histories and now a different social standing in the country.",

It\u2019s true that certain socioeconomic and demographic measures, such as aggregate income and education levels, suggest that on average Asian Americans are among the most successful in the United States. However, many Asian American ethnic groups represent populations experiencing stark economic inequalities. These limited economic metrics are not the only measures of racial marginalization. Asian Americans continue to experience discrimination, hate crimes and racial violence, xenophobia, concerning levels of racial/ethnic bullying in schools, and other indicators of racial marginalization in the U.S.   \nLook too quickly, and you might think that Asian Americans are not directly affected by racism. However, Asian Americans report experiencing racial/ethnic discrimination at about the same frequency as African Americans. Even though anti-Asian racism is not the same as anti-Black racism, both types of racism still reinforce and result from structures of white dominance. Systemic white supremacy affects different populations in different ways.\n\nJust recently there was a shooting in an Atlanta area massage parlor...the victims were predominantly Asian...you can't ignore the racial component of that crime.",

                  "text": "Well even \"brown\" Hispanics and Latinos in the U.S. are marking white in significant numbers today because Hispanic or Latino is simply not a race.  Even many Latin countries in the Caribbean have strange rules with regards to who counts as what race.  Anyone downvoting this does not get how race works and has evolved in the U.S.  They are still stuck on \"white\" as this special skin tone or phenotype associated with oppression which is not what it's about in the U.S. at all and people should do the research on how this works. Hell, maybe they can use their Emory coursework to learn about it.  But it is so obviously a socioeconomic and sociopolitical designation that anyone who isn't black can aspire to and the history of who counted as white (which often changed via legislation. Like when Irish and Italians were allowed to get FHA loans, that basically finalized their invitation into it) and who went to courts to be considered as such shows it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, I invite y'all to think of this race stuff in a nuanced way. A pre-dominantly Asian and white school is still a PWI and operates just like one.  If Asians were still a systemically oppressed group (like...if most were \"Pacific Islanders\", we'd be having a different discussion), we could be having a different conversation and I imagine most PWIs would operate differently if it had an ultra high % of students and faculty who were marginalized, but that isn't how this works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you described in that shooting is an awful event and an interpersonal example of racism and should NOT be conflated with systemic racism. Jewish people are white and get a lot of that type of discrimination.  Most people (even blacks, and I am one) do not experience life at the mercy of an individual racist.  That is not how it works.  You can't flatten these conversations by saying \"this group that has successfully accessed wealth and most of the advantages of America, but is not white or is more like a marginalized group because certain individuals don't like them and do awful things to them in person\". It just doesn't make sense.",

                  "text": "Yeah that (external labelling) doesn't matter.  Again, many indigenous and mixed Hispanics that are marginalized mark white in the U.S. and there are cases where BLACK north Africans with Arab names are advised to take advantage of Arabs being counted as white in the census by marking white on demographic forms (look these articles up).  \"Whiteness\" is something to aspire to socioeconomically (and has little to with interpersonal experiences with racism or whatever and more so your relative position in a broader system).  And groups have lobbied to be counted and not be counted as such for a variety of reasons at different points in time in the U.S.\n\nWhat matters is access and proximity to white institutions and wealth so that is a very reductionist assessment to just lump in everyone in who may experience some type of interpersonal racism as a \"colored person\". That's not how this thing works and the construction of race in the U.S. is highly controversial because of how it has shifted over time with regards to different groups being elevated (or being selected through immigration policy) and whatnot.  You have groups like Arabs who largely are considered white in the census but face more systemic discrimination and surveillance than many Asian groups:\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-census-middle-east-north-africa-race/)\n\nThis article shows how race and identifying with whiteness is more political than anything else. And accessing what the U.S. has to offer is about wealth attainment.  Any group that can attain as much wealth as the \"legacy\" whites with the phenotype we think of is effectively white (again certain groups who officially count as white today experienced a LOT of discimination upon immigrating here.  And you have Jewish people who still get their own special for of it, though it isn't largely systemic anymore).  This whole race thing in the U.S. is not as clear as people want it to be (largely because it's a con).  Even self-labeling changes over time.  The Hispanic designation arose out of politics done by those in that growing community and people should look into that as well to understand what contexts may cause it to be disadvantageous to identify as white (as the Hispanic label didn't exist as an ethnic group for quite a while in the U.S. Other than Afro-Latinos and Latinas, they were white regardless of skin tone  and interpersonal discrimination and in fact, during Jim Crow in many southern states, they could go to white schools), something else, or as a distinct group with specific needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat you described in that shooting is an awful event and an interpersonal example of racism and should NOT be conflated with systemic racism. Jewish people are white and get a lot of that type of discrimination.  Most people (even blacks, and I am one) do not experience most of life (though sadly blacks maybe too often if you talk police, but those are ultimately agents of the state and not private citizens) at the mercy of an individual racist.  That is not how it works.  You can't flatten these conversations by saying \"this group that has successfully accessed wealth and most of the advantages of America, but is not white or is more like a marginalized group because certain individuals don't like them and do awful things to them in person from time to time\". It just doesn't make sense and people should stop reducing race and racial solidarity (and lackthereof) as the quality of interpersonal interactions with other racial groups.  That can have consequences but the issues are so much bigger than that and come down mostly to who policy is constructed for and against and the long term affects that has on a community fully accessing American citizenship.  Someone could shout a racial slur at me today and I'd be very upset or a white person could say: \"I really like black people\" (or whatever) and I may smile, but it wouldn't change my position at the bottom like say...failed reconstruction and exclusion of my ancestors from many of the New Deal policies, or the many policies that did my community harm in the contemporary era all of which has damned near locked us out of wealth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, downvote away.  Prove me wrong that Emory doesn't operate like a standard PWI because it has a lot of Asians and a decent proportion  of URMs versus a few peers.\n\nBefore using that article, think of a larger context and history that is the U.S., and make your own assessment about the article.  Don't just agree with the answer they provide.  Critique it and think it through.  If you notice them conflating interpersonal racism with systemic, think about that type of thing.  An interesting conversation about some Asian groups is how some have a very large wealth gap within them and the more disadvantaged folks get over-looked or ignored to the detriment of that slice but perhaps to the betterment of that group generally (like in the U.S., having your oppression or downtrodden status covered in media or highlighted often gets used against you if you don't or can't effectively advocate for your group in political spaces.  Instead of designing helpful policy, people may pathologize your group or fearmonger and all types of stuff) or even a discussion on how \"Asian\" should perhaps be disaggregated to highlight different origins is more worth while.  However, the data on wealth of most of these groups just doesn't lie.",

                          "text": "I know the history. I am talking about positionality now. And there is a lot of \"anti-whatever\".  Also throwing articles is insufficient.  Either you want to engage the article and agree with its framing on everything or you don't. This isn't sufficient evidence to refute the idea that some groups, including many Asians have achieved the most meaningful aspects of whiteness in the American context.  Until these things and more policies affect a groups' wealth position so that it differs dramatically (negatively) from \"white\"(which is a big blob including a lot of technically non-white people), the group is effectively white. This isn't about individuals.\n\nAnd what is being defined anti-Asian racism has nothing to do with their relative access to white institutions TODAY.  They can experience mental health effects and all of that but still be relatively white in terms of what defines Americaness and the American dream and American citizenship.  These things have not prevented them collectively from achieving that.  As annoying and awful interpersonal racism is it just isn't the same as systemic racism. \n\n If Asians start to get redlined out of white neighborhoods or cause home values in a neighborhood to decrease substantially once they exceed a certain threshold in it then we can have a serious conversation because right now you are just throwing out how INDIVIDUALS experience certain things versus positioning of a certain collective in a bigger system. When you do that we'd have to strip Jewish people and maybe many others from their whiteness.   What you're basically doing is an \"well everybody goes through stuff\" argument and it's kind of offensive to me when people flatten oppression like that. What does it mean if \"we all go through things individually and aren't treated like a WASP\" if some of those groups going through things are basically locked out of WASP level wealth and some aren't? I'm just sayin'.\n\nI could post some articles about anti-semitism in the U.S. and how awful that is but they are still white.  Could have done the same with Irish and Italian Immigrants for a while even after they were officially considered white.\n\nHere start with wikipedia which also has its flaws but walks you through court cases that demonstrate how some groups, and individuals were trying to access whiteness (and sometimes even did) through the courts.  And I am sure many were \"brown\" and had different phenotypes, but everyone knows that whiteness in the U.S. tracks with having full access to citizenship (and this shows up in these many court cases you'll see mentioned) and access to certain policy benefits and institutions that may be wealth generating. Before now, you'll see how whiteness was almost directly tied to naturalization and citizenship (and how arbitrary some of this stuff was). Today this has morphed into something else as full citizenship is basically who easily can access wealth and white institutions and who can't.  Those who can't have a sort of fractional citizenship in this country (naturalized or not. Born here or not).  Again not just about phenotypes and skin colors anymore (was barely about that in the 18-1900s. It has always been a sort of political category that was manipulated in strange ways). It's a contrived category that mainly means \"full access to the best of America\" and it will expand again:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States",

I am saying it is NOT the same and it just isn't and it isn't the same magnitude and nor is it CURRENTLY having the same  effects on many Asian groups (\"Asian\" is vague.  Like Hispanics and Latinos, this should be disaggregated because different origins confer at least slightly different, if not very specific statuses in the U.S.) as it is on certain other marginalized groups and that has to do with lineage and how policy worked in this country and each groups relationship with it historically and now.  And those articles you sent are not emphasizing POLICY and access to wealth and the benefits of American citizenship so they are not as relevant in a conversation about whiteness.\n\nYou need to look into how fluid whiteness is and has been in the U.S. and how it has been legislated by courts (and by who can benefit from whatever government policy and who couldn't and how those decisions of inclusion/exclusion were made) and has how proximity to it and full access to it correlates with wealth and the full benefits of this country.   This has nothing to do about my, your, or anyone's feelings and mental health.  That is not the main effect of race in America.  Race in America is not only about interpersonal interactions and micro-agressions. It is about who can access what.  Most Asian groups are effectively white in terms of what they can access as a cohort.  If you want to be specific about which groups tend to experience what type of discrimination, that's fine, but as a cohort, the larger groups have white (or better) wealth.  They would be more akin to Jewish whites in terms of the type of discrimination you discribe.  If you want me to be nice, I'll call most Asian nationalities and maybe Arabs within the U.S. \"off-white\".  Race is about hierarchy and not whether a group is fully free from certain types of discimination.  Not even all \"whites\" are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince you clearly don't understand how race is a part of a larger system that goes beyond treatment between individuals and \"feelings\", start with wikipedia:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions\\_of\\_whiteness\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_whiteness_in_the_United_States)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can disagree, but you should understand the complexities of race in this country and how it is about how groups are generally treated as a collective and it requires specificity to discuss it. Any group currently positioned well to access white institutions has been essentially made white. A lived experience/interpersonal interactions due to a phenotype can be very important and have mental health effects, but imagine having all that and being basically locked out of true socioeconomic mobility as a group via bad (and targeted) POLICY from the government and not just individuals who didn't particularly care for you or straight up hated you.  That has generations of \"not so good\" effects on a whole group of people to have policy that has ultimately made a group sort of a contagion to wealth.  \"Some experience job discrimination\" just doesn't cut it in a conversation about whiteness (because I can find poor whites in appalachia or something who may experience that.  Or a Jewish who might) if the collective of a group has a very high median(so not even average which could result from skewing at the very top) wealth level, high than whites.",

      "text": "Regardless of what happens at Emory, at least you'll be in the freaking Atlanta area (and in a county with a lot of black people).  Honestly, being in a large southern city should feel more like home to most blacks.  When Emory ain't treatin' you right or doesn't feel right at times, band together with fellow class mates and venture off campus and find something to do in the ridiculous amount of black/blacker spaces (including GSU and the HBCUs) in ATL city proper and beyond.\n\nIt's one of the few economically thriving areas that isn't as squeamish about showing and celebrating the influence of black history and culture on the area (and vs. other places, it has decent \"black middle class\" which isn't a real middle class class, but you get what I mean.  You have a chunk of relatively successful or okay'ish' off blacks in the area as well as a lot of black run and owned institutions that are holding up as well as they can) so try not to get stuck in the Emory bubble, join black orgs/meet other black people (AND faculty where available) and you'll end up as good as you can be for PWI (trust me, they'll try you).\n\nAs a black southerner, I'd actually be more afraid of being at an elite PWI up north given that the demographics of most of those cities are not in my favor and even where we exist, we aren't actually celebrated or appreciated as part of those cities as much.  At least ATL tries (has a crap ton of work to do, but tries harder than most. Emory reflects it in that regard).  There is nothing special with regards to race about the NE.  There is a reason so many are flocking back to the south. Many of us got locked out of success in those cities and then priced out. Just because you might not run into a 'redneck' in a NE city doesn't mean it's all gravy (the racism of white liberals and moderates can be much more impactful honestly because sometimes you go unaware of what they are up to).  If they were paragons of equality or whatever, this wouldn't be happening.  For all the issues still in the south, at least there is some comfort and strength in numbers.",
