  "text": "Hi guys, I'm an incoming freshmen and I want to ask a little bit about the libraries at Emory. \n\n1. Which ones are the best for individual work and which are best for group work?\n2. Are there printers in all of the libraries?\n3. Which of the libraries open past midnight?\n4. Are students studying at the library usually respectful of each other's silence?\n\nThank you so much for your guys' help!",

Also, there\u2019s group study rooms with whiteboards and large tables.\n\nAlso, theres a library on the same floor with probably all the Chem textbooks Emory uses and some physics/math books. Not sure if that part is relevant to what you\u2019re studying, but it\u2019s still nice. Food and drinks are allowed here too! so if you want to eat while studying it\u2019s a great option. \n\n\nCheck too see if your department has a lounge for majors because it could be a good place to get a snack and relax. I generally hang out at the Physics lounge between classes just because it\u2019s convenient and I do a fair bit of studying there. Otherwise, the Matheson Reading Room in Candler Library is beautiful and is usually super quiet.",

Woodruff Memorial Library has some of everything, with bottom floors for loud (group) work and top floors for individual work, as well as group study rooms, individual carrels, etc. The theology building and library have some really nice study spots too though. Atwood's science commons is great for group activity.\n2. Yes. You can see all the printers at Emory [here](https://ats.emory.edu/sdl/EaglePrint/).\n3. I believe Woodruff is open 24/5... Atwood's science commons doesn't kick people out but I think the doors to the building do lock at night. Health Science Library might also be open past midnight... best check [libraries.emory.edu/hours/](https://libraries.emory.edu/hours/) but note those are the summer hours right now which is much more restricted.\n4. Yes, though it depends if you're in a designated quiet space or not.  They're labeled.",
