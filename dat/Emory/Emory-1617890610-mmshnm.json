              "text": "The whole Executive Board watches tryouts at the beginning of the fall semester\u2014anyone is welcome to come try out the first round, then we invite specific people back for a second round of callbacks. \n\nThe team competes in a fall invitational season and a spring competitive season. In the fall, we have three teams which aren\u2019t stacked into A B and C teams\u2014they\u2019re just based on availability for tournament dates. In the spring, the Executive Board makes stacking decisions based on member performance/roles needed on each team, etc....We don\u2019t have a coach. \n\nAs for the time commitment, I won\u2019t lie it\u2019s a lot...fall season starts out with practice usually 2x per week but it ramps up quite a bit as the year progresses. However, I will say that it doesn\u2019t feel like work to me\u2014I love every minute of being on this team, and we\u2019re one of the most successful organizations at Emory (#10 in the country). \n\nHope that answers your questions! :)",
