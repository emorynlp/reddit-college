I am a potential Bio major on the premed track, and am using IB credit to skip Chem 150 + lab and Biol 141.\n\n* Biol 141 lab - Cole\n* Chem 202Z + lab - Soria\n* Engrd 101 - Lawrence\n* Psyc 190 - Duke\n* Hlth 100\n* Ecs 101\n\nPlease let me know if there are any recommendations for professors to take!

I\u2019d maybe consider swapping one of them with another class you\u2019re interested in and then taking whatever writing requirement you choose not to take 2nd semester. Other than that it looks pretty good and manageable. Most of your work will be from chem.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re taking engrd 101 Merwin is great if he fits your schedule/his class looks interesting to you. I had him first semester and it was a fun and doable class.",

Just because it is 'unusual' doesn't mean it's wrong or harmful and at least they come from different departments. I actually think that is what I did, but I forget).  Their schedule can easily handle both of those (and I'm sure many take them together).   Theoretically they can take an addition FSem in spring if they wanted to and they would pick up bio 142 and some other non-FSem/FWR gen. eds in the spring. Hell, in spring they could even start on CWRs (combined with some other GER category) if they wanted to.  It could free them to do cooler stuff in the spring or even have a lighter load as they'll pick up that 142 lecture and have chem 203-z which is usually not a walk in the park (even considering that Soria teaches 202-z).",

Also, taking a light FSEM 2nd semester would make adjusting to taking bio/chem at the same time easier. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a difference in what they can get done in one year by taking both at the same semester or spreading them out over two. It\u2019s just a question as to whether or not OP minds doing that much writing/reading I guess. I think most people don\u2019t take it at that time for the same reason.",

                  "text": "Eh...some of those FWRs and seminars can be light or very manageable (there ARE some intense seminars, I won't lie.  I took one).  And 2 classes with a reasonable amount of reading and writing is not that bad.  Most people should be able to handle that.  It balances the STEM classes and hones skills likely sort of underdeveloped in HS.  The STEM classes will largely be p-sets and stuff (and Soria usually increases the intensity of exams as the course goes along, so students can get into a rhythm with workload there and other classes in the first month or so).\n\nI honestly feel like Emory sort of under-develops reading and writing skills in STEM undergrads. Some of the CWRs are a little too soft and you have majors like biology that don't even require writing within the major (and you can theoretically even dodge disciplinary reading because you can go through the columns and avoid the courses with literature discussion sections).  And majors like chemistry and NBB have plenty of pre-grads (vs. only pre-meds) where reading and writing becomes very important (yet NBB majors don't really write within the major until senior year. Same with chemistry because AFAIK, very few or no foundation labs maybe minus Soria's require a scientific paper or lab report to be written at any point which is common at many peer schools and definitely at public schools). I've seen some awful awful stuff of students going through prelims and capstones in my program, including from those coming from elite universities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI figure plenty of random easy 100 level (and even 200 level) courses will open up in spring for them to take and they can enroll in them because they won't have any of the first year requirements taking up a spot.  That's the way I was thinking about it.",

I\u2019m taking the professor now and the subject your seminar is on doesn\u2019t seem heavy. Not any reviews on RMP on Lawrence and haven\u2019t heard of him so don\u2019t know how the workload will be like. Could be a lot, could be a little. \n\nI mean honestly your schedule seems pretty light and manageable. I still think it\u2019d be better to take an easy FSEM 2nd semester just so you can get adjusted to chem/bio at the same time, and because lighter FSEMs aren\u2019t super hard to find imo. There\u2019s no right answer though and I\u2019d just do whatever you think is best for you. Obviously idk everything either.\n\nAll exams for your classes should be the same time as you go to them. They were in the evening last year because everything was online and they wanted people to take it at the same time (I think to prevent sharing exam content across sections).",

Admittedly during Covid, it likely was due to coordination issues, but before it was pedagogical.  And you should know that with either Weinschenk or Heemstra, those exams will be at least a 2hr allotment in the evening so plan to have similar schedules as you did last year for chemistry at least.  Chemistry is a department that tends to give more legit exams that stress the higher ordered and conceptual thinking.  They take the training wheels off in upper divisions where they bring the time pressure back whether they use the high level items or not.",

                          "text": "Her exams weren't the same calibre as many previous 202 classes.  The FRQ section was shorter and simpler and she likely did that to ensure her exams were more comparable to the online sections.  I saw them and could envision them taking only 75 minutes(or however long classes were), but her 2020 exams (in 2020 at least up to Covid shutdown and maybe even 2019) were a little more involved/intense. 2017 was definitely more involved and had a longer FRQ section because she gave 90 minutes.\n\nAnd for Weinschenk, he may use parts of white hall, or even the WHSAB if he wants everyone in the same building and on some of those exams, you may ge\u2020 3 hours (He usually budgets them for a certain amount of time and adds 30 minutes).  Heemstra often allows for 2-2.5 hours.\n\nOne reason they do this is because the molecules you deal with tend to be larger in 203 than 202, and the reaction mechanisms/curly arrow formalism problems tend to be more complex.  They also ask for a decent amount of analysis and explanation of reactivity, often using the MO theory frame work to explain it.  All that stuff, even for a well-prepared student can be time intensive.  Weinschenk's questions often take more thinking than average even beyond that issue which is why he some times gives 3 hours (and may extend depending upon how many people are still working around like 2.75hrs and whatnot).",

If unlucky, you'll only get 2 hours on the more difficult exams later in the semester :( ).  And also, when pre-med reqs say that, they usually are talking broader classes like psych 111/110 and soc. 101/230, not seminars like psych 190 which are very focused on something sort of niche if you know what I mean.  So don't take 190 under the guise of fullfilling pre-med reqs. Just take it for fun/because you want to.
