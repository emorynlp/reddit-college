  "text": "Hey everyone! I got into Emory for Epidemiology and will be relocating from Florida. I was wondering if I could get some insight on how everyone was going to manage to pay rent or how to use student loans to pay for rent during Gras school. I have never had to use student loans before and I am very thankful for that but now I am in a situation where I am constantly under stress because I haven't found a part-time job yet so I don't know how I would get approved for an apartment/house with student loans money or how it even gets distributed. How do we receive our Grad plus loans or FAFSA loan money? Does anyone know if student loans are enough for rent or if landlords are hesitant to lease to grad students because of this? It's really hard leaving my home state and not having a place to live yet and I wonder if anyone else feels this huge pressure too. :(  I feel completely lost.",

      "text": "There are lots of people that choose to live off of student loans for grad school. Idk about the approval process (probably just a credit check,  background check and something to ensure you're able to pay monthly), but generally grad students stay in student apartments or apartments close to campus that are used to taking students and it hasn't been a problem. You can specify how much money you want taken out in loans and it goes to the school first, then whatever is leftover, you get it in a refund which comes direct deposit. For emory, it's usually dispersed right before the semester starts",

      "text": "Hi, ill be a grad student in nursing in the fall, but I took out loans as an undergraduate so I know the process. Basically if you have filled out your FAFSA you get an EFC which is how much you are expected to contribute per year. The school has a set tuition and expenses amount, then they add in living expenses(includes estimated rent and food) and that gets you the COA cost of attendance. If you are taking out graduate loans you have 2 options, the unsubsidized loan and the grad plus loans. I believe the unsubsidized loan caps at 20.5k per year and the n you can take out the rest of the COA in grad plus loans but you cannot take out more loan money than the COA. The money is disbursed initially to the school and then you get what ever is left over at the beginning of each semester, usually a day before classes start. That being said the money for the initial deposit and first months rent typically has to come out of pocket in my experience",
