I believe Emory considers both unweighted and weighted, so if you can get ur SAT up even to like a 1470, you'd be in a really good place\n\nMy advice is to submit bc it falls within the average range. They may think your score is below the range if you don't submit. Good luck!",

I do think ED has a higher acceptance rate (I believe 20ish% for ED 1 and 2 and like 9% for regular, but don't quote me on that)",

I wasn\u2019t on r/applyingtocollege while the SAT was optional so don\u2019t know what scenarios it\u2019d be good in.\n\nYou could also apply ED to a school you like but isn\u2019t necessarily your dream school where ED helps (like WashU, northwestern, etc.) if you don\u2019t mind not being overly ambitious. That way it won\u2019t sting a ton if you get rejected. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea because most people don\u2019t get into their dream schools anyways. I mean, when I was a senior I wanted to go to Hopkins but I ended up being happy here.",
