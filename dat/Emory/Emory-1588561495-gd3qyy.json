  "text": "Our team has 5 GT students, with 4 CS and 1 Business ITM & Data Analytics student, and we are currently looking for an Emory student. We are in the Create-X program at Georgia Tech with an idea to help gyms mitigate congestion issues in the aftermath of COVID-19. Our website is [gymsplat.com](http://gymsplat.com/). We are even using computer vision technology to track accurate crowd counts of people at gyms, including which sections they worked out at. \n\nWe really need an Emory student with a background in public health to help us make a strong argument for how we will help prevent the spread of the virus. If anyone is interested, please message me!",
