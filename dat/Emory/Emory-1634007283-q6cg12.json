  "title:": "Question about Emory 2022 supplemental essay",
  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in High School applying to Emory and I\u2019m a bit confused about what the first supplemental essay is asking for.  The prompt is, \u201cWhat academic areas are you interested in exploring in college?\u201d (200 words). I\u2019ve been told that I should devote at least half of it to programs at Emory related to my major but since the prompt doesn\u2019t specifically ask that, I\u2019m nervous I\u2019ll come off as disingenuous.  Any advice?",

      "text": "Ngl it probably doesn\u2019t matter. As long as you have semi coherent thoughts, it checks a box. If you have all the other stuff you need to get in cool too. Talk about what you\u2019re actually interested in so you don\u2019t sound disingenuous, major or some interest besides a major because the liberal arts education is so wonderful it lets you study so many different things\u2026 it doesn\u2019t greatly matter",
