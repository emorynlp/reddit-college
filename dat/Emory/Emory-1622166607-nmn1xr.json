I thought it was wild. Only happened once, though. Another time I got a surprise grant and my aid didn't change. I'd still take the outside scholarship.",

      "text": "In my experience, merit based outside scholarships stack. Be aware that if you get scholarships in excess of the cost of tuition (aka that you use to cover room/board etc) that is considered taxable income. Scholarships generally do have to be used on \"qualifying educational expenses\" so you can't keep scholarships far above the cost of attendance - that'd be fraud.",
