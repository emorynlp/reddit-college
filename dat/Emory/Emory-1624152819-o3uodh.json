  "text": "Hey guys so I am an incoming ox sophomore and I was planning on applying to the bschool since I\u2019ve almost finished the prereqs but I have been considering majoring in something else like polisci instead. However, I am still interested in studying business (just maybe not enough to major in it) and was wondering if there is the option to minor in something the b school offers while majoring at the college? I\u2019m prelaw but am worried about the practicality of a degree in Polisci if that goal were to not work out the way I want. I know the answer to my question is probably no but I couldn\u2019t find a clear answer online.",

      "text": "If you wanna increase the practicality, maybe consider PPA, econ double major, or political science/math joint major instead. Either way, you can do it by taking more quantitative oriented or analytically focused courses  find some experiential learning (including classical internships) opps to couple it with. Basically figure out some careers that political science might fit and plan your ECs and co-curriculars accordingly.  A little minor in business or even a half assed major (where you don't make time for all the networking and professional development oppurtunities) just won't be enough to increase your marketability. Without fuller immersion into GBS, the business courses, minor(pretty sure GBS doesn't do minors), whatever will do very little for you and will just sort of be labels on a transcript that won't impress.\n\nAlso please remember that pre-laws can and do literally  major in whatever the heck they want. They just need to keep a solid GPA and do well on the LSAT. You can honestly major in business if you want and maybe find time to take political science courses (ideally ones that will strengthen writing skills..and that can easily be done through many ECAS depts) you like OR even just double major with whatever GBS primary depth and polsci. Law schools won't care as long as you perform well. If you like politics, you can also use your ECs and different fellowships to simply get involved in it without even majoring in polsci.  Rarely is there a 1:1 correspondence to major and experiential opps and entry level jobs outside of STEM at the stage you are at so keep an open mind about how you may approach things and the find and use career resources and faculty (and others) mentors to help you navigate all of it.",
