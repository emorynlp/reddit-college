But, I'm afraid that Emory is not whatsoever known for this major (and couldn't find enough reviews of Emory's program). \n\nI'm still leaning greatly toward Emory, though not sure whether it's suitable for my interests. So, how was your experience? \n\np.s. if that helps, I'm an international student.",

Also I think Emory has generally very strong politics programs because of its connection to Jimmy Carter and whatnot",

I would say, it probably helps that you're a son of a diplomat. that's a nice CV to have. maybe you can ask him about what i ttakes to get that sort of position.",

The one problem I have is that the website for major requirements seems outdated,  and when you have your advising meeting about classes you need to take, it actually sounds kind of confusing because some classes may not always be considered \"fulfilling the major\" requirements in the future when you graduate. It's helpful to use the degree tracker on OPUS.",
