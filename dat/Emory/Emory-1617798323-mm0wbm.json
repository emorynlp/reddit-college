To figure out how many classes this means, you can look at the courses atlas (literally just type into Google \"Emory Courses Atlas\"). Most classes are 3-4 credits. So, that means your maximum # of classes will probably be 5. Minimum credit hours is 12.\n\nFor freshman, they have to take PACE and Health their 1st sem. Each is 1 credit, so that leaves you with 15 credits for other classes.",

For example, a chemistry, biology, or NBB major could theoretically take a STEM as their writing requirement.  Likewise, many humanities and social science majors can likely fullfill ALL of their CWRT reqs and (HSCs) simply by being that type of major.  \n\nI think what rarely or never happens is that a course counts as two of the broader areas",
