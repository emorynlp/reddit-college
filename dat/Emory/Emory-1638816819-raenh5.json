We don\u2019t get to see the applicant\u2019s grades, standardized test scores, etc. We only see the applicant\u2019s name, intended major, a few ECs, and high school attended. \n\nIn other words, it doesn\u2019t matter if a student has a 2.0 GPA and a 20 on the ACT or a 4.0 GPA and a 36 on the ACT.
