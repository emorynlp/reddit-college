      "text": "As a disclaimer, I have not specifically taken Emory's Phil courses, but I have a degree in the subject. Intro to Phil likely will be the easier of the two and provide a broader foundation. Logic tends to be very polarizing with people either getting it and loving it, or having trouble making it click at all. Are you planning on continuing in Phil after these courses? If so, either would be a fine call. If you're not planning on continuing Phil, what are you doing? If it's anything math, law, or comp sci related, logic will be a huge help. If it's more humanities oriented, the intro course will likely provide a stronger baseline knowledge to draw from. \n\nIf you're still on the fence or unclear I'm happy to look into the courses and postulate on what will specifically be covered and how. Best of luck!",
