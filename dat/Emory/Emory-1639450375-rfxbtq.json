  "text": "I am thinking about taking summer courses in my home country (I really miss home!!). However, this program does not list specific accredited universities, and someone who has done this before stated that I will have to submit the syllabus of the course I plan to get approval to transfer credits. Would someone mind sharing their experiences? Is it true that it costs $1700 per summer credit hour as I've seen on some websites?? Appreciate any helpful advice in advance!!!",
