  "title:": "Safety at Emory (please give me a realistic idea, whether it's advice or reassurance)",
  "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm joining Emory's class of 2025 this fall. I'm beyond thrilled, it was my top choice.\n\nBUT I'm of Asian descent, and I'm also a small woman. On top of that, I have some heavy trauma from rape by a former partner. I'm really, really scared to be going out on my own for the first time especially in times like this, and those shootings in ATL. I feel like I'm always walking around with a target on my back. I can't even begin to explain how exhausting it is, but it's my life now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just want to be prepared for life at Emory. I'll be living there. I just want to know how things are looking, what Emory (and the area I guess) is like in terms of safety in these categories, and if there's any advice people have for me.\n\nEven if it's just some reassurance, it would be awesome. Anything helps at this point. Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "First off, I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through all that you\u2019ve been through. \n\nEmory\u2019s campus is very safe. If you are on campus, you will always be in sight of a blue light, which can be used to contact police if needed (although I have never seen anybody have to use one). There is also the LiveSafe app where you can have someone virtually walk you home if that makes you comfortable. Every night there is also Safe Ride (I think it\u2019s 9PM-5AM), which you can call and have them pick you up and drop you off anywhere on or around campus. All in all, I have felt incredibly safe during my time at Emory.",

Also, there's an awesome PE class called Personal Self Defense for Women or something like that. It was really fun and also helped me feel more confident.",

      "text": "So sorry you've had to endure that. I second what others have said about blue lights, live safe, and safe ride. However, I as a woman (but not of Asian descent) never used those options and never felt unsafe on campus, even though I enjoy clearing my head by taking walks alone at night (12am and onwards). The campus is not an urban campus in the sense that it is several miles from the city center and surrounded by expensive, cute, suburban neighborhoods. You rarely see folks on campus who are not Emory students, employees/affiliates, or high school families touring, except around the Emory hospital. Theft/ burglary are by far the most common crimes on campus (lock your room and don't leave your laptop/phone unattended in public places) but date rape and sexual assualt at parties do occaisionally occur.",

      "text": "I get where you\u2019re coming from, and echoing another commenter, I would literally walk around campus in the dead of night out of sheer boredom and never felt like I was in danger. Even stepping slightly outside of campus to get Dominos or to the CVS in the shopping center nearby (Emory Village if you want to search images of it), the worst I had to worry about was cars barreling too fast down the road. Emory campus is safe in that regard! \n\nI can\u2019t speak for risks at parties though, I avoided events like those.",
