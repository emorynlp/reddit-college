  "title:": "Do I hope I get into weinschenk class or move around my whole schedule to guarantee chem with Hill?",
  "text": "right now I'm 5th on the waitlist for Weinschenk. I hope to get him since he's an excellent professor, but the problem is that I'm worried that I may never end up off his waitlist by the time add/drop/swap ends, and I'll be left without a chem 202 class next sem. I don't really want to take Hill, since his ratings are so horrible, but I need to take 202 next sem. What should I do?\n\nAlso, if i hypothetically got to 1st or 2nd on the Weinschenk waitlist would he expand the class size if I asked him to?\n\nThanks for the advice!",

      "text": "I would wait and view Hill as a last resort (He's awful and if by some miracle he chose to be a joke vs. Use the materials and tests of other sections, he'd likely put you in an awful position for 203 with ANYONE, including allegedly 'easier' sections like Heemstra).  People who are part of other waitlists are likely already enrolled in a section so Hill is probably safe. The goal should be to get in literally anywhere else but Hill.",

      "text": "Honestly at this point I would recommend waiting a bit longer! I believe Hill's class still has a lot of space. Maybe if you are not in Weinsheik by the beginning of next semester, then would be a good time to enroll in a different section (definitely before a/d/s ends if you don't get in). 5th is a really good spot and I would have my hopes up for a while longer.",
