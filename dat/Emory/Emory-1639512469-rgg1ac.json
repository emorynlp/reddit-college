  "text": "right now I'm 5th on the waitlist for Weinschenk. I hope to get him since he's an excellent professor, but the problem is that I'm worried that I may never end up off his waitlist by the time add/drop/swap ends, and I'll be left without a chem 202 class next sem. I don't really want to take Hill, since his ratings are so horrible, but I need to take 202 next sem. What should I do?\n\nAlso, if i hypothetically got to 1st or 2nd on the Weinschenk waitlist would he expand the class size if I asked him to?\n\nThanks for the advice!",
