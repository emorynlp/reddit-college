              "text": "my rule is don't send anyone money unless you see something in person. No \"i'm out of town. i will send you the keys once you send me money bs\". You get used to what is a scam and what isn't the more you look but if you follow this rule you should be okay.  most people that i've known wait until they're in the city to look at/decide on a place/ roommates and get an airbnb in the meantime. I know this can be expensive but it's better than going into someplace blind imo.",

Virtual tours are becoming more popular though and I might feel better going with one say if there\u2019s an actual (local) agent I\u2019m working with there in person rather than finding something myself offline. If the apartment looks super super nice compared to comps in the same price range or is in the \u201cperfect\u201d area then I have my guard up. In person or someone there locally is always better.",
