None of us \"chose\" to cheat because usually this groupme chat is just for the whole group to keep in touch with one another. I admitted to using the questions to help study. There was a trial and it was a very fair process. They will not convict you of anything if they dont have evidence. I basically told them, hey, there was this leaked question, I made a flashcard to study this question, I acknowledge that this gave me an unfair advantage. They were very understanding and gave us all a warning. Just be honest and nothing bad will happen. Emory is pretty awesome at this please dont worry",

It speaks to the integrity of the education. They aren't heartless though. Like someone else said, they are probably flagging a lot of questionable activity RN due to online finals. Just be honest and clear. Don't admit to anything you havent done to expedite the process. Just know youre not alone. Feel free to reach out to myself or an ombuds person too.",

They are able to monitor when you answer questions and how quickly as well, and here\u2019s where they get a lot of people, when you leave the window/change windows. So the information they have is limited. With that in mind you can probably make a good case for your innocence. There\u2019s a shit ton of cases going on rn to the point where they\u2019ve been sending emails saying if you confess they\u2019ll expedite your case which tbh sounds like some Bull Shit so they don\u2019t have to work as hard. If you\u2019re innocent I would run that shit and make them work for it. The honor council and some of these professors are honestly going off for the smallest things. Trust the process a little but trust yourself and your story more. Don\u2019t let them ruin your credibility and your chance at future graduate/professional schools just because they can\u2019t understand that during a time of world wide crisis they should create a system that doesn\u2019t screw over its students but allows them to reach their goals within the bounds of their circumstances. It\u2019s a product of ridiculous privilege at an institution full of ridiculous privilege.\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk",
