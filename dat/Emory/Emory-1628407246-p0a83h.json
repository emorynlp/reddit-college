  "text": "Hi all! I'm an incoming freshman trying to choose what classes to prioritize for Monday registration & had a few questions.\n\nDo smaller classes for major requirements (CPLT 201 specifically) tend to fill up quickly? How about compared to Chem 150L?\n\nContext: I'm on the pre-health track and am planning to register for Chem 150+L first. I'm also planning to double major in Comp lit though. I wouldn't be able to add CPLT 201 to the list for Monday because it exceeds 8 credits, and I wasn't sure if there would still be space Tuesday. Should I be prioritizing it over chem 150L?",
