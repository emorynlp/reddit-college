  "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed Intro to Fiction Writing with Gabriel Houck before the pandemic, and ever since then I've been trying to get into Intermediate Fiction but the class always fills up so fast. Unfortunately, this is my last semester here and I didn't get into the course(I guess Haynes didn't like my application). That means I would need to attend an entire semester just for one course next year if I wanted to take the class again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn light of this, what Continued Writing course would you recommend? I'm all ears.",
