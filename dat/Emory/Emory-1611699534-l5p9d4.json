Felt a bit like a gladiatorial arena. \n\nOxford also had a Nerf club for a bit. So you can probably get something going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n/cheap advertising moment/ \n\nIf you ever need to fix your stuff, come by [TechLab](https://ats.emory.edu/sdl/techlab/). Hopefully we can make sure to have the tools and equipment you need to make repairs or modifications",
