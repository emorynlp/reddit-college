  "text": "As you can tell by my flare, I am committed to attend Oxford this coming fall. As it stands, I intend on majoring in PPL and minoring in music but I feel a second major/minor in either econ or a language would be incredibly beneficial to my growth as a scholar and my marketability in the next stage of my life. Is it common/conceivable for someone to do a double major with a minor or vice versa? Thanks!",

      "text": "As the other poster said, you can only have two concentrations. Setting that aside, the requirements for those minors or majors are sometimes padded and sometimes they are flexible. What they are is simple: a line on a piece of paper. It doesn't mean anything in the long run.\n\nWhat does mean something in the long run is taking a class because you *are interested in it* and not to check the box on arbitrary requirements for a minor/major. You may find that you do not agree with these requirements and you want to explore other avenues. Take a class that sounds interesting to you, whether or not it satisfies a minor/major. As long as you complete one concentration, you can graduate. Most classes are open to everyone, besides the ones locked behind professional schools.",

      "text": "You need to narrow this down per rules of ECAS: [http://catalog.college.emory.edu/department-program/concentration.php](http://catalog.college.emory.edu/department-program/concentration.php)\n\nPLEASE keep in mind that your degree and education is not about labels.  If you wanna do two, then choose the two you like the best or are most beneficial to whatever you wanna pursue.  For example, you can easily take a healthy helping of GOOD and relevant economics courses beyond intro and intermediate level courses that would make you \"marketable\" without majoring or minoring. You can take some math, CS, and QTM courses (ones not restricted to majors) as well.  An employer or graduate program (which will likely be a niche program or subdiscipline you'd be targeting to do research in) will look at the specifics of your preparation and see if they align with the needed competencies and skills for the job or, in the case of grad. school, whether it aligns with research interests in whatever schools' departments.  Unless a description specifies a specific major (rare for most areas that are targeted by social science, business, and humanities majors), they aren't gonna go \"econ major, check. X minor, check\".  They wanna see evidence of certain skills beyond those labels.  You might for example have to use a cover letter to explain a project or something you did in a particular course or outside of class that aligns with the job description or submit a writing sample, whatever.  The best way to look marketable is simply train yourself to be marketable.",
