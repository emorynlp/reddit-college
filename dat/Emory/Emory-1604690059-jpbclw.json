  "text": "ETA: [Click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AbOKxvNNaQ8E6eOHTI3DpDFmPLbP5OKF6pKPcHSYxyA/) for a **Comprehensive Georgia\nVoter Resource Guide** by [Turnout Nation](https://www.turnoutnation.org/).\n\nThings aren\u2019t over quite yet for you voters in Georgia! Both **Georgia Senate races are headed to a January 2021 runoff that could decide Senate control**. You student voters will play a big and important role in this! \n\n\u2022 Candidates in the upcoming runoffs will face **another election on JANUARY 5, 2021**. \u2022 Absentee voters should **aim to request an absentee ballot by DECEMBER 19, 2020**__***__ (for those who voted absentee in the General Election, **you will not automatically be sent another absentee ballot for the runoff if you don\u2019t make a separate request for one**. Your prior absentee ballot request for the General Election does not apply to the runoff). \u2022 The **deadline to register to vote for the runoff is DECEMBER 7, 2020**. \u2022 Early voting for the runoff will begin on DECEMBER 14, 2020.\n\n__***__ The official deadline to submit an absentee ballot request application is the Wednesday before the election (**DECEMBER 30, 2020**) but it is **very strongly** recommended that you submit your request much further in advance, to guarantee that your completed ballot will ultimately be received by your election officials within the time frame that your vote can be counted. For those returning their absentee ballot by mail, try to mail the ballot by **DECEMBER 26, 2020**.\n\nSource: https://sos.ga.gov/admin/files/2020%20Revised%20Short%20Calendar.pdf\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t register and vote for the general election, you can still register and vote for the runoffs!\n\nAre you **17 years old but will be 18 by JANUARY 5, 2021? You are eligible to vote in the runoffs!** Please register by DECEMBER 7, 2020.\n\n**Learn how to register to vote in Georgia** [here](https://georgia.gov/register-to-vote) or [here](https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/register_to_vote).\n\n**ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO EMORY STUDENTS:**\n\nDid you know that if you\u2019re a college student coming from another state who is currently living on-campus or off-campus in Georgia, you can register to vote in the Georgia runoffs? If you are living in on-campus housing in Georgia, you qualify as a resident of Georgia using your on-campus address and can register to vote in Georgia! If you are in Georgia but live off-campus, you can use the street address of your off-campus housing in Georgia to register. This applies even if you voted in your home state for the General Election!\n\nGo [here](https://www.campusvoteproject.org/stateguides/georgia), [here](https://campuselect.org/voter-education/candidate-issue-guides/student-voter-guide-for-georgia-2020-primary-election/) and [here](https://emorywheel.com/a-college-students-guide-to-voting/) for more info about this. [This source](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1633_8716_93658_102162-538201--,00.html) is specific to Michigan but a lot of the information given is still very helpful for student voters in Georgia. Also, feel free to message me!\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\n\nNeed to request an absentee ballot? You can request one online, in person, by mail or by fax! Go here to learn more about **requesting your absentee ballot**: https://georgia.gov/vote-absentee-ballot\n\nFinally, go here to find the contact info (telephone, fax, email, mailing address) of **your county\u2019s board of registrar\u2019s office**: https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do\n\nContact them to discuss the options available to you!\n\n**PLEASE SHARE! THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!**",
