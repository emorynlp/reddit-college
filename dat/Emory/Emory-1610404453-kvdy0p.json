  "text": "For one of my classes, which is collectively taught by three professors, has our final project replace if it one of previous assignments, of which there were two, if you received a higher grade on it. However, on Canvas, after consulting with classmates, only one of the assignments was set to do so, meaning that for me, I received a lower grade than I should have. I have since emailed the professor twice with no response, so what should I do.",
