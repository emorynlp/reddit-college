  "text": "Has anyone switched before? What about between fall and spring semester? Did your instructor change? Do I just apply for 310 next semester?\n\nOriginally wanted to be a music major but really reconsidering my options since I realized I just wanted lessons and don\u2019t want to take all the extra music classes",

      "text": "When I auditioned they said you don't have to be a major to take MUS 320. But that could be because I am a freshman. What they said was taking MUS 320 just meant I was considering a music major, but since I don't have to declare a major yet, I could back out if I wanted to later. But they did say if I decide to become a music major, the 310 credits won't transfer.",
