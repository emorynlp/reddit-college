      "text": "Eh just try some stuff. However more questions need  to be answered to help more seriously:\n\n1) Are you an incoming freshmen? If not, what have you taken already?\n\n2) Are you pre-med or pre-med in a tunnelvision sense? If not, you may be able to explore more and at a faster or slower pace AND you may be able to take more risks depending on..\n\n3) what AP/IB/dual enrollment credits will your bring in?  If you have this in things like chem, CS, bio, whatever, you may be able to gain access to slightly more advanced courses or even freshman only courses (like chem z sequence) that may give you a clearer idea about what each major is about (often intro STEMs can mislead you and make it seem as if a major will be easy/come natural to you or the opposite, it may be very boring and turn you off because it didn't cover the more interesting topics, problems, or ways of thinking in the field or you may get a professor less well equipped for large class sizes and intro content, leaving a bad taste in your mouth about future classes).\n\n It may also open your schedule up to even more exploration (for example, if you use chem and bio, you can skip 141 lecture and chem 150 lab and lecture in fall...if you decide against Z.. which would open up your schedule to CS 170 which is apparently pretty demanding and definitely would be as such with chem and/or bio).",
