  "title:": "I'm feeling really anxious about going to Oxford...",
  "text": "Hi! I'm a high school senior who was accepted into Oxford College in ED 1. I originally applied to both the Atlanta and Oxford campuses, but the Atlanta campus didn't accept me. I'm nervous about spending the next 2 years in Covington (I generally prefer urban settings), and I've been hearing some pretty negative things about the campus. I know some people have said that the food isn't particularly good, there was a mold problem in the dorms, the counseling department isn't helpful, etc. Some people have also told me that I didn't get into the main campus because I wasn't smart enough or because I didn't work hard enough, and I'd be lying if I said that hasn't been taking a toll on my emotional health. \n\nBut I've also heard that the small campus and class sizes foster strong interpersonal relationships and that the professors care more for their students, so I feel really conflicted about my acceptance. Some days it seems like I've been given a prison sentence and some days I genuinely can't wait to go to college.\n\nMaybe I'm being stupid for being nervous, but I would really appreciate it if anyone here could talk a bit about their experience at Oxford. I'm so grateful to have been accepted into Emory at all, but I'd love to hear a first-person account of the campus! Is the food truly not that good? Are the professors more engaging with the students? Do students at the main campus look down on Oxford students? Please let me know! Anything is helpful. :)",

      "text": "oxford grad here! first off, what you've been told about smarter kids getting into main is complete bullshit. i also was only accepted into oxford and when my parents contacted the admissions office about why i hadn't gotten into main (im an emory legacy so they were curious lol) and they were told that it was because they needed to fill in oxford's class and they usually take more into oxford from early decisions who apply both to campuses. granted, i also wrote in one of my supplementals that i really value small, tight-knit communities, so that likely also had a big factor. \n\nbut i totally agree with what another commenter said, just ignore and ditch whoever told you that.  ive heard there is a subtle bias against oxford kids, but it's not that main kids are mean to oxford kids or anything like that. from my experience, main kids really dont care lol. it's just sometimes atlanta clubs are wary to accept oxford grads in because they didnt spend the past two years at main. it kinda sucks but thats really the worst of it, which isnt that bad at all imo.\n\ni truly loved my experience at oxford and i miss it so much. i'm currently a junior and ive been taking this year at home so i cant compare to main, but i wouldnt trade my years at oxford for literally anything. i met some fantastic people who i consider lifelong friends and i loved the campus. it's gorgeous and super easy to get around. and i didnt find the food that bad at all! everyone likes to joke about it but it's good more often than it's bad. small details: cool salad bar, awesome sandwich bar, we get free coke freestyle machines, and the soft serve SMACKS. better than the soft serve at main imo.\n\nit is a bit isolated though, but that's something i personally enjoy. however if you want to get out and about, the shuttle system is pretty great and shuttles to and from main run every day. we also have some walmart/target/etc shuttles if you ever need to get groceries, go watch a movie, or grab some freddies. so there's more than enough to do outside of campus during the week, and there are loads of weekend shuttles to main for lengthier trips. weekend shuttles go until late hours of the night if you're interested in greek life.\n\nin terms of academics and extracurriculars, i had opportunities at oxford that would have been either much more difficult to obtain or literally impossible at main. for instance i was co-president of my club my sophomore year and got some great leadership skills. i'm also working closely with another oxford grad and oxford professor on research and we're on track to getting published, an opportunity i only had because of my oxford friends who helped me out and our tight-knit classes. i also got pretty close with the two professors of my major and i adored their classes. class discussions are easy and actually fun because our classes typically range from 15-25 students (and never more than 25).\n\nanyways, sorry for this wall of text! i miss oxford a lot and im so excited for you. if you have any questions at all, feel free to send me a pm or chat! i'd be stoked to chat :)\n\nedit: oh, and for living accomodations!! IF YOU WANT GOOD HOUSING when you fill out your sheet for preferred housing DONT put same gender buildings!! that'll for sure land you in jrc which is the mold building lol. if you put any other option it's kind of a coin toss (although putting any gender roommate will land you in 2nd floor elizer which is pretty nice) but that one for sure will land you in jrc. but jrc has it perks! i lived there freshmen year and it has the best location and hugeee sinks (murdy elizer and fleming have small ones so if you have a lot of toiletries it kinda sucks). every dorm building had its positives and i honestly enjoyed my time at jrc. and i never had any experience with mold! it is kinda unfair how much nicer the fleming bathrooms are tho lmao",

It sounds like the leadership opportunities are really cool too. This is honestly the first time I've been this excited for college in a while. Also, thank you for the housing tip! I really appreciate it! I'm also looking forward to the soft serve!",

      "text": "I'll let others handle the rest but what idiots do you have around you telling you stupid stuff like:\"You didn't work hard enough to get into the Atlanta campus\" when they are basically statistically identical in terms of achievement metrics.?You need new friends orrrrr....is this actually something you are telling yourself because YOU feel bad about not getting into ECAS?  If the latter is true (because the first seems unlikely unless those people are really dim), you have to work on that and realize how much luck (vs. merely merit) goes into selective college admissions.  A huge chunk of the denied applicants certainly \"deserved\" and were qualified for admissions.  \n\nWhat likely happened is that adcoms need to fill Oxford's class so in early rounds choose several who are a much stronger fit for it than ECAS.  Stop telling yourself these myths of \"I didn't work hard enough\" or \"am not smart enough\" and definitely avoid and ignore any peers who tell you stupid stuff like that.  And please note that ECAS has similar quality of life problems as Ox but is just bigger.   Instead of worrying about food and mold and stuff and imperfections like that (which might not even affect you-usually when you talk a problem with a dorm that specific, it is only like one dorm or an abberation, and you'd be surprised how common certain issues are college campuses), you may wanna look forward to the friends you'll make, the things you'll get to do, and the stuff you wanna learn because, and how you want to develop intellectually (and you need tp stop doubting yourself.  I am worried about anyone who says they aren't smart enough or didn't work hard enough and then got into a school with a 1450-1500 SAT average and 3.75+ average GPA for matriculates. Gain confidence now! Or else you will not receive the challenges ahead well and Emory selected you for at least one of its campuses because you seemed like you were ready) and socially during the 2(and then 4) years at Emory.\n\n Those should be why you wanted to be part of any highly selective college and university (Most of these schools are generally known for rigorous academics, great faculty, smaller classes, lots of oppurtunities, strong alumni networks, and bright students that do interesting things on and beyond campus, NOT perfect/near perfect amenities and food. I mean Duke had frosh dorms with no air conditioning and is in freaking NC.) If you just wanted great food and perfect amenities, plenty of far less selective schools do that way better.  I also suspect that Ox AND ECAS are generally above average for their amenities and food. The bar is low, especially among privates.  It actually seems like you have general college jitters\n\n\nEither way, be well and be grateful!  Don't let perfection and your quest to look for relatively inconsequential imperfections your enemy that distracts you from a blessing.  The only reason you should be worried is if you definitely didn't want a small school or you don't wanna be academically challenged and just wanted nice amenities and stuff.",

I genuinely wanted a rigorous academic experience when I began applying to college. It's just that my rejection from the main campus really got me down, and all the talk about the mold and food made it worse. I don't go to a very prestigious high school or anything, but some of my peers are very competitive and can be kind of nasty. I was scared of telling them about my rejection and acceptance, and when I did, I took their responses and criticisms hard. But I'm still grateful I got accepted into Oxford.

              "text": "Your peers are just nasty and have no reason to be (especially if they don't go to an ultra competitive or good HS) and you shouldn't be nasty to yourself either.  Also, keep in mind that these selective privates and publics minus say the UCs have an awfully upper middle class and wealthy student body so most are gonna complain about things like food and amenities. It seems the places that get the least complaints (talking places like VU, WUSTL, Brandeis) have UNUSUALLY wealthy students (as in more 1%ers than other elites) that they are trying to please.\n\n  For anyone who went to public school, most of these colleges (but especially either Emory campus which has an unusual amount of new and renovated buildings) will be much better.  I think many complainers come from like private HSs or eat lots of 4-5 star meals and whatnot and anticipate that in college perhaps because of what they are used to and what they are paying.  Basically these schools are nice, but they aren't Hogwartz or something in terms of living conditions which is the imagery many going to these selectives want to conjure up.  Time for you to cheer up and think about how you'll remain excellent in college while having a good time as well.",

Have taken multiple classes at both and realized everyone isn't freaky geniuses (which I knew but still subconsciously was worried about cus imposter syndrome) and that we all basically struggle the same. Everyone is willing to help each other out in classes. You're not any dumber than main campus kids. The classes I took on main campus we did a bunch of group work in and I wasn't falling behind on anything, even contributing a greater percentage than my groupmates to assignments. I'd explain stuff one of them didn't understand right away and they'd explain anything I didn't. Everyone helps each other out at Oxford and at Atlanta campus, no one I've met so far is out here trying to make others feel inferior. The bigger Atlanta class size is nice when you need to blend in but the small class size at Oxford is very nice cus you get to know people and your ideas are more easily heard when you want to contribute in classes or ask questions.",

You are 100% just as smart as anyone on the Atlanta campus and I\u2019ve found my Atlanta classes quite a bit easier than my Oxford ones (especially STEM). I think food is pretty much the same, I\u2019ve heard that Atlanta kids who visit Oxford say the food at Oxford is better, but I\u2019ve heard the opposite, too. Professors are amazing and are at Oxford to build relationships with students, not because they are getting paid for research and are required to teach. Once your in Atlanta, no one really cares that you went to Oxford, they\u2019re probably more interested in what your experience was like. If anything, I joke with my atlanta friends about this made-up rivalry bc it\u2019s ridiculous. Don\u2019t count Oxford out, yet! Lmk if you have any other questions :) and welcome!!",

When I got to high school, my parents suggested that I should apply to both Atlanta and Oxford because I'm a bit introverted. I visited Oxford once, and I thought it seemed like a close-knit, quaint kind of school. I also went to Emory's admissions presentations, and they said Oxford was just like Emory, but much smaller and therefore more personal. I didn't want to make a decision that would get me into something I wasn't equipped for, so I applied to both campuses.",
