  "title:": "WAITLIST ADVICE! pls help",
  "text": "Hello! I have been waitlisted at a few schools, and I really really really want to get off the waitlist into Emory University. I was also waitlisted at Duke, Georgetown, and Dartmouth (three terrific schools but I wanna go to Emory ya feel me?). I have been grinding to maximize my chances to get into Emory, and I know that my stats, extracurriculars, etc. are good enough for the school. Here is what I've done so far:\n\n1. Wrote a banger LOCI\n2. Reached out to the top economics professor and was able to meet and talk with him (i wrote about this in the LOCI)\n3. Going to submit another teacher rec (not sure if this'll really help so let me know if this is a good idea)\n\nI've gone quite above and beyond, but I would just like to ask if anyone has any other ideas that I could maybe consider to help my chances. But if you guys think this is already enough (which my friends have said), just let me know haha!\n\nThank you!",
