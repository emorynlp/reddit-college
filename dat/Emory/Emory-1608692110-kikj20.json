There are a lot of great opportunities and the faculty and staff are great (along with the TAs of the courses), but part of me wishes I just went to a public university that was cheaper.",

I had two lectures in person and a lab in person, however, towards the end they were mostly put online since people in the course had COVID-19 and they were taking precautions.
