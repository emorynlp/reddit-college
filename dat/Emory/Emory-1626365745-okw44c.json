  "text": "I picked random for roommates since I did't really mind and when I checked my housing assignment today it shows that I got a double room but it says that I have no roommates, does that mean I just won't have a roommate at all or will I get one eventually? I'm just kinda confused cause I asked other people who also went random and they got assigned roommates so I was just wondering if it's normal to not get assigned one  \n\n\nEdit: was just a technincally error it seems, changed my date format to MM/DD/YY on my computer and it seems to work now",
