  "text": "Hey guys! I'm planning on majoring in NBB and Chinese on the pre-med track! This is 18 credits and I just wanna know if it's manageable? Is it possible to also go for Emory's Jazz Combos? Do any of you guys have previous experience with the jazz department? Also, I know a Chem lab on Monday isn't ideal but I signed up for the STEM Pathways' bio-chem cohort and that's the lab they gave. An 8:30 does sound bad but I've heard that Wakefield makes it worthwhile? Any advice would be amazing!! Thank you!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z0r3sog0r7f71.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=57261638235ea72edd315daa780c47899f305c06",

      "text": "I'm a rising junior, both pre-med and part of the jazz program (in a combo freshman year and big band last year) - this is possible and I did 19 credits my first semester but keep in mind that being in a performing ensemble is 1 credit and taking lessons is 2 credits for a semester. The music department allows you to overload the hypothetical credit limit but I would also be wary of doing so - this is 19 credits already and adding lessons and a combo would put you at 22, which I would say is too much if you intend on doing much else extracurricularly and still having as much free time as your friends. The difficulty of this schedule depends quite a bit on how much work your seminar is, but bio and chem are a good bit of work together and intro to ethics is a pretty difficult class too (that depends on the professor to an extent, though). Let me know if you have any other questions, and I'm happy to talk in more detail!",
