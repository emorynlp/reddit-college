  "text": "Dumb question but are the walls/doors thin at CRC? What's the noise level like at CRC? Can you typically hear your apartment mate when they're all the way in their own room or the apartment next door? My apartment mate and I are both really sensitive to noise when sleeping so we're curious and that's why we're trying to be in CRC with separate rooms.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Roommate noise is minimal assuming their door is closed and they aren't blasting musics since (in 2 person CRC apartments), the kitchen/living room is a buffer between apartments. You can hear whoever is next door if they're quite loud (think having a party). Also some noise from your upstairs neighbor is possible. If you live near a metal door in the hallway, that clanging can also be heard throughout the night as ppl come and go. \n\nGenerally, having your own room blocks most noise and unless you need it snowed-in-50-miles-from-civilization quiet, you'll likely be fine, unless you get a really inconsiderate next-door neighbor",
