  "title:": "Appealing Atlanta campus rejection? (Only got into Oxford)",
  "text": "Hey all. So I am at the end of my college applications process, and after being rejected from nearly all my schools (yikes), Emory is basically the only college I have been admitted to that I have any desire to attend. \n\nHowever, the problem is that I was chosen as a Spring admit for the Oxford campus, not the Atlanta campus that I actually wanted to go to. While I know it is a great school, I personally do not find myself too fond of Oxford for a number of reasons (small size, location, etc), and so I am thinking of writing to my admissions officer and appealing my admission decision to request that I can attend the Atlanta campus. \n\nAmong other things I am thinking of talking about the specific ways I feel like I would be a better fit to the Atlanta community (especially coming from an Oxford-like boarding school), how only in Atlanta would I have the ability to keep rowing on their crew team as a walk on, and how I have a good friend incoming to the Atlanta campus that I wanted to room with.\n\nI am just wondering if any of you know of this sort of appeal being done successfully before or how the school might approach this. Or if you have any advice for what I might want to tell the school in my letter also let me know.",

      "text": "If you buckle down, you can be on the Atlanta campus in 3 semesters. Plenty of folks attend oxford who would have chosen to start at the Atlanta campus instead, if they'd been admitted. If you were waitlisted at the Atlanta campus you can make an appeal but if you were rejected, it's time to ask yourself if you'd rather start at Oxford campus or attend a different university. I know it's disappointing not to get into your top choice, but the vast majority of emory students (atlanta and oxford) were in the same boat as you and ended up thoroughly enjoying their college experience!",
