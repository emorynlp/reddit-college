      "text": "As a current member of the orchestra, I can say that the auditions were pretty lax this semester due to the lack of people on campus to perform, but usually they are somewhat competitive (a lot more so for violins). I was able to play part time as a high school senior before the pandemic hit, and I can say with confidence that playing in the orchestra is a very exciting experience. Our conductor Dr. Bhasin, is really good at what he does.",
