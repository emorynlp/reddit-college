  "title:": "How is Emory Managing Relationships Between Students and Non-Student Neighbors? Research Project Question",
  "text": "Hi Eagles!\n\nI'm a student at UNC-Chapel Hill and I'm working on a consulting project for a business writing class. For our consulting project, we are working with the Office of Off-Campus Student Life and Community Partnerships to address the tensions between students living in historically marginalized/Black neighborhoods and the non-student residents in those communities. \n\nAs part of our research, my group and I are wanting to learn about how other colleges in the Southeast are dealing with this issue. So, to those of you at Emory, have you had to take any kind of training to learn about how to be a good neighbor? Have you had to learn about marginalized neighborhoods in Atlanta? What is Emory doing to promote good will between students and non-student residents in these communities? Any other information you have to share on the topic would be appreciated! Feel free to comment below or PM me. \n\nThanks for helping me out! I hope you're staying safe and well. :)",
