          "text": "I love bread coffehouse! heads up it is a christian ministry but they are incredibly welcoming people of all religions and faiths and won't talk to you about religion unless you want to. The coffee is really high quality too - you can get any expresso drink (I normally get a lavender oatmilk latte) completely for free from 12-5. Seriously the best and most welcoming people ever - I bring my laptop and study on their picnic tables all the time!",
