Then again, I'm taking it online so YMMV.\n\n\\- Not very math heavy, but very \"common sense\" heavy. It's more a research design course than a math course. All you need is simple arithmetic and algebra.\n\n\\- No coding, although knowing Excel helps when you need to make graphs.",

      "text": "The class is in between, it\u2019s not easy or hard. The material is mainly very abstract concepts of research design so you have to be able to understand and apply those concepts. I personably find it really interesting so it\u2019s a good challenge. \n\nI took the class in person and I think if you pay full attention during the lectures (trying to focus on the big picture instead of trying to take notes on every little point) then you probably don\u2019t need to put in more than 1-2 hours per week outside of class. \n\nThere\u2019s no coding involved at all.",
