  "text": "Dr Yue, Kim, and Moreno are all teaching ECON 212 next semester. I'm still unsure of who to take because of their ratings on rate my prof. I'm thinking about Dr Kim but have heard he is unreasonably hard. The problem is that to take Dr Yue I would have to give up another class I wanted to take - any guidance would be much appreciated!!",

      "text": "I also had Kim for Econ 220 this semester. Averages were probably mid-high Bs because he often gave credit back for exam questions if you showed why you got it wrong and how to fix it. Expect at least 10% lower for in person exams. He is a great person though and really wants the best for his students. The two midterms were a breeze for me but like the other poster said, the final exam was brutal and I miraculously also ended with an A. Tbh I\u2019m really not sure how he even evaluates that exam. Either way I strongly recommend Kim if you feel you can tough it out. Just show up everyday with enthusiasm for the content and willingness to learn",

He definitely lowered the grade boundary because I was at an A- before the final exam which did not go very well (I didn\u2019t attempt 20 points). I think he just looks at how much effort you put into class so if you attend office hours and are attentive in class, he\u2019ll grade you well. It definitely wasn\u2019t an easy class but he wasn\u2019t that bad, however, you need to get used to his accent.",

          "text": "Let me ask this:  Was he a bad teacher or did you just expect the course to be easier?  Because to me it is sounding like Kim runs an intermediate economics course up to par with schools that have more elite and rigorous economics undergraduate programs where many professors beyond intro don't just write easy tests where all of the items are \"familiar\" if you just practiced and were obedient(or maybe this IS what Kim wanted, perhaps too much).  60s-70s sounds sort of like a \"figure out this newer or semi-complex scenario\"(this is common among harder math and life sciences courses for example) situation for several items which I know students probably don't expect or are used to coming out of intro at Emory, but is maybe how it should be (admittedly a lot of people find econometrics or forecasting that way).  Now it is another thing if his teaching and lectures were incoherent, but it sounds like he was kind of just trying to challenge students which I hear still isn't but so common in Emory econ.  I imagine that can be frustrating if you believed intro was supposed to prep you for it (and you may have breezed through intro), but the frustration and not expecting that level may be a general weakness in Emory's program(like my understanding is that econ. 101 and 112 are now huge so most professors do \"not so challenging\" multiple choice only). My understanding is that 201 can be all over the place as well.",

              "text": "He was both, a bad teacher and the course should have been easier. My peers in the same course with another professor had a much more fair course work. I had also taken a challenging Econ 201 course where our exams were beyond intro and the test questions were items we had not seen before. However, that was fair and the professor was helpful. Prof Kim's was a different thing all together. Not only were his test questions items we had never seen before, but he was not helpful. The biggest issue was that many many students legitimately feared him. Other students, including myself, were scared to go to office hours because of how intimidating and mean he would be.   \n\n\nTo the OP, please save yourself if you can, and do not take his class. It's not worth it. I'm not one to just look for easy classes, but you're asking to have a very tough semester if you choose this class. That's all i have to say",

                  "text": "I think I'd worry about him being incoherent or mean (though I hear mixed things on that with Kim) because I don't like how we from the US k-12 system define \"fairness\" (and yes I'll take the downvotes for saying it as I usually do) because it usually means \"tests are just like the p-sets and p-sets are exactly like what was covered in lecture\".  I think there is value in forcing us to figure out more complex problems either in HW or on an exam. Curves and scaling are meant to sort of fix the fact that other sections may not try to challenge students in that same way(though lack of transparency in how it works can be a problem), but I'm in STEM so am highly biased (because I know that working in STEM entails improvising and suddenly adjusting to unforseen outcomes and challenges. I Imagine things like finance, consulting, and econ grad school can also be more \"random\"/open ended and sometimes you just get stuck or fail upon your first try).  \n\nI guess I'm just saying that students should more often anticipate assessments that assess a mix of knowledge and problem types you are kind of familiar with as well as some that test \"thinking on the feet\", especially at a top tier school.  Such assessments are sort of characteristic at places with the best programs with stronger outcomes and I think there is probably a reason for it(of course students who not only are knowledgeable and obedient, but nimble and adaptable to \"surprises\" are going to do extremely well in many high paying fields). Admittedly I do hear that people like Banerjee and some others have low averages sometimes and test similarly in 201 but they are known to be approachable and extremely effective teachers. That is the ideal combo IMO: Challenging in a non-cookbook/plug and chug type of way, and supportive as long as students put in effort. Kim sounds hit or miss depending on the personality of the student whereas a Banerjee is a universal hit whether he challenges students or not.",
