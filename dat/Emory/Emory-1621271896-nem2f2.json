My question is who actually lives here? Is it mixed undergrad/grad, to what degree are there other non-student living, any personal experiences or friends with anecdotes y'all have?",

      "text": "Fellow incoming grad student here. I toured Briarcliff a few weeks ago and asked a few people that question. In general it seems like it's mostly grad students/young professionals and families. Seems like there are a few undergrads but not that many. I'm guessing the distance from campus is a turn-off for underclasses.",

I don't know the frequency of the shuttles though, but it's definitely a factor that drives most undergrads to the other apartments like Reserve or Highland Lakes",

      "text": "Campus Crossings previously only accepted graduate students and working adults, with undergrads having a very hard time getting in. However, last year, after the start of the COVID pandemic, they have been more accepting of undergraduate students as well.\n\nThe main attractive point of CCB is that all of their apartment options come fully furnished, and their rent includes all utilities and fees except for power. It's a big plus for those of us who don't want to deal with the hassle of moving a lot of stuff/buying a lot of stuff and having to resell it. Only downside is the parking fee, which is $80 per month.",

Might be a drawback for someone who already has a roommate in mind, since they'll both have to be apply and be accepted separately, but can also be a benefit for someone like a new incoming grad student who doesn't know anyone and would like to be placed with a suitable, comparable roommate by CCB's roommate matching program.",
