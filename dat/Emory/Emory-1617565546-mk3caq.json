  "title:": "Prospective Oxford Student Q's abt Graduating Early, FinAid Negotiation + IB",
  "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nBackground\u2013 I was admitted into Oxford RD, but rejected from Emory. I'm looking to go into Finance (most likely Investment Banking). \n\nTop Choice Acceptances\u2013 Tulane ($15k scholarship), Emory Oxford ($0 scholarship)\n\nWaitlisted\u2013\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Boston College\n\nConsidering my career path of IB, I'm aware that Emory is a better choice (considered a target), but I'd also probably be in \\~$60-100k of student debt. I'm entering this assuming that Emory should be my top choice, but if anyone thinks that Tulane or any of the waitlisted colleges would be better (factoring in the price), please lmk.\n\nQ1) Graduating early. I've struggled to find any info online, so I'd REALLY appreciate any experiences, anecdotes, or general information on this (I'm very uninformed on how the credits overloading, etc. all works). It's important to land an internship sophomore year summer, so being on the main campus is my primary goal (unless any Oxford grads in IB have an experience of getting an internship @ Oxford soph year).\n\nQ2) FinAid. I think I got like $5k in loans from Oxford. I've heard of the idea of negotiating FinAid. Has anyone done this or have any tips/advice? Could I use my Tulane $15k scholarship as leverage to try and bump the price down, or is it improbable? If so, who would I call to negotiate with? Would love to PM more abt this.\n\nQ3) Clubs. I've heard of the abundance of leadership opportunities at Oxford, but I struggled to find any related to IB. I think I found like a Business Club (very vague) on the website, but nothing targeted at banking or finance. What clubs are there that would best suit my interest? Would it be feasible to commute to main campus to participate in club meetings related to banking/finance?\n\nLast, nuanced question\u2013\u00a0I just reached out to Emory's track coach. As aforementioned, my primary goal is to be on the main campus. I contacted him about transferring to main campus to run track, as Oxford doesn't have a track team. My times meet the walk-on criteria. Does anyone know if it's even possible to transfer over to Atlanta (i.e end of 1st semester, or end of freshman year) for athletic purposes? My times weren't good enough for recruitment, but I could easily walk-on, but not sure how transfer process would be like  (or if even possible).\n\nThank you SO much for your responses. I really appreciate it.",

      "text": "Emory is your best option for Finance our of all your acceptances and waitlists. CMU is close but Emory edges out in IB/consulting CMU wins in tech/quant. I think you can use your scholarship from Tulane when negotiating for finaid. I used mine too and I did get some aid but it was very less but managed to go from 0 to like 5k in merit aid . I can\u2019t help you much in that though because my dad did it. I think if you\u2019re gunning for IB then Emory for +15k a year is a better option than Tulane. The recruitment is definitely better",
