  "text": "hey y'all, I was just admitted to oxford and i'm stoked! i'm a little concerned about the social scene. i'm on the introverted side, which is why i loved the idea of the tight-knit oxford community, but i've heard that because of its size, it's very clique-y. can any oxford grads tell me about their experience (as brutally honest as possible)? is it easy to make friends?any input about the social atmosphere would be much appreciated! :-)",

Yes the \u201cdry\u201d policies but if your smart enough to get in your smart enough to figure it out. \n\nDon\u2019t even worry about the shuttles to Atlanta, if you do it right you\u2019ll never have to leave.\n\nI LOVE MY OC ",

      "text": "Hey, I'm a current first year, and trust me, making friends is zero problem. The orientation is the gateway to meeting people you'll probably spend most of your time with, and if not, you'll meet new people one way or another. I am best buds from 2 people from the group that I was assigned (called a PAL group). It does get kinda boring seeing the same faces everyday, but I like it since I kinda have an idea of the type of people I encounter. \n\nAs for partying, Oxford is very low-key due to being \"dry\", but you can always find something to do if you try, and all those types of guys take the ATL shuttle to have fun as well.\n\nThis place is honestly what you make of it, and if you have any other questions, hmu! \n\nCongrats on getting in !\n\n",

I did hear that Oxford can be high school-y because of its size, but I always thought of it as having a quiet LAC vibe w/o any party culture. I guess it\u2019s not really like that. I\u2019ll definitely keep your words in mind when I go and visit, but I\u2019m still trying to be optimistic!",
