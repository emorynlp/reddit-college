  "text": "Hello! I\u2019m a freshmen on the pre med track planning my four year plan and was wondering if i should take biochem. Would it be worth it and/or necessary to take both biochem I&II or just biochem I for MCAT prep\u2014-or not necessary at all? What are your thoughts. Also, would taking microbiology with lab be also helpful for MCAT prep?? Thank you!!",

      "text": "I'll PM you with details, but I feel like people get different tests depending on when they take it.  Generally the answer is yes for both.  However, it is more so about HOW and WHO those courses are taught by than whether you take them.  Simply learning content in those areas will not be sufficient and if you've taken them with low level instructors who only focus on content, you may as well not take them at all.  I've talked about this a lot on here,  but will PM you more about it.",
