  "text": "Hi, Hope everyone's well.\n\nI don't mean this question in a chance me sort of way, but just wanted to know if you have ever seen an international student getting need-based financial aid at Emory (context: my estimated Family Contribution is 15K USD/year)?\n\nIf the ans to the previous question was yes, could you please confirm if at least a few get it each year or a few get it once every 2-3 years? \n\nNote: Wasn't able to apply for merit scholarships due to some issues.",

      "text": "According to Emory, \u201cEmory\u2019s admission process is \u201cneed-aware\u201d for international students. This means that when reviewing applications, we must consider whether students who are not US citizens or permanent residents have requested financial aid and/or review their ability to pay for an Emory education.\n\nAs a result, there are limited funds to assist international students on the basis of need. Apply for financial aid only if you have no other resources to fund your education.\u201d\n\nhttps://apply.emory.edu/financial-aid/international.html\n\nI haven\u2019t come across an international student getting need based aid, but then again I don\u2019t really ask others about that. Most international students I see seem to be pretty well-off based on their fashion and how often they buy food/go out. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a chance though. But based on what I pasted from Emory\u2019s website they do take into consideration if you need aid which will affect your chances of getting in.",

Your best chance is getting a partial or full-ride scholarship through the Emory Scholars Program, and they don\u2019t select you if you apply ED1 or ED2. If you haven\u2019t applied for the Scholars Program, unfortunately you won\u2019t get all the aid you need. Trust me, I speak from my own experience.",
