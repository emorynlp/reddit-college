  "text": "There are some classes listed on the GER but are not even displayed in ATLAS (for instance, REL 350 and CS 190). I initially thought REL 350 was just not offered this fall. However, CS 190 is a first year Seminar class for CS students so I have a hard time believing it\u2019s not being offered this fall. So my question is: are these courses not being given this fall or will they show up later?",

      "text": "Chances are that if they aren't there now, they won't be offered this fall. Also I think that CS has not offered a frosh seminar in a while. If they aren't in the atlas there isn't a plan to offer them this semester.  Also, some courses are effectively defunct (like Religion 350) but they have yet to remove it from the big catalog or the course offerings displayed on departmental websites.",

              "text": "I would never get excited over a 190 because 190 is just a generic seminar listing and the seminar can suck.  Likewise, religion is a department with many excellent classes and has many  100, 200, 300 level courses worth a shot. They tend to be taught well and are intellectually stimulating.  There is plenty to get excited about. Keep an open mind, especially about courses in areas of study rarely offered to k-12 students.",
