  "text": "hey guys! i got my financial aid last week and am now realizing that it\u2019s still a bit expensive. I have an EFC of 0, and would have to pay 6k + insurance (which i think is 9k). Overall it comes out to nearly 10k. I want to appeal my aid because I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s doable for my circumstances but i don\u2019t know if it would be seen as unwillingness to pay. i don\u2019t think i necessarily qualify for special circumstances either. does anyone know if an appeal would be successful?",

      "text": "Certainly doesn't hurt to ask - if you are a US citizen, Emory likely assumed you already had health insurance through your parents. \n\nAre you currently completely uninsured? If so, you likely can find a less expensive health plan than Emory's through the ACA marketplace (available through Aug 15) or you may qualify for medicaid if you are not claimed as a dependent by any one (which you shouldn't be since it sounds like you aren't getting any financial support from your parents or guardians). \n\nJust make sure if you decide to purchase a plan separately that it meets emory's waiver requirements (For example, catastrophic health insurance would not qualify).",
