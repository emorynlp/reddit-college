              "text": "You may get lucky and get significant but smaller scholarships that actually more based upon need and or other niches you may fill.  Like the Liberal Arts Scholarships certainly go to a wider range of students and you don't have to be \"definitely super elite material\" stats wise or EC wise to get one.
