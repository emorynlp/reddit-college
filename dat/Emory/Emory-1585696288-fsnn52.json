  "title:": "CURRENT STUDENTS: Which clubs/orgs are most social?",
  "text": "Everyone knows that you don't have to join greek life to be part of a bigger social circle, people often cite some clubs as being good replacements for greek life. Current students: Was there a club/org you joined that fulfilled you socially?\n\nMight seem like a silly question, but there are plenty of clubs that end up doing nothing for their members socially! I want to know about the clubs that actually put in the effort of providing social experiences rather than just expecting that you'll meet some people with common interests.\n\nAn example of this might be a school newspaper that is known for lots of potlucks and some parties hosted by its members and open to the whole group, or a professional fraternity.",

They seem pretty social. If you\u2019re into sports, I heard club rugby is pretty tight. My friends in that club are always having a good time drinking, ripping cigs, etc.",
