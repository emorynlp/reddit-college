  "text": "I was wondering if it was mentally and physically possible to nab a bba degree from Goizueta while fulfilling all the premed requirements, interning, volunteering, and preparing for the mcat and gmat etc? I really doubt it because of Goizueta\u2019s grading policy and requirements but I\u2019m just wondering bc I\u2019m nervous about going pre-med fully since it\u2019s hard to find a well-paying job straight from college with a bio degree. I\u2019m really torn on which major I should go for and I\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019ll run out of time if I choose too late.",

      "text": "Not a stupid question, it\u2019s perfectly possible. Business majors generally need to have really high GPAs if they\u2019re looking for great jobs as well. What matters more is if you\u2019re actually interested in the courses you take and if you put in the work when preparing for your classes compared to your peers. There\u2019s even a few people who do math, pre-med and business well, which although seems extremely hard is possible if they\u2019re passionate in everything listed. In my opinion, adding math into the mix is much harder than biology, chemistry, or even biochem, much less business school courses like accounting.",

      "text": "Uhmm...you don't have to do a bio degree if pre-med (pre-med is literally just like 4 sequences of STEM courses and some volunteer and shadowing work med. schools ask you to do.  Also, many medical schools like those who participate in basic science and clinical research so be careful what majors you combine and ensure you'd be able to somehow fit that type of experience if considering any of the more research intensive medical schools which are a lot of them). You can choose any other science or non-science.  You can even stay in \"just business\".  I also think people as normal, over-rate the GPA requirements employers need students to meet.  They have to be strong, but I think most U.S. med. schools are more stringent on average.  Like many solid paying employers will readily take 3.5 of even 3.4+ IF you have experiences and competencies they want.   Med. schools love 3.6+ but especially love 3.7+.\n\nI do not fully agree with a poster above who suggested math would make it harder to maintain a higher GPA than the other STEMs.  Emory is a special place where departments like NBB and chemistry get a lot of \"love\" in terms of who teaches courses and how they are taught.  Math is very large and to keep up with enrollment they have had to heavily use visiting professors and whatnot meaning that quality control is low and you are more likely to run into a professor who could care less and will give students some really watered down stuff.  There is generally a lot of rigor in math, but that does indeed happen. \n\nYou may get lower quality instruction in exchange for a higher grade. Bio has a mix of grading and types of courses (for the MCAT, you'd want the ones students consider \"hard\".  The ones that get you to seriously use brain cells and not just benefit those with phographic memory) and would generally be easier than math even considering what I said.  NBB and chemistry have way more consistent rigor and quality across courses which is certainly a good thing overall, but means Emory students shouldn't go in expecting an easier ride than a math or CS (for one, generally students struggle more in courses that are interdisciplinary.  Think an NBB 301 or a physical chemistry course, where biological, physical, and chemical phenomenon are being modelled with math.  Applying math is different from just being good at coding or good at manipulating numbers, but doing so is obviously very valuable).\n\nBut as evidence, go look up some of the tenure and lecture track math professors at Emory on ratemyprofessor.  You'll notice that students in math at Emory have some \"strange\" expectations.   You'll see them complaining about instructors who yield a B- couese average.  I'm sorry, but that is typical in chemistry and NBB courses and it ain't because the kids are dumber. It is because most of the instructors care for students and aim to challenge them with the exams or p-sets fairly consistently.  So both have like 4-5 core classes that target that average whereas math is a free for all where students are clearly running into the really weak instructors who can care less and just get students to repeat exactly what is done in class or on homework problems for tests and thus tests yield high averages.  \n\nSo you end up with a contingent of these students reach a course that doesn't have high average tests and has a target GPA of B-, they are in shock or upset after having their egos massaged by previous courses (where they were convinced that they were learning and that the teacher was just good. See the trick).\n\nEven with all this said, students who enjoy chem and bio manage to do very well and usually get into medical school, even excellent/super top tier ones.\n\n*Note I do agree with another poster that you should be careful if you are merely chasing money and security by doing both these tracks.  Please think about what you really want to do and simply position yourself for solid post-grad opps and jobs through academic performance, experiential learning, and ECs.  You'd be surprised what you can convert into a well compensated job after undergrad.  Bio is often a problem, but mainly because a lot of bio majors do nothing but take courses and make whatever grade because they start off and even end as pre-med.  Of course if you only do that and what medical schools tell you to do for your ECs, you won't be particularly marketable to employers by time of graduation (take control of your education, do not view it as checking off boxes that the bio or whatever department requires or some narrow list of 3rd party evaluators, like a med. school for example, recommends).  Usually bio majors are averse to well...any STEM outside of biology (but especially quantitative and computational stuff, and this is a problem) when employers are looking for important interdisciplinary skills that you can pick up by say, taking CS courses, QTM courses (not just the stupid QTM 100 course) physics courses, anything that builds quantitative or computational problem solving skills that a wide range of solid paying employers want.  If Emory wasn't such a pre-med factory, I imagine the QTM biology and NBB track would have blown up like the social science tracks by now and you'd have the failed medical school applicants along with those taking a gap year for whatever landing a lot more softly because they'd be more marketable to a broader range of jobs coming right out of college.\n\nBut either way it isn't a bio (or any) major that is the problem so much as how most students approach it with tunnelvision and lack of foresight (please do more than just be obedient to whatever requirements. This is YOUR education).You don't have to have this and you can also think beyond the Big 3 (law, business, and medicine) pathways to end up in a lucrative career.  I don't know why Emory undergrads are just so wed to these.  A lot of the more super elite tier schools have plenty of students who have made their way to good paying careers outside of those areas.  I trust that you are as smart and creative as many and most of those folks are so use the intelligence and try to think outside the box knowing that most employers look for competencies and skills more than a near perfect GPA or a degree from HYS or something.",

One danger of doing these two paths together is that because so much of a schedule (maybe like 5 slots per semester) is taken up by b-school courses starting junior year, you may be unable to take the BEST biology courses, as in the ones that are most enjoyable intellectually, and the ones that train the best for the MCAT.  You might find yourself just \"checking off requirements\" or \"fitting in what you can\".  Having less control over professor and course choice could make it largely a waste of time and money.  I mean, I would go through some of the Fall 2020 and past (maybe spring 2020 or spring 2019) biology course offerings here: [https://atlas.emory.edu/](https://atlas.emory.edu/)\n\nAnd see if it has topics or course descriptions you are interested in and keep such offerings (as in beyond intro) in mind so that you have something (or someone-college course quality is so driven by professor quality) to look forward to and maybe plan into your otherwise GBS dominated schedule.",

                      "text": "That sounds good.  You don't really need to do extra prep work at all.  I am just making sure that you understand and want to learn biology as an EXPERIMENTAL and interdisciplinary science in college, vs. just \"a bunch of pathways and things happening\".   The latter is what most people expect in college because they haven't gotten very far in their k-12 life sciences studies or they had bad teaching (many will feel that unless a teacher is lecturing and jamming a bunch of facts down their throat and asking them to regurgitate those facts, then they aren't learning biology.  It is really sad, but that is the state of k-12 biology education for the most part).  A person with AP credit should pretty much get this, and hopefully the lab exposure helped you get exposure to data analysis/reading primary articles and whatnot.  You should theoretically be well equipped to take course based research courses (if you look at the fall 2020 course atlas, you'll see things like: the ecology lab, experimental evolution, microbial ecology research experience lab, and microbio lab.  All these are more research focused lab experiences with the first 3 being most like it.  You can cite some of the techniques that you learn from these on a resume or even discuss a final product or writing you did in them in cover-letters or interviews.  Generally you wanna take courses where you gain tangible skills) in the case you can't fit in a full undergrad. research experience, as well as take instructors who mostly focus on applying biology and learning techniques vs. just teaching you to take in and memorize \"stuff\" from a book or slides. And definitely try to expand your horizons try out some of the more quantitative biology courses.\n\nEither way, since you should be well-equipped, it is important to be able to fit these types of courses (and sometimes, one course will be taught the way I'm describing with one professor and then completely differently by another in another semester, so be careful!) and experiences into your schedule.  You could just go through and take garbage like human phys, biochem 1, and developmental biology, and even throw some more memorization oriented electives in after those, but you won't be as well prepared for the MCAT and may end up disappointed with your overall experience at Emory.  And honestly, it is over-indulgement with courses like those that makes a typical biology major a poor candidate for employment (employers assume that is what a bio major is and often rightly assume that they don't have well-developed quantitative skills, scientific reasoning skills, computational skills, really anything they want.  And I am pretty sure many try to apply to science jobs with no research experience or any experiential learning in the field so they pretty much just appear useless even if they have a high GPA).  Memorizing powerpoint slides just isn't a marketable skill to anything but a health professional school.",

              "text": "To be clear, the difference between the B-school grading and typical STEM grading at Emory (especially for the pre-med core courses) is that the B-school core courses will yield like a 3.15-3.3 course average which is fairly high, and electives 3.3-3.5:[https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/curriculum/standards](https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/curriculum/standards)\n\nSo \"weeder\" core courses are running up to a 3.3(B+) average in GBS, significantly more generous than the 2.7-3.0(B-/B) targeted by basically all pre-med core courses (\"gchem\" 1/2, \"ochem\" 1/2, bio 1/2, physics 1/2, and any math/QTM you must take).  You may find yourself needing to find some non-premed core STEMs (which typically grade more in the range of the b-school core courses) to pad your STEM GPA in case of an \"eh\" grade in one course, but have difficulty scheduling.  What I will say is that apparently MCAT is the number 1 thing most med. schools consider especially if you can maintain at least a competitive GPA (I would say 3.5+, but ideally 3.7+ overall, and as close to 3.5+ as possible for STEMs).  If you find it hard to find time to study for the MCAT, it would not be horrible to consider a gap year (I think a significant chunk of medical school matriculates do this anyway for a variety of reasons) and use that time to prep.   And I mention quality control (correct professor selection) of those core courses for a reason:\n\n[https://vimeo.com/332266552](https://vimeo.com/332266552)\n\n\\*The guy here (a Kaplan MCAT course instructor I believe) mentions how most students have to pretty much unlearn how to approach studying science/prepping for STEM exams for MCAT level prompts because many college level biology and other STEM courses mostly focused on repeating material or algorithms presented (basically some/many professors are almost TOO straight-forward in terms of the types of test items they write.  So barring the instructor that writes bad questions with inaccurate information, thank the teachers that give items that make you think/understand stuff beyond the surface level) vs. applying it to novel or convoluted/complex multi-concept situations.  The reality is that with good professor selection at Emory for the key subjects covered on the test, this doesn't have to be the case for you.  You can already be ready for the expectations and style of thinking needed for the test so it isn't so much of a hurdle to study (for example, maybe you could take a job in that gap year while you study, and it will be less over-whelming). Quality control of those 6 or so classes and high effort to do well AND learn the SKILLS stressed in them (not just the material-as highlighted in that video, you will experience limited rewards for just \"knowing\" stuff).",

I see where this person's post sounds harsh or condescending but believe it or not, I do see and hear a lot of Emory students who think that way or limit themselves to certain paths on either the \"I wanna help folks\" or the \"I just want security and money\" grounds.  Students should keep a more open mind about how they can do either or both IMO and I think that is what that poster is maybe trying to say.  There are not simply two paths to success and being able to help folks offered at Emory.  There are so many ways to do that, but sometimes you wouldn't think so.",

                      "text": "And there are other \"direct\" ways to be involved in healthcare or the community while making money AND there are many things people don't seem to understand about medicine (I think many see it as overly glamorous due to the media's portrayal and whatnot when there are lots of pit falls) get that but this combo always looks suspicious to me as a default sort of combo to do that at Emory and students need to be more creative and open minded to consider other ways to do any of those things.   \n\nWe often see what this is.  Student says \"I wanna help people directly so I'm pre-med\" and then they give up on this and themselves very quickly as soon as they hit a couple of \"eh\" grades in pre-med pre-reqs so they run off to the b-school where I pray they can also help people directly.  Maybe students should also get more creative with their backups as well.\n\nAnd we have to be real and recognize that there are \"some\"(maybe even plenty) folks who are NOT in it because they really wanna directly help folks.  At Emory there is some funny stuff going on where it looks like up to half of the pre-meds are being pushed to apply to med. school regardless of whether they are competitive or if their heart is in it and it ain't the PHA pushing them towards it. Among elites, there seems to be a uniquely Emory problem with this.  The admit rate into med. school is unusually low for this tier of schools and I don't think that is Emory's fault for not having a strong enough curriculum/not prepping people for the MCAT. The curriculum is actually quite strong (IF one is serious and takes their training serious, one knows who and what to take at Emory)",

I think a lot of us see what often happens with this combo (I'll admit to have known 1-2 people aiming to open their own clinic or planned to also get involved in healthcare administration, but still...), especially at Emory.  They seem to function as sort of default pathways almost and I seriously doubt that ALL (or even most) of the folks that start off as pre-health are just super passionate.  I hope the OP is, but evidence suggests that a huge proportion aren't from a) how easily they give up after a couple of Bs (and many go straight to the b-school, and it ain't to do social enterprise or things like that) in pre-med cores and b) how many will flat out admitting familial and parental pressures leading them to apply when they aren't ready (or even don't want to do it).\n\nAnd I personally never understood why people could rather flippantly consider pre-med (a very risky track) or something like bio/pre-med at Emory, but not also consider something like CS or QTM in addition to business or econ. as some back-up option (and now econ. has an official health-econ sort of major).  It is like people only have 2 track (\"I can only attempt tried and true pathways that Emory is super well-known for\".  No they don't.  There are some paths and skills that are universally marketable no matter which school you come from and they aren't limited to pre-med and business) minds of what to do (I also think people are overly obsessed with \"safety\" and being on well-paved paths where you are kind of told and coached through exactly what to do as you pursue a pathway.  In CS or anything else, one is left to do more research on career paths and make more independent decisions about what courses to take and what types of opps they need to engage to be competitive for a job).",

                          "text": "I am glad Emory has humanities pathways and Emory edge and all, but I honestly think STEM students and others need to be targeted and steered by these sort of professional development and academic pathway development initiatives. It is pretty clear that many Emory students don't know what else is out there other than the Big 3 tracks or have no idea how they can use Emory to access such alternative pathways so they stick to safety even if it is very likely to fail (which obviously means it ain't that safe).  You can actually do quite a bit in STEM that doesn't require graduate school or a super high GPA from undergrad.  And even if you choose grad. school, everyone knows that becoming an academic is tough now-a-days so grad.  programs have more or less pivoted towards targeting folks towards other well-paid and fullfilling pathways that use the degree.  It would be nice if more Emory students were into tech, biotech, or start-ups.  I think absence of engineering means that many are not constantly exposed to those as possibilities, but the right type of undergrad. training and some imagination even outside of engineering could lead to successful access to such pathways.\n\nEmory needs to fix some of this though and I don't know if they need to implement more initiatives or alter the recruitment strategies to somehow get more students who consider doing something different, or maybe both. This pre-med and pre-bus thing has severe limitations (like, Emory can't become a global powerhouse by just producing students who do big 3 professional tracks.  It needs influence and representation elsewhere to really develop a brand and familiarity with a broader range of employers) and the over-recruitment of pre-meds is giving Emory a bad look (even to prospective students considering STEM degrees.  They'll naturally look to places that have a larger track record of being the origin of PhD STEM graduates or even being the bacculaureate origin of students who went to various industries.  Why go to a place that seems to only cater to the pre-health crowd if they have other options that also have strong STEM curricula with honors courses and better support for those outside of pre-health?), because like half of the pre-meds shouldn't even be applying to med. school but do it anyway.\n\nThis also makes us constantly face stupid questions like: \"Why is Emory's med. school admit rate so low versus peers?\" when the problem is pre-dominantly some of the students and their parents vs. the curriculum (I think Emory's curriculum is pretty strong, but just as you have some pre-meds who run to the b-school ASAP, you have others that refuse to be weeded out or refuse to plan a longer pathway even after 2.5-3 years of struggling in not the \"I occasionally got some B or B+s\" way, but the \"I take the easiest instructors for all the cores and still didn't do that well in them, but still plan on taking the MCAT and will use even a middling score to apply to med. school\") and advising. Anyone who takes the right courses and professors, and does well-enough GPA and MCAT wise pretty much gets in, and this applies whether you go to Emory or elsewhere. The game is really to only have those who are most ready to apply, do so as opposed to feeling as if it is some duty to apply and get into med. school at all costs.",
