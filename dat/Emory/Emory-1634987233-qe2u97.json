Elective choices are more limited relative to a school like GT, but they also have an entire college of computing, and I enjoyed all my electives regardless.\n\nThe faculty tends to be big on AI/NLP/Data Science if that's your thing, and the electives reflect that.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions you might have.",

              "text": "I don't think they struggle with jobs anymore but what I would keep in mind is that there are only a few privates (even among elites) with very strong CS programs.   It is mostly large highly/very selective publics that have ultra strong curricula (like even many T10 privates are trying to keep up with these places and will copy off of them by offering watered down versions of their analogous courses.  And the elective offerings still aren't close) and super robust professional development infrastructure that intentionally funnels students into internships.  At the other schools/privates like Emory and most of its near peers, you're talking very average curricula, rigor somewhat tailored to a more well-prepped crowd (versus rigor definitely meant to make you the most hardcore programmer at a place like Tech, Berkeley, Urbana-Champagne, CMU, Stanford, MIT. I may actually add Rice. Strong HPC related infrastructure and oppurtunities).  I'd say they've gotten better in the curricula part (they just rearranged it) and have a lot more momentum on student empowerment which likely has improved the job search process, but you still always have to be independent and are mainly leveraging your connections to faculty/the calibre of the school overall, willingness to take on personal projects and learn code outside of class that would allow you to pass screening challenges.\n\nHowever if you want to be a data analyst, the QTM department has much stronger professional development (with an intentionality that matters) infrastructure in and out of class to train you for that.  You can do a concentration there and maybe double major in CS (the math pre-reqs overlap a bit) or use the informatics major via QTM and take additional CS classes.   QTM is clearly trying to have professional development infrastructure that more so mirrors the b-school (very robust) than other ECAS departments AND they will be getting continued investment in all of that with this new campaign.  You may want to look into what that department offers and how it operates.\n\nIf you want to become a hardcore programmer, seriously consider a CMU, Stanford/MIT as reaches and many of the CS programs at places like Michigan, Georgia Tech, Berkeley, Urbana-Champagne,  etc (maybe even UCLA which has a ridiculous data science arm for UGs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yes research ops are available.   Jinho Choi's research projects have gotten an awful lot of interest lately (at the national level):\n\n[https://www.cs.emory.edu/events/news/#news284](https://www.cs.emory.edu/events/news/#news284)\n\nand they seem to get selected for a high yield competition almost every year (and won 2 years ago! Beating Stanford's team by quite a bit) and he takes undergrads.  Emory and key depts including CS are really leaning into AI related research and the university is investing in it, so that will definitely become a strong area.  Co-ops?  That sounds like that is more common at CS programs hosted within engineering schools at the publics I alluded to.   Don't get obsessed with these top tier privates if you wanna do STEM, especially CS.  At the UG level, most of them excel in life sciences at least (maybe because most are attached to healthcare systems and end up being pre-med factories), and of course many of the super elite schools have very strong math and physics departments, but CS seems under-developed/just trying to keep up at most of them. On the prof. dev side, there are places outside of the highest ranked privates great at it.  Like Northeastern has a really good model that seems to be working.",

                      "text": "Privates have the funding \"theoretically\"(for undergrad and grad programs generally but not necessarily a CS program) but publics benefitted from lots of government investment in such areas back in the day.  Some privates like Stanford were fortuitous and well positioned to get in on that phase (no one wants to acknowledge how Silicon Valley was basically a damned government start up).  Today most privates (especially \"newer\" elite tier research universities even more so than Ivies) have an extreme bias towards biomedicine and healthcare systems and hoards of funding go towards that and Arts and Sciences units that can sort of be tied to all of that. May be hard to reverse those patterns unless they can of course find a way to directly tie a CS dept to healthcare (which isn't necessary at a place like Emory where public health may have its own infrastructure to serve those purposes).  \n\nBut you never know.  There is talk at Emory of venturing into AI which I believe requires investing in CS among other disciplines. And Emory is following patterns of other elite (with standard CS programs) schools with growing enrollment and currently going on a hiring spree. I suppose Emory and other non-elite CS programs can market it as an \"expansion\"(and I have seen such marketing by some peers), but it is probably largely reactionary. They have to keep class sizes down and fit the spaces they currently have.",

There some good private cs out there that not top 10 like steve institute, rpi, rit, but that only because they only invest into stem. Emory looks pretty compare to other. Since they are the most richest school in the south, I dont think catching up would be a problem for them.",
