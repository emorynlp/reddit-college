  "title:": "professor having me write my own reccomendation",
  "text": "I asked one of my professors (from an Econ class I took last year) to write a letter of recommendation for an upcoming scholarship. He said he would be overjoyed to write it, as i was one of the top performers in the class and I spent a pretty good amount of time in office hours asking good questions and generally getting to know him. He later emailed me back with the template for the recommendation and basically said that I could fill it out myself and he would sign off on it because he trusts me to write a good one. \n\nKinda confused and lowkey annoyed though - it's WEIRD to write about myself, and don't want to brag too much but I also want a good letter of rec!  Should I just ask another teacher? What should I write?",

      "text": "Write exactly what you think set you apart from your peers. It's kind of hard in a class setting, especially a big class as most would be differentiated by GPA and not exactly anything else. If you did a project or presentation, you could write about how well it went, or how above and beyond it was. If your interactions during office hours let him know a bit more about your work ethic, write about that.\n\nI wrote my own letters to get into Emory for two of my recommenders. It was an online school from a different state and it was hard to get to know professors, but I needed academic letters. I also wrote my own awards in the military, mostly due to supervisor laziness and difficulty getting them approved.\n\nIf they're offering to start with a template, write it. Consider having to waive seeing the final letter so you don't get to see any changes they make. Chances are, they'll either add or make some changes anyway to suit what they really think.",

      "text": "This is honestly super common practice for letter writers tbh, I wouldn't bother asking someone else. Maybe ask them for an example letter so you have something to base it off of, or just look for some online.",
