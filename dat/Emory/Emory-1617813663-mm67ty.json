  "text": "Unfortunately, I will be transferring to another university after this semester at Emory. I doubt anyone who has transferred will still be on this subreddit (lol), but I was wondering if anyone happens to know what I need to do on the Emory side of things? Is there somebody I need to contact and let know that I am transferring? Or do I just not register/sign up for/etc. for anything next year?",
