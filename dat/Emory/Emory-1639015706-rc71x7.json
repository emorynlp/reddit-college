Emory's econ dept is well known for pumping out data analysts b/c of their focus on empirics. I would recommend the new dual Econ/CS program or even Econ/Health.",

IMHO though if you arent set on economics think about going to the B-School Goizueta has a great reputation for job placement. \n\nAlso job offers will come if you put in the work and don't slack off, don't let your GPA slack it will bite you in the ass at some point",

You can get the same prospects from Econ plus some more data oriented roles. For the most part a bachelor\u2019s degree is more than enough unless the job specially requires a masters degree",
