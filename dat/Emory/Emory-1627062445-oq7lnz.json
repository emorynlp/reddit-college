          "text": "I\u2019m not sure if the 1546 includes Oxford though. It probably doesn\u2019t though because I got this off the canvas module given to Emory main students. If that\u2019s the case then they seem to have  about 150-190 more students than they do in a regular year. Apparently Oxford has overenrolled by 80 people. Honestly I don\u2019t know if this is too bad. They don\u2019t need to decrease enrollment of the future classes by a lot. They can divide the loss into the next 3 batches which shouldn\u2019t cause much more competition",

I worry that they forgot how many deferred or are increasing enrollment as a temporary financial solution.  Just pray it doesn't affect academic quality.",

I don\u2019t know what they were thinking this year. They admitted almost an equal number of people to ECAS as they did Oxford. I believe that they made some mistake in their calculations because I don\u2019t think the pandemic affected the university enough for expansion",

                      "text": "I think it did affect it but they just try not to talk about it.  When they had to send people home, many of the elite privates WERE in financial crisis because they are very tuition and fee dependent. It upended a lot of things. And the deferrals hurt too.  That plus a desire to enhance yield may have led to this. And I am more worried about ECAS than Ox. Ox may have issues with space but you can do the same stuff with a 40-45 person course that you can with a 30 person course but teaching 2 sections of say a STEM intro or econ intro and going from 90 per section to like 120-140 or something can have a significant effect on how you wanna run the course because quality is more than just how nice their slides are or how clear their explanations are. It's usefulness of assignments, calibre of those assignments and other assessments, and maybe even quality of feedback if there is any writing assignments or project/case based learning.",
