  "text": "hi everyone! i'm genuinely confused about this so I would appreciate any input. now that we, freshman, have received our housing assignments, we have to choose a move in time slot. all of the slots are 30 mins each. my understanding is that in those 30 mins, you bring in all of your luggage and you and your parents set up as much as you can. but, honestly, how much can be done in just 30 minutes? say I sign up for the 11:00 to 11:30 slot, after 11:30, do we leave our parents and just stay in the dorm and they leave? or do we stay with them for the rest of the day?",

      "text": "Emory just makes students sign up for time slots so everyone doesn't move in at the same time. Your parents can stay for as long as they want in your room and on campus. I would just say try to at least bring all your luggage into your room during your time slot so you don't use the moving bins during other people's time slots. There will be orientation leaders, RAs, and SAs to help you with that. After you bring all your luggage to your room, you and your parents can stay in your room to clean, move furniture if needed, and organize as long as you want. You can probably even leave your room, grab lunch, (go to target, publix, costco if you want) and come back to your room to move in. I would say try to be quick moving in because you will have a roommate who also needs the space to move in as well. Good luck and get excited for move-in and orientation!",

Meal plans also begin on the day of move in so you'll be able to eat in the dining halls for lunch and dinner. Some parents leave right after they help their kid move in so they can hit the road back home. Some people choose to stay another night in a hotel with their parents if they are staying in Atlanta for another day. It's all up to you.",
