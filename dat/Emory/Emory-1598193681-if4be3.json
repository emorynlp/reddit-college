  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman on campus right now, and I feel like the only people I can talk to are people in my residence hall. I kind of want to meet other people, but it seems hard to with the restrictions imposed by COVID.\n\nDo you guys have any ideas as to what I could do? Will  that just happen naturally with clubs and classes, even if they\u2019re online?",

      "text": "No idea what the situation over on campus is right now, but you\u2019ve pretty much got it. Join clubs and interest groups. Also, if you can, make study groups of people living in ATL in your classes and meet them in outdoor places to study. I\u2019ve already been PMed a couple times in zoom for reasons like that and as a freshman there\u2019s no reason to feel uncomfortable doing that if someone is asking good questions in class and you\u2019d wanna study with them",
