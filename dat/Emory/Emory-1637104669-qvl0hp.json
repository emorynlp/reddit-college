  "text": "So i just signed up for my Spring semester and I got onto a Waitlist for HIS 239, and fortunately enough I'm 1st on it. However, there's only 10 spots in the class and it's a really good professor so it filled up quick. Also, I want to be on the waitlist for Film 101 which has a waitlist that'll open up next Monday, but then i'd be over the 19 credit limit if I get into both. so my questions are, is it likely I get into HIS, and will OPUS not allow me to be on both WLs? any help is appreciated!",

      "text": "1 - i think its pretty likely ur gonna get into the class, even if its only 10 people - a looot of people are dropping classes during ads\n2 - opus will only let you enroll in 19 creds including waitlist classes so you wont be able to enroll in both waitlists - you would need to choose one over the other.",
