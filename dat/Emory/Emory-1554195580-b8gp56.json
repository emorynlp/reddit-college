From my observation, the draw of oxford is that you get many opportunities to showcase your work through poetry writing contests, the one act plays, etc. There are also a lot of really cool classes (creative poetry writing, prison memoirs) that allow you to build your skills. Furthermore, a lot of the faculty have more time to read your work and give you feedback. ",

As for creative writing, Emory university has the best creative writing program in the country. Oxford is tricky because they only offer two creative writing courses, but the English offerings at Oxford are excellent, and half of the creative writing major (5 of 11 classes) are English courses, with the other 6 being the creative writing courses. I used to be a creative writing major, but I switched to something else so if you have any questions about Oxford or creative writing at Emory you can send them my way",

Yeah - I\u2019ve always heard it\u2019s the best in the country so I applied (though I looked up the ranking on Niche earlier today and it was a little lower than I expected). But last night I kind of fell in love with the creative writing department. I watched Jericho Brown\u2019s ted talk and read all his poems and I\u2019d just love to be taught by him. He also just seems like a really nice dude too. Have you had any classes with him? Or does he only teach at Emory? \n\nIn your opinion, what makes Emory\u2019s creative writing program the best in the country? I did get waitlisted at Oxford, so unless I get in off the waitlist, Emory is where I\u2019d go (even though he English at Oxford does sound really amazing).\n\nAlso, just out of curiosity, why did you switch from Creative Writing and English to Physics? That\u2019s a bold move! Also, do you enjoy every day life at Emory? Are you really happy that you\u2019re there? Do you wish you were anywhere else?\n\nThank so much for replying and being so open about your experience! You can pm me if you\u2019d prefer to :)",
