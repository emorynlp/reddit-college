  "text": "Hi there,\n\nI'm actually a KSU alum, but I am familiar with Emory being an Atlanta native and my mom has worked there my whole life. I heard about this incident that took place back in April on the Emory Quad:[https://emorywheel.com/autism-awareness-display-vandalized-on-emory-quad/?fbclid=IwAR1OEDQAzPLMAIfMEPUTKJb\\_81dgeQ2mLqM8fZWQm7KsnnpZ8vGGUh-XLdY](https://emorywheel.com/autism-awareness-display-vandalized-on-emory-quad/?fbclid=IwAR1OEDQAzPLMAIfMEPUTKJb_81dgeQ2mLqM8fZWQm7KsnnpZ8vGGUh-XLdY)\n\nTL;DR, an autism organization not ran by autistic people that used to be a chapter of Autism Speaks U, which is an extension of Autism Speaks, a very controversial organization, held an event at the beginning of April to celebrate Autism Acceptance Month, and a few students were disgruntled with this because they thought that the student organization had not truly changed and their event was purely performative. They sabotaged the event in response.\n\nWhat I'm curious about is not necessarily who was responsible, I'm not a cop, but I am wondering if there is a neurodiversity organization led by autistic people at Emory or if there is one being formed? I think that would be a healthier way to counter the Autism Awareness Organization. I've looked at their website and social media and yeah, they seem pretty awful to me as an autistic person who is well versed in the Neurodiversity Movement. Despite no longer being an Autism Speaks U chapter, their leadership still supports them and is even personal friends with them, which to me is problematic. There are other issues with them, but supporting Autism Speaks is pretty bad by itself.\n\nI would rather see a different organization altogether on campus that is built by autistic and otherwise neurodivergent students from the ground up. I also bring this up because I ran my own student organization for a year related to neurodiversity and am still serving them as chairman. Every college should have a neurodiversity alliance. I would love to support any efforts to start one at Emory.\n\nIf you are involved with the AAO and are reading this, I am not meaning to attack you, despite major disagreements I have with the way you do things.  I just think that autistic people on your campus/alma mater deserve to start their own organization.\n\nIf you need any clarification, feel free to ask me any questions you may have. This could end up amounting to nothing, I want to see if there is any way I can help autistic students at Emory as an autistic person myself.",

          "text": "I did see that. Honestly, I don't really care what they do as an organization. They're built on a shaky foundation. I think it'd be better for autistic and neurodivergent people to build their own organization independent of them from the ground up. Maybe even a general disability self-advocacy organization.",
