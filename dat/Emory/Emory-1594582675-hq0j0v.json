I\u2019ve already had to withdraw from 111 once at Oxford so I\u2019m pretty scarred by the course already and any insight on these profs would be great \n\n- Jack Barlow\n- Ru Huang \n- Yuliang Ji \n- Kelvin Kan\n- Christopher Keyes \n- Juan Villeta-Garcia\n- Marcelo Sales\n- Dylanger Pittman\n- Haozhe Yu \n- Xiangxi Gao\n\nThanks!",

I still work with him as a Learning Assistant for MATH 111 and I can say that he really does care about the students even though it might be harder than how it used to be. Also, just a side note: I had Dylanger for Calc 2 and he really is a great guy but his teaching style just isn\u2019t that great imo\n\nExtra side note: Juan is the only one that isn\u2019t a grad student as well",

              "text": "At least for Calc 2, Dylanger had already prepared notes before class then in class he would basically narrate word for word from those notes as he writes them on the board, so all class you\u2019re trying to understand all the content as well as write all the notes down at the same time before he moves on. He also had trouble actually explaining problems because he would just describe what he\u2019s literally doing without really explaining why he\u2019s doing it and connecting it all together, overall I think he just has some trouble with putting into words what he\u2019s thinking. He also had a bit of a stutter so that didn\u2019t really help either. I just found myself having to go to the textbook a lot during the semester to actually understand all the notes I wrote down in class. But as I said before, he\u2019s an extremely nice and friendly person who will always lend a hand if you ask, a lot of students liked him for his personality.",

Sound familiar? \n\n*Boy have things changed just by bringing him in. They used to make all the intro. calc. classes a cake walk with raw(before scaling) averages in the 80s or higher and would sort of just repeat the HW and pset questions on an exam. I'm guessing that due to QTM students needing to be able to use the math background throughout the major, they  decided to get someone like him to make the courses more consistently rigorous.",

He probably just wanted to push students to deal with more realistic problems.  You probably complained in the moment but can thank him later lol.  The most elite schools are known for those types of tests being very common in STEM and they do a damned good job producing good academics, doctors, etc.  As long as most folks get an A or B after scaling, y'all will live",

The others are grad. students and are wildcards, with some maybe being less effective (before tests were standardized, the weaker grad. students/those maybe too busy for teaching at a high level could just give unusually easy tests to avoid trouble. Now that is obviously not the case. A less effective instructor means students are more likely to underperform or find the tests too hard. And it is possible that everyone is fit to the same curve/final grade scale because the tests are the same).",
