  "text": "Coming in as a junior transfer due to credits (but im younger) this fall and wondering about Harris Hall. Is it noisy because its right across from the hospital? Does it seem secluded? Overall rating in comparison to upperclassman dorms? I was told I may be able to be placed in Harris because of my age but I can also choose junior dorms and I'm not rlly sure which is best! Does anyone have a pro's and con's list? Thanks!",

      "text": "Harris is pretty alright - not that amazing. Advantage would be that it\u2019s on campus but it\u2019s dorm style living and would have mainly sophomore students.\nI would recommend moving into the Claremont campus, it\u2019s apartment style living and it\u2019s where all the juniors and seniors live on campus. I\u2019m not sure about the deadlines though, I believe Claremont housing application has closed but could be open since you are transferring.\nI\u2019m a rising sophomore who\u2019s gonna be living at Claremont next semester. Hit me up if you wanna know more about Emory and Atlanta!",

          "text": "I think for a transfer student living in harris might be preferrable because it'll be easier to meet people and get involved on campus. Juniors and seniors on clairmont have don't have problems staying connect/having a social life becuase we've already joined clubs/frats/ect and found friends when we arrive. I think it could be kind of isolating for a transfer student.\n\nAgreed though that if quality of the dorm/apartment is your criteria, Clairmont housing is undoubtedly nicer.",

      "text": "I lived in Harris this year. It\u2019s pretty normal but the location is great. I think it\u2019s better than Claremont imo because you don\u2019t have to take a bus to get to campus. If you want to be with other Juniors/Seniors and like a higher quality of dorms, Claremont might be better though.\n\nIt\u2019s not that noisy. You hear the occasional ambulance, but it never lasts more than 15 seconds and I\u2019ve never been woken up at night by them. I wouldn\u2019t say Harris is secluded either. It\u2019s right next to complex (which is 3 residence halls) and the business school, and 1-2 min away from the library and Cox.",
