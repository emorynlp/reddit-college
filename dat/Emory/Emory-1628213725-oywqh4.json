I'm potentially going to double major in chemistry and creative writing.

      "text": "You should definitely register for all 19 of these credits (because ideally you would be able to sit in all of these classes\u2014except the lab) & be able to decide if they are a great fit for you. Many students end up changing their mind because they don\u2019t like something with the class. However, you should consider dropping to 14-16 credits sometime before the end of Add/Drop/Swap since this coming semester will be an adventure for everyone. Try to have a balance between all subjects. Hope this helps!",
