  "text": "How goes the political discourse on campus? I know Emory is generally a liberal/progressive community and I'm fine with that. I just wanted to make sure people are open to hearing different points of view and letting people whom they disagree with speak.\n\nI recenty found the Emory Whig instagram page. I was abhorred at the attacks on character in the comments, and the seeming unwillingness to read the articles with an open mind. Although I do not agree with the majority of the opinions on the whig, it seems easy for me to understand where they are coming from. Overall, the whig was attacked vigorously over just it's existence.\n\nDo you believe this is from a vocal minority? If so, how much do they dictate the conversation? Otherwise, where do you believe the leanings of the silent majority lay? \n\nAs someone who wants to be exposed to different perspectives, this is a matter of great concern for me.",

      "text": "Well. As you attend college, you begin to realize a lot of people are very vocal about their beliefs, especially on social media. In fact, a lot of people who may seem like keyboard warriors trying to shove their beliefs upon others on social media, may tend to act with more decency when meeting people face to face because on social media, you're not really seeing a human being with an opinion. You're just seeing an opinion. that being said,  as long as you're coming from a position that isn't condescending towards others, you won't be harassed for your views. \n\nwe live in a society where it's very hard for people to be even in the middle. but, It's honestly easier to be silent, smart, or aware about what you say in certain social conditions. There is a time and place to say certain things depending on the people you're with. But, I also can't tell you to keep your views to yourself. There is still freedom of speech, which everyone deserves. You should always be wary of what you say and the tone you're using and how you convey what you're saying to others.",

              "text": "As I said before, just be wary of how you share your views. Personally, I'm moderate but more liberal leaning, especially in recent years, so I haven't really had to struggle with facing backlash about my views from Emory students. I've faced it from others not at Emory, and I just ignore them. However, not everyone has thick skin, but I assume that if you're bold enough to share your views, then you'll be bold enough to face the repercussions of sharing views that don't side with the majority.  the truth is there are probably more moderates or conservative-leaning people than you think there are at Emory.\n\nThe safest option is even when you disagree with the majority, just don't sound condescending and people won't care. It's best to always RESPECTFULLY disagree if you have to. I've made friends throughout my life, who I've disagreed with politically.  If you have questions on how best to share your views, feel free to pm me.",

It\u2019s also inaccurate to label Emory as super left considering many students and professors support Israel/Zionism (there\u2019s a Zionist club and Israel-supporting organization). It\u2019s always funny seeing these types of posts at Emory because I have never found it particularly liberal or radical at all. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be worried about feeling \u201coppressed\u201d as a moderate/conservative; you\u2019re in good company and you have a lot more in common with your liberal peers than you think.",

Liberalism is common on college campuses and generally while it can be annoying in some ways (lots of lipservice and tone policing of interpersonal interactions and convs vs. focus on policy), it is certainly not \"radical\".

Willow didn\u2019t condemn those actions or provide any disapproval of saying the n word. Their comment is also extremely false and it isn\u2019t common at all on campus to do this so this perception must be one Willow holds. Regardless, saying slurs or implying that they\u2019re commonly used without condemning or showing disapproval is not tolerated Bc that\u2019s not political thought; it\u2019s blatant disrespect towards human rights. \n\nAlso, stop overreacting about my comment. Anyone could\u2019ve wrote extremely horrible things; I was pointing out a fact. Willow\u2019s lack of condemning the action speakers louder than the actual words they wrote. That mentality is the worst one to have because it provides the notion that it\u2019s \u201cokay\u201d and \u201cnobody cares\u201d when in reality, it\u2019s absolutely not. \n\nIf you think Willow\u2019s comment is not concerning and is something to \u201cgive thought too\u201d then maybe Emory is not for you. Even though people can be open minded, the use of slurs is not tolerated and it\u2019s common sense. It doesn\u2019t need to be given perspective or thought.

I fully reject the notion that it's a \"human right\" not to hear a specific word. And it's even more silly to think it's disrespectful towards \"human rights\" because you think that there is an implication that think it's an action he wouldn't care doing.

How many levels of purity testing can you do?\n\nThird of all, no, you were not pointing out a fact. You basically just insulted him. You didn't point out his implication or why he's wrong. You didn't try to understand his intentions, rather assumed the worst of what he could have meant. And I don't know if you realize this but he never implies it's okay to say the N word.

If you can\u2019t handle a person challenging your arguments and perspective, then I stand by my previous statement regarding your belonging at Emory. \n\nAttacking me and saying I have no idea what human rights are is just hilarious. Considering I have my rights constantly violated throughout the course of a given month, I\u2019m well versed on what constitutes as human rights violations. I\u2019m arguing that being tolerable of racial slurs and derogatory terms is a violation, not simply hearing them. Does it not violate my rights if I\u2019m being told I\u2019m the n word? Isn\u2019t that a violation of my being? Isn\u2019t it wrong for someone to just be okay with this violation and not condemn it? Being an enabler is just as bad as being the wrong do-er.\n\nLet me also point out that you complete missed my argument in that Willow\u2019s opinion lacks the key piece of disapproval in his comment. Replace the \u2018n word\u2019 with something else and see how that sounds. \u201cNobody cares if someone is sexually assaulted in private.\u201d How does that sound to you? The fact that Willow didn\u2019t add \u201c...which is disgusting/horrible/sad\u201d shows that this opinion Willow holds is the status quo that he also believes in. This is the mentality I am calling out and disagree with. Saying \u201cin private\u201d is literally just a location. He could\u2019ve said \u201cat the quad\u201d \u201coutside of campus\u201d etc.\n\nWillow\u2019s comment uses wording that promotes ignorance and is a completely false opinion. Unless they clarify what they mean, it is normal for a person to assume the worst because it is human nature. It is a flaw which I understand I take responsibility for on my part. However, I complete stand by my argument and opinions on why the mentality of thinking that \u201cnobody cares about saying slurs in private\u201d is not okay and is not an opinion that should be tolerated. I never personally attacked Willow or made any direct comments about his physical self. I simply called out his mentality, which could\u2019ve been held by anyone else. Stop overreacting and trying to make me out as a villain.",

What do you mean by comeback?\n\nI think republicans had enough of cancel culture only against them and crusading on the left so they adopted it too. This phenomenon isn't exclusive to it though. I believe something similar happened with the advent of the term 'super straight which was originally supposed to be a joke I'm sure. Democrats sorta did it too though. In 2016, they hated Trump's rhetoric and thought it despicable. But at this point, it feels the Left has adopted such poor rhetoric as well.\n\nI think generally this happens when one side feels like a dirty-handed tactic is used against them, and they start losing, so they decide to start using it too.\n\nFor the record, though I dislike labels, if I had to box myself in, I'd consider myself a radical centrist.",

We're spending time over arguing whether people should be using a slur in \"private\" or whatever (the question should be-why are people so desperate to use this or then argue argue over the \"right\" to use or care about usage of that word in any context minus reading from a book or journal artical after its been made clear by the offended that they don't like you using it for obvious reasons. White people and non-blacks seem to be obsessed with this \"right\" for some reason. Just can't think of why that would be so) which shouldn't be happening.  I won't be having the argument with you but you can type away.  I like typing away too just not on this type of issue.\n\n\n-Also I don't care about your records, what you dislike, or your \"label\".  You're just wrong.  I don't care if you said you were a liberal, Leftist, whatever. Weirdos exist across the whole spectrum including those who want to type, refer to themselves, or play around with empty words like \"radical centrist\". May as well type \"I stand for nothing\" (radical at being the center of what exactly? If an issue came up where each U.S. political party in the U.S. was deciding whether they should  where black or white Klan sheets at a swear in ceremony, I guess you'd say \"they should compromise and wear grey\". I don't know but do you and label.yourself whatever).",

                              "text": "Initially, I wasn't planning on keyboard warrioring some more, but perhaps this warrants a response given the amount of attention this thread has received.  \n\nYeah, I'm doubling down on the idea that you don't understand human rights. Then again, in this day and age, the term \"human rights\" has been so watered down that perhaps it doesn't mean much of anything anymore. I'm not going to argue this point further, as I doubt I can change your mind through a wall of text on the internet, though I suggest you look into the philosophy and basis for human rights in general. \n\nThe reason I belabor this point is the same reason why you commented on Willow's: because there's something the other person did that we vehemently disagree with. I despise poorly thought-out ideas, especially when someone attacks another on its basis. The difference is that you attacked a series of assumptions about his mentality you made about a vague comment. He had said so little that guessing his mentality was grasping at straws. While he stated something that is factually untrue, your response: \n\n\"Ur mentality is literally everything that\u2019s wrong with our school and society\". Seriously? \"literally everything that's wrong with our school and society\"? \n\nThat is also not true. It is not \"literally everything that\u2019s wrong with our school and society\"  You're crusading against a poorly based assumption on a person.\n\nYour analogy on sexual assault falls through. Let me first clarify I haven't said the N word since elementary school. It's not a part of my vocabulary, nor do I have any intention of making it so. That said, I reject the notion that saying the N word in any circumstance is inherently wrong. Assault by definition infringes ones' natural rights. A racial slur only causes damage when the other person it's used on understands the connotation and receives it in that manner. \n\nAnd PLEASE do not say \"it causes damage by creating a culture which makes it more likely into another situation\" or anything of the sort. A facilitator is not even close to being as morally culpable as the perpetrator. A knife manufacturer is not morally culpable for a random knife stabbing. Nor is the retail store morally culpable for buying the knife from the manufacturer and selling it to the perpetrator. \n\nNow I agree with you Willow's comment was poorly thought out. He should not have left his comment as vague and misleading as he did. However, that is not a reason to make assumptions about his actual beliefs and attack them. The far better strategy would be to ask him to clarify his beliefs like the two other commenters (which he later did) and then address whatever problems you may still have with his ideas.\n\nIt's not about assuming the worst in another person's comments. It's about a more general mindset of being close-minded. Open-mindedness isn't about willing to learn new ideas. It's about looking at different perspectives in good faith, and the willingness to change your views if the evidence is overwhelmingly against you. There is no open-minded about some ideas, and close-minded about others. You either are or you aren't. There is little room for in between. This applies to all beliefs, no matter how evil and reprehensible they seem to you. And yes, it is in human nature to be close-minded. \n\n(I apologize for my condescending tone at times in this)",

There\u2019s gonna be vocal and morally pretentious people on both sides no matter where you go.
