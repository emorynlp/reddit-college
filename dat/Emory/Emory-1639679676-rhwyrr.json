      "text": "Yeah contact them to ensure they wanted to post whatever as a final grade and have them walk you through everything.  If some of these were STEM classes and they had high averages.  Cut-offs may have been moved versus normal cutoffs (like it is notable that many chemistry and biology professors don't publish cutoffs at all and won't really discuss tentative grade ranges and brackets as a course progresses.  Biology has been known to pull this trick every now and then to normalize between sections).  As for other courses outside of STEM, who knows.  Usually you get what you get (no scaling grades upwards or funny downcurve stuff). B-school can get very weird as changes in raw scores across a semester can shift their little target distributions.",

If you really think your grade on opus is wrong, email your prof ASAP. This does NOT mean you can beg for a higher grade, but if you really believe your professor made a mistake.",
