  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a sophomore chemistry major at a small liberal arts school in Georgia, Berry College. Emory has always been my dream school, and this year is my last shot to apply. I have never tried because my SAT was not up to par. I have a 3.85 GPA (which will hopefully increase this semester), and participate in many ECs such as tutoring, biochem research, and I have even started my own music club on campus. Im not asking for \u201cchances\u201d per se, but I am just wondering if there is even a point to try. Thanks!",

              "text": "Any reason for the obsession with a T25? Are you aiming for an ultra prestige driven field or something?  If not, be careful and be sure to apply to places strong in your areas of interest academically whether they are in or outside of the T25 because other than Duke, among the places you copied and pasted (including Emory) the others may not provide much of a generic prestige bump.  \n\nApply and then enroll (if admitted) to the non-Duke places if they are a social fit AND are strong enough academically in your area to provide a value added effect just due to the type of training they provide and don't assume that just any old T25 is strong academically at the UG level for what you wanna learn (there can be big variations in the strength and style of undergrad programs even between T25 tier schools.  Usually the grad. programs have more in common than undergrad. Two similar ranked say..bio or chem departments can be VERY different at the UG level in terms of curriculum and calibre) Many can be vastly over-rated with respect to that and like I said, only a few provide enough of a prestige bump worthwhile enough for you to attend and get sort of mediocre academics in whatever. Also if you want an academic change vs. a prestige boost, you may wanna look at some LACs that accept transfers.\n\nThe main commonality between T25s (or whatever 'elites') is the high selectivity, wealth, and high graduation and retention rates.  They can be very different socially and academically so don't be so flippant with this aspiration.  You're no longer a prospective freshmen so do some research and find a legit fit vs. Your values and what you think you wanna study.",

This list is a bit outdated but should work: https://transferweb.com/stats/transfer-acceptance-rates/#.YQG7XCVq0lQ.\n\nYou should have solid reasons for wanting to transfer in your essays if you want a good chance. Honestly if you\u2019re premed/want to go to grad school I\u2019d maybe reconsider transferring too if you\u2019re happy at your school. Generally where you go to undergrad doesn\u2019t have a big impact, and if you\u2019re excelling where you\u2019re at rn and have a bunch of research + ECs might be worth staying.",
