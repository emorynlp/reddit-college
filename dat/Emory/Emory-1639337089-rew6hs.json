I have a few friends from oxford and they've told me how hard it was to transition into main campus because no club/ will accept them as juniors, students have already found friend groups, you can't network with Atlanta-based alumni as easily because of the distance, etc. Maybe it's ok for liberal arts, but if you're trying to do business definitely come to main. \n\nOxford people are lovely, but it kinda feels like a completely different school.",

      "text": "Look view Oxford like it's an LAC in a more isolated area (as a lot of them are).  They have some clubs and stuff but the primary emphasis is for you to get and them to provide a much richer than average academic experience at an earlier point in your career as well as more hands on mentoring. And you can get a rich experience as a freshman and sophomore at ECAS, you just have to be very deliberate in your academic choices because much of ECAS ain't just running to provide that to you (and your peers are different and may even bandwagon you away from pursuing richer experiences in favor of pursuing those that uh...\"ease the transition\").\n\nEither way, if you don't envision yourself attending other small LACs and maybe look at college as very much for networking and immediately jumping into a bunch of clubs and opportunities (especially those clubs that are designed for professional development) as well as a social experience that differs from HS, the research U, in this case ECAS, should be what you aim for. I also agree that you avoid any transition pitfalls that starting from Oxford could cause.",

              "text": "It is exactly what the others alluded to.  Unless you find time to travel to Atlanta and make connections or friends with various club members or forge connections between an Oxford version and the ATL version, you'll have to navigate that.  If you are in a popular academic area, you will also likely have to suddenly navigate well supported, but ultimately larger and probably more impersonal courses whereas ECAS folks, if they play their cards right will likely be taking smaller courses by their junior year (it is significantly more likely that Oxford continuees will still be finishing a few large core classes especially if something like pre-health given the relative lack of electives and true acceleration options in areas like chemistry and biology.  If you are pre-business, then no doubt you'll see an increase in class sizes/change in course delivery style and grading criteria that ECAS folks are already used to).\n\nI personally think Oxford could very well be worth it IF your primary goals are intellectual growth and access to mentoring, but LACs are, in general, dying for a reason.  Most students aren't choosing colleges based on that today.  They want immediate tangibles/evidence that they'll get return on investment due to the price points of these places, and you can do that if you know what you want from Ox, dive into the academic and leadership oppurtunities, etc, but if you are just someone who just wants to sort of be in college (a selective college in particular), do some prof. dev, and soak up the social scene,  it may not be for you.  Note that I am not dellusional in grandiose ideals in all high achieving students wanting to go to selective colleges to \"learn\" or for some magical \"transformative experience\".  I want people to go that route if they have the oppurtunity because I think it'll make for better alumni outcomes than the already excellent outcomes Emory has, but those serious about that sort of thing go to an LAC, a solid public school honors college or maybe sort of cluster at a couple of the ultra elites (talking like top 5 or so privates) that are still producing a relatively high % of those who go on to pursue PhDs and become future faculty members.\n\nConsider Ox if you are that student who is more serious about \"learning\" or getting real training for your career (depending on what area though. Ox may not offer enough classes in some areas) and the intellectual and leadership development aspect OR if you think starting in a smaller environment serves other needs.  But if you just wanna be a regular college student and get a \"prestigious\" degree at the end, probably just shoot for ECAS and its peer research universities.  It seems that certain \"types\" truly enjoy being at LACs and places like Oxford.  You should be honest about whether you are that type of person.",

Oxford doesn\u2019t have as much courses  as I would like, which makes sense cus it\u2019s a smaller school but I found it hard as a pre nursing major trying to find classes that I was interested in. For example im taking two filler classes that im not interested in but need just to fulfill the 16 credit requirement to graduate from oxford. Oxford is a boring ass town and the fact that theres nothing to do on campus makes it even worst, so if you do come to oxford make sure to have a car. Im sure transitioning to atl will be hard but I think it\u2019s nice to start with a close knit community first, it\u2019s easier to make friends on a smaller campus and even when you do go to the atl and you see that everyone has already formed their clique you can rely on another oxford students bc they\u2019ve gone through the same experience",

It does not in any capacity affect your chances at either school if you apply to both. I say apply to both and then if you have to decide later, decide then and don't let it distract you now. I really cannot stress this enough, Applying to only one, or both doesn't do anything to your chances.",

      "text": "As someone who was at Ox, I can prob give u a better perspective than most here. I think a good way of looking at it is for every 1 thing Ox does better, Emory ATL has 4 things that are better. I've actually really enjoyed my time at Ox and the majority of students do. It's so much easier to meet people than at ATL. Classes are the same in quality, just a bit smaller (I've heard stem students say they like Ox more but I can't speak to that). With that said, Emory ATL has much better food, location, clubs and nightlife. They also have way more classes. I think the quality of the campus is much nicer, and feels more like a traditional college. I graduated early from Ox, and highly recommend doing so because 1.5 years is the longest you can be at Ox before getting sick of it.\n\nWith that said, I and most people would probably pick ATL over Ox. However, that doesn't mean Ox sucks (which most ppl here who've never even been on ox campus believe to be true). We're still college kids and like to have fun. I really enjoyed my time over there, but I think u can have an equally good time at ATL w/o having to go through many of the pains at Ox (pretty much the location and size)",
