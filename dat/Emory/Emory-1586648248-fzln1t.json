      "text": "I\u2019m not sure about the pre-nursing requirements, but I know freshman year they like your you to take 15-17 hours worth of courses. During orientation you will meet your advisor and they\u2019ll walk you through what you should be taking. Generally freshman first semester you\u2019ll be taking general graduation requirements. That would take a ton of explaining but you can find them if you google. Look up Emory Course Atlas if you want to start looking at classes for fun, but make sure to apply the Oxford filter.",

      "text": "It\u2019s a little confusing. The short answer is that you need to talk to an academic advisor at Oxford who can help you plan your schedule and degree path and help make sure you get a good hookup with the nursing school. \n\nAdvisors are there to help you navigate the institution, so seek their help and let yours get to know you. They are totally sympathetic with the first-generation college student thing and will fill you in on any unspoken stuff of which you may be unaware. \n\n\n\nThese websites should help you get started\n\nhttp://college.emory.edu/dual-degree/nursing/advising.html\n\nIt looks like you need to focus on completing your general ed requirements and get yourself hooked up with an advisor in the Pre-Health Advising office. This can wait until you get on campus in Fall. \n\n\u201cStudents who intend to apply to the Dual Degree Program in Nursing are advised to contact the Pre-Health Advising Office in Emory College to discuss meeting the prerequisites for the program. Students are encouraged to take this step as early as possible. Students can use School of Nursing Interest Form to signal their intent.\n\nAdvisors in Pre-Health Advising will help students plan a course of study that fulfills the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing prerequisites, and all the requirements for the BA/BS degree to be awarded by Emory College.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore info re \u201cEmory Nursing Freshman Option\u201d \n\nhttp://nursing.emory.edu/admission-and-aid/bsn-programs/emory-oxford.html\n\n\nFour classes per semester + labs and maybe a fun 1-credit is a full load. People do overload, but you won\u2019t need to do that if you plan well. You don\u2019t have to drive yourself crazy in order to succeed. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Congratulations on becoming (if true, making an assumption) the first in your family to attend college!\n\nSo Emory's Nursing school is the nell hodgson woodruff school of nursing where you would earn your Bachelors of Science in Nursing. You would complete your first two years at Oxford and then apply to Nell Hodgson (I believe).\n\nThe Nursing School's pre-req classes are listed on their website (which you would take at Oxford) , do make sure you are familiar with them.\n\nThe average course load an Emory student takes is around 15 credits worth of classes, which leaves them time to do a few extracurriculars (such as clubs) while still leaving some free time to go socialize. Now do bear in mind that not every credit is created equal. (3 credits of organic chemistry is far more work than 3 credits of dance)  You'll definitely want to keep in mind the intensity of the course and make sure you have enough study time.\n\nEmory also has academic advisors available to you so be sure to utilize them!\n\nWelcome to Emory and welcome to college.",
