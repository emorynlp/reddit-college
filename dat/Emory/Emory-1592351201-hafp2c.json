  "text": "Hi\n\nI'm a prospective transfer student who was initially very excited to attend Emory, but upon learning about the new guidelines that are going to be implemented, I was hoping to see what everyone's thoughts on the matter were and how hard it would be for a transfer such as myself to even be able to make friends without clubs and organizations. I'm now likely planning to go to G Tech where a lot of my friends are, just so I have an easier launching point for meeting new people because of this whole situation. I feel as if it's honestly going to be really hard as a transfer to even be able to branch out without a lot of the stuff on campus being available.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but classes and studying with other people was the main avenue in which I made friends. Especially depending on your classes, it\u2019s really easy to make friends that way and considering that it\u2019ll be a unique time, and less going on, and classes moving faster people will be studying extra hard or possibly lounging around more. You may have to take initiative in asking people but people are generally friendly. Not sure if Covid will change how people interact however (I.e. people being less open to studying together)",

      "text": "Are you a STEM (or maybe even business) major and what courses/professors are you planning on taking? Many courses may effectively have learning teams and group work components or be environments very conducive to group study so it may be likely that at worst, you hold some type of Zoom Study sessions or whatever (which may be more efficient as it may encourage students to go in with a plan/agenda or work already done vs. a free for all where you just show up).  \n\nI am not sure how things will work, but at Emory, academics are often the way to build social groups, especially in STEM. I'm sure people will find some way of replicating this dynamic, even if watered down.",
