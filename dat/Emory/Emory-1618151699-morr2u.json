      "text": "Going to USC for anything film-related seems like a no brainer to me. One of if not the best in the nation. It\u2019s highly competitive, well-funded, and the alumni network is unmatched. You\u2019re literally next to hollywood lol. Much as I like Emory, it feels like the arts don\u2019t get the funding or suppory they need.",
