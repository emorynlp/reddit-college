      "text": "As an alumni interviewer, getting selected for an interview is by chance. It's if you show up within a certainty vicinity of the interviewer on their portal, and then the interviewer has to select you. I tend to only select students that have a similar interest in what I did at Emory, so I can speak to their major or interests better.\n\nThe best tips I have are:\n\nBe authentic. Having canned answers is really obvious. Be thoughtful about your answers, and try to go to that \"deeper\" level of conversation, the root of your values and interests.\n\nBe curious. This is may be your one time to talk to someone who has been through Emory all 4 years. Do you have any specific questions about student life? What about any fun courses?\n\nDo your research. You should know about Emory in some way to show you have genuine interest. Your questions you have about Emory for the interviewer should be more than surface level. It shows you care and want to be at Emory!\n\nTalk about your interests! I always tell my interviewees that if you have something that is tangentially related, but it is interesting or something that excites you, let's talk about that. This is how the admissions committee can know more about you that a paper application can't do. This conversation is for you, so don't be afraid to direct it some.\n\nBe relaxed! It's just a conversation and not a real job interview or anything. I approach the conversations I have as a get to know your neighbor type of way. Because if you go to Emory, we will be alums together and be apart of the same network, neighbors.",

My alumni interviewer was really honest and funny, and he spilled the real reason they have the interviews - to keep the alumni involved and inspired with the incoming class to keep those donations coming. Just remember they volunteered to be there and they genuinely want to get to know you!",
