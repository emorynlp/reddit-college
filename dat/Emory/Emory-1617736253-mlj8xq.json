      "text": "Due to covid, you unfortunately can't do a typical campus tour, but walk around main campus and check out Emory village and lullwater reserve to get a feel for the day to day. You'd need a reservation, but you might enjoy the Carlos art museum on campus. \n\nIn the greater atlanta area, I'd recommend you check out downtown decatur, midtown atlanta, and little five points. These are trendy neighborhoods and frequent locations for Emory students to get a meal out with friends. Grab some brunch at the flying biscuit in midtown or candler park. Depending on your interests, Buford Highway is known for its diversity with many great immigrant-owned restaurants. Sweet Auburn is a historic african-american neighborhood (home of the Ebenezer baptist church) near downtown Atlanta  - grab a bite to eat at the krog street market while your there. You might like Ponce City market if you want a more trendy and more pricey bite. Stroll the beltline to get some fresh air and a sense of the urban revitalization happening in Atlanta. \n\nObviously you can also do touristy things like ATL museums (coca-cola world, aquarium, botanical gardens, highart museum, ect.) but these aren't really representative of what living in Atlanta is like and if you choose to attend Emory, you'll have 4 years to hit the attractions with friends",
