          "text": "I think this is kind of on point.  Now Georgia IS in an awful position in terms of the number of cases and hospitalizations but I suspect that a serious shut-down is tied to whether there are huge changes in what is going on in Georgia and metro Atlanta and how disruptive that is for faculty and staff.  Like if k-12 goes remote and child care venues start to disappear/shut down, that is disruptive enough to the lives of faculty and staff to support a full shut-down as I have this feeling that simply having cases (especially if mostly assymptomatic) on Emory's campus is not going to be sufficient to induce a full-blown shut-down (or even a significant one of any kind).  There are too many (read: monied, among other things) incentives to keep this going as long as they can and sort of just get people used to this new normal.\n\nI am more likely to predict something more significant happening if many start to get a variant that almost completely evades the vaccine AND causes severe symptoms even among \"healthy\" young/middle-aged individuals.  I mean I can't be too sure I'm right but you even see states like New York and cities like NYC with politicians desperate to avoid remote learning in k-12 and are going forward with in person even with shoddy preparation it seems.  There are just a ridiculous amount of forces driving institutions to open up and stay that way unless conditions are extreme.",

              "text": "Shocking (sarcasm).  I hope people in things like STEM or quantitative social sciences (hell, there is evidence that even humanities professors were kind of holding back a lot during remote learning:[https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/09/01/helping-students-meet-rigorous-standards-covid-world-opinion](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/09/01/helping-students-meet-rigorous-standards-covid-world-opinion) ) understand that these in-person courses are likely to be significantly more demanding (in terms of the amount of effort and independence need to succeed) than the online versions last year and especially the spring they sent people home, and barring the instructor getting Covid and going online, any type of isolation or quarantine resulting from them deciding they wanna risk going to large parties can really sting them even with accommodations (which should be there but not abused).  It's really easy to fall behind in in person classes, especially those where group work and group problem solving are sort of essential because professors give problems hard to just tackle alone the first go round.\n\nThese people are taking risks with their health and grades at the same time (sans Covid rates this high and need for isolation and quarantine, partying wouldn't be a big deal, but with it, a student is likely not gonna be 100% engaged/immersed even with access to lecture videos and stuff unless all study groups meet through Zoom now which I doubt. And forget it if they have symptoms.  It's like being taken off the board).  I almost wouldn't worry about them screwing others over and getting the university shut down, but they are risking more than they and their accompanying friends' health.",
