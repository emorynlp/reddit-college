  "text": "I\u2019m a freshman and I\u2019m curious about how much time you spend hanging out with friends and going out in a week and what you guys do for fun. I\u2019m ngl I sometimes feel like I\u2019m not enjoying enough or I feel really guilty for enjoying too much. Ik there are too many variables but I\u2019m curious what\u2019s the case for you guys and what\u2019s your major. By socializing I mean going out or just hanging out in dorms or on campus. Like studying in the library does not count",

      "text": "Kind of a little confused about what you're asking but I'd say I spend around 30-35 hours a week socializing but that's because I've made it a personal goal of mine to be really social this semester. I'm a psychology major and I'm premed. So far it's mainly been eating, studying, walking around campus while talking (or even just talking at a random place), playing games, and going to on-campus events together.\n\nI've been wanting to do more - thinking about going to the city and maybe hanging out with/meeting new people from other universities in ATL. Also attending more club stuff, general events, speeches, and outdoor retreats. I'm taking a light course-load this semester which is the only reason how this is possible and I think I have valid reasons for wanting to spend so much time with people. I'm definitely keeping academics/ECs above everything else but I also want to make sure I have a good time in college and not slave away studying 24/7 for my classes. I don't think you even need to really. Might be a controversial opinion but I think you can have a good work/life balance while being premed if you manage your time well.\n\nI will be pushing myself more academically in terms of my course schedule next year though for sure. Kind of have to tbh.",

          "text": "I don't think that is an opinion. It may be a fact for most. Generally(like maybe unless you are NBB, chem or something like CS, physics, QTM) the hardest/lowest grading pre-med courses are the cores which are relatively spread out by most.  You may get more of a run for the money academically if you are a STEM major (at Emory mainly non-biology STEM majors), but it isn't like pre-med is engineering where students are essentially forced to consistently take schedules crowded with either lower grading courses or high workload/project based classes. Often at worst, pre-meds have 2 STEMs and some GERs or something supposedly less intensive for the last 2-3 courses. And then a lot of life sciences courses tend be largely exam based which should leave lots of time to explore and socialize if you manage it well and spread out studying (depending on how deep exams wanna test you).",

              "text": "I\u2019m not too well versed in everything but from my anecdotal observations I see that engineering people tend to socialize a little more than the pre-meds. At least when I look at friends at engineering schools. They\u2019re not out partying all the time but they do socialize. Ig it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have as much GPA pressure or probably because a high IQ can help you skate through engineering stuff a bit faster than say pre-med stuff which is more extensive",

                  "text": "At a place like Tech, they socialize in a more academic context for sure because their courses are more project based and social. It is even possible that this bleeds into bonds outside of coursework, but I'm just saying that pre-meds SHOULD have more time to socialize given how their STEM courses are spread out.  But no, premed stuff is NOT more extensive. You can take pretty watered down pre-med core courses and still do well on the MCAT if you already test extremely well or pay for a prep course.  And you certainly don't have to go deep into ANY discipline to be admitted to med. School. If you find a path that makes it less work to maintain a gpa, do all the right ECs, and do well on the MCAT. You're golden and usually maintaining an optimal GPA does not = taking professors and classes that make you learn and think at a high level (though if you can maintain it in those types of courses, it will likely mean the MCAT prep comes easier) It = taking stuff where obedience is sufficient to score well on exams and assignments.  \n\nWhat \"can\" happen is that pre-meds need more volunteer, shadowing, and formal prof. Dev. That takes time away, but no the academics are vastly different. Engineering is much rougher and more interdisciplinary which is something most pre-healths (still largely biology majors) wouldn't be able to handle [imagine making bio majors and the average premed do more math oriented or biophysics related courses or a math intensive biochemistry course?  Most Emory premeds don't even take a calc. Based physics course...I'm just saying) don't do as well on average.  \n\nAlso some evidence shows that engineering majors are highly self selected such that engineering course averages at most places are slightly higher in mean grade given. But when you have to pile those and harder versions of basic science and math courses (including more advanced math than calc. 2) into a schedule, something is much more likely to go wrong in at least one of them.",

It makes me more productive to have a lot of stuff going on so having time to socialize really helps me in school!",
