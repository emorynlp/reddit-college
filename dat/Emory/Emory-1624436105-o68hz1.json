  "title:": "Alumni, how did your diploma arrive?",
  "text": "Referring to those that got their diplomas mailed to them, I\u2019m interested in what type of packaging it arrived in. I know it doesn\u2019t come with the Emory blue cover (they offer picking the covers up at the school, but no way am I traveling that far for a folder). Is it simply the diploma in a flat cardboard envelope that can be easily bent? Or does Emory take measures to prevent folding/bending? My mailbox is tiny. Thanks in advance!",
