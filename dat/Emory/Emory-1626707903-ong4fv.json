There's also a closet, though you share it with your roommate.\n\nYou'll need linens, hangers, a laundry basket, all the usual clothes stuff. If you're in a suite, youll be cleaning the bathroom so get stuff for that. But you definitely don't need to buy any kind of furniture unless you want a beanbag chair or something.",
