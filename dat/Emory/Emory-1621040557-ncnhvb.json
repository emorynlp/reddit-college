  "text": "I\u2019m planning on taking genetics and wanted Spell but she isn\u2019t teaching it this semester. My major advisor said Rieder\u2019s good but I can\u2019t find anything on rmp (just 1 review which was pretty positive). Do you recommend I take her class or should I just take it when Spell teaches it?",

Her exams can be challenging and are very different than anything from lower level biology courses (very application based). However, she is so dedicated to her students and despite her being relatively new is still one of the best profs I have had at Emory!!! 10/10 would recommend",

      "text": "Before banking on Spell who I highly recommend, contact and ask if or when she'll teach it again. Also, maybe try Reider out. Seems she is among a new batch of junior research faculty in bio who actually care about teaching and developing undergrads(Seems Civitello, Vega, and maybe Morran are among them). Just get the syllabus and try her out for a couple of classes. Can't hurt. Plus looks like 264 has some quality control (though looks like Hickmann would be a last choice,264's style and emphasis on problem solving and research apps is the same and testing styles seem similar).",

According to what I heard from my advisor, genetics is supposed to be 1 semester Spell and 1 semester Rieder but because of the shift to online learning Spell took over this year so Rieder wouldn\u2019t have to develop a new class for an online setting. Because of this Rieder will most probably teach Genetics the whole year.",
