      "text": "The class is honestly too new and you'd have to look for a pre-COVID exam(2018 or 2019 I think) to see how challenging they are.   I did see Heemstra's last exam and it was more challenging than average for him because the mechanisms were harder and he made you draw orbitals or explain aspects of some of the harder mechanisms.  I would expect the final to be like that but longer just based on what I saw from the COVID final he gave. The test was of course easier than pre-COVID but the mechanism problems at the end of the test were either tough or tricky and the test was generally tougher than midterms.  On an in person final I would expect such problems to take up a greater share of the exam and expect the standard items(T/F, product prediction, synthesis) to have \"tricks\"(include nuances like resonance, aromatics, and rearrangements) that test for understanding more than simple pattern recognition.  So if you succeeded on his last exam, repeat what you did. \n\n If you struggled or were more average, practice writing out mechanisms AND explaining the key steps you take: like write out the interacting orbitals, an electrostatic explanation, etc. Be able to justify each step.  This will even help you on product prediction items with \"land mines\" because you should be able to draw out the first step of a mechanism and think: \"oh wow, I can do a rearrangement that results in a more stable carbocation, so instead of just stopping at this 5 membered ring with a 2ndary carbocation, I'll gone ahead and expand it to the 6 membered with a tertiary carbocation\" or \"I can get a 2ndary with resonance if I do a hydride shift\".   You really just need practice but not in a repetitive way where you mindlessly rewrite arrows for problems you've been given in LA sessions and OYOs.  You can redo those, but explain each step and maybe even ask why something else didn't happen or make up a slightly different scenario that might change the outcome.\n\nIn addition, to avoid complacency and to develop a nimbleness that allows you to better deal with curveballs, you might just look for intermediate and harder problems outside of Heemstra.  Could be a Weinschenk, problems from another institution, whatever.  My overall point is that it looks like Heemstra typically writes a \"killer final\" which is a final that more heavily weights more analytical/thought provoking items than the past midterms (so yes, it can even end up tougher than E2) so you don't want to go in expecting the exact same problem types or super similar as on practice. Derivation may be involved.  It's possible that he won't this year, but it is better to be safe than sorry and you should prepare in a way that would have gotten you like 80+ on E2 if you didn't score that.",
