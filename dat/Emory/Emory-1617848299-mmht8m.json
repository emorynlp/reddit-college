      "text": "Emory does not have an official screenwriting major, however, most people I know with screenwriting ambitions (such as myself) are on the playwriting track. Most playwrights find work in film/TV and vice versa, so the skills you learn in your playwriting classes will translate pretty smoothly to the screen. If that still doesn't work for you, you're always able to double in film and creative writing or build your own major.",
