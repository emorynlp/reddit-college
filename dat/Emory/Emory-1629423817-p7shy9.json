  "text": "Hello,\n\nAnybody here that has taken cs170 without any prior experience? I have spoken to many students on-campus, and the majority seemed to already be near fluent in some coding language. For someone with no CS background, is this class enjoyable? can you catch up? how is the workload? I am aware the class is difficult - but does it feel like an introductory class?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthanks in advance",

      "text": "I don't know about CS 170 from any experience, but before people answer, be careful when you ask the loaded and vague question of \"does it feel like an introductory course?\" because you will get different answers depending upon the students' intended major/track and purpose for taking the class. Some will view anything with a high level of intensity (beyond sort of just knowing barebones basics-or quite frankly, anything that will result in many people getting Bs and even a chunk getting some type of C grade) as \"too much for an intro. course\" (forgetting that this is Emory and that many professors expect students to do more even at the foundation level than a much less well selected student body) when it really may reflect future courses or just be the tip of the ice berg in terms of what some of the more rigorous requirements in a major demand.  \n\nGenerally, \"introductory\" STEM courses in any department are fairly intense with the average professor especially if they serve as a gateway and foundation sequence or course for potential majors within the discipline and those adjacent to it.  For example, chem 150/202 should be considered objectively intense (or even unexpectly tough if you've taken an analogous dual enrollment course at an average community college or much less selective state school prior to Emory.  That experience will be the reference point for such a person and they may expect Emory's version to just be a faster paced and rearranged version of it with the same exact content) to many if only because they cover material most only expected to see as sophomores at other schools, and even fairly well prepped students will have to work and practice a lot to succeed.  But then, even with a more moderately rigorous instructor, 203/204 use that firm background and expect you to grow by leaps and bounds to do much more complex problem types and even re-learn some of the same or similar material through a very different conceptual framework. If the 150/202 courses were too intro like in the classical sense of what people think of, students would get completely blown away by 203/204 vs. at least having a work ethic and a decent conceptual foundation  to work with). \n\nPoint is, do not set expectations of what introductory classes are supposed to be like.  That solely depends on the goals and context of the department/major they serve as a gateway to.  What I will say is that most STEM intros, while intense enough for sure, are designed to be doable to the inexperienced and unless there is significant curve grading happening, having more experienced people in the course will not hurt you.  As long as you are trying and working hard, I am pretty sure you should even be able to lean on them for help!",
