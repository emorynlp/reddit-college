You\u2019ll be taking about 1 or 2 more classes than the usual student basically. The track is doable I know people who have done it.",

Sometimes I would feel the urge to just get through all the prereqs and do med to the best of my ability, but I\u2019m bad at chem and being split is really taking role on my academics, mainly bc I\u2019m constantly worrying about two different fields at the same time so studying for classes like accounting really takes away from dedicating more time to chem. Idk, I\u2019m really lost. What \u201cwrong reasons\u201d were you having and what made business seem attractive enough to add another year? Sorry if this is a lot of questions",

It\u2019s also just what your passionate about ya feel? I was so tunneled on being a doctor I never realized I had interests in business and stuff.
