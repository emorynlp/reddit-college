I don't exactly know what I'm supposed to study-- **Is it Java or JavaScript?**\n\nAlso, it would be helpful to know if it's worth taking since I'm a math major but plan on having a career in CS. Is it worth it?",

Now I\u2019m planning on sticking to getting a degree in math so CS 170 isn\u2019t a requirement for me, but everything you said makes sense so I\u2019ll stick to it.",

              "text": "If you want a career in CS, at minimum take 170,171, the data structures and algos class, and databases. From there pick and choose electives relevant to the kind of CS you want to do. Maybe consider the informatics minor if thts interesting to you.\n\nAlso since you are from Agnes Scott, I\u2019m assuming you are a woman, I highly recommend joining Rewriting the Code, a national nonprofit. It\u2019s a great group of women who help each other succeed in tech. Helped me a lot moving into CS and then DS from a nontraditional path.",
