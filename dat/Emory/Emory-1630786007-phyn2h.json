  "text": "Reddit, I hated to do this because it sets myself up to the hands of people\u2019s opinions, but I\u2019m literally losing sleep by not knowing. So thanks for reading this to help me out.\n\n\u2014\nI\u2019m a senior in a pretty competitive highschool, Emory knows my school well because of its rigor.\nI have a cumulative 3.37GPA, because my 9th grade GPA was 2.7. I took a few honors and 3 APs including this year - aiming for a 4.0 on my last year. I worked on my academics after facing a momentous lifechanging situation after 9th grade. At 9th grade, I created an online biz and made 38k in revenue, 4k in profit\n\nI have served in various nonprofits, performed in school musical, play on varsity team, yet never really got a leadership position. In short, I tried everything and got involved, yet not super involved because I am realizing I have some problems trusting people my age. (It\u2019s hard for me to make friends, and it bothered me a lot before, but I learned how to love myself as who I am now) \nWhy do I still get involved? I get involved because I love learning, and I truly want to make the world spin faster as one of my mentor puts it.\n\nFor my test scores, it\u2019s sitting at a 1250-1300.\nI am aiming for a 1500 SAT, next one in October.\n\nHow does this sound to you? Do you know anyone who was in the same situation in Highschool too?\n\nThanks and much love \ud83d\ude4f",

Do what the other commenter said and then do the best you can with the stats, tell a good story and show solid thinking in your personal statement and supplements and submit the damned application and see what happens.   There is no reason to panic.  Do the best you can. You'll get into some places and not into others and then you'll enroll somewhere and turn out well I'm betting.\n\nHell assuming that most students at these types of schools are somewhat humble and have a head not in the clouds, admits might not even fully understand why they were admitted over others who looked similar or better on paper or on actual substance and if their head isn't full of air, they should get that a lot of luck and things completely out of their control is involved. There is hardly certainty in this process even for candidates with the highest stats and there is nothing anyone can do about this stuff but get the best app they can in when the application volume is so high.",

      "text": "I\u2019m ngl to you. Just based on pure admit stats and anecdotal evidence of people I\u2019ve talked to, your stats are unfortunately on the lower end by quite a bit. However there are some people who I\u2019ve met who definitely were fairly different from the average and activities they did helped them get in. If you\u2019re at one of those Ivy feeder schools you might have a chance but 3.37 is definitely pretty low especially without a high test score. What could work in your favor is your turnaround but even with that you have managed but even with that you\u2019ve probably managed like a 3.7. It\u2019s definitely not bad but even that is barely like the 25th  percentile. I can\u2019t say what your chances are but just what I know. Honestly a 1500 won\u2019t really make you stand out at all. In fact I believe for the class of 2025 the average SAT was above 1500 something like 1510-1520 is the average admit. I\u2019ve met way too many people with 1550+. So if you really want to stand out you\u2019ll probably need like 1570-1580 tbh if you\u2019re using your SAT to cover your GPA",

Not sure how much that changes your outlook, but I had a somewhat similar situation, where my GPA grew sharply over my four years in high school. I wish you the best of luck, though, and congrats on the online business!\n\nJust curious, what kind of online business were you running? 34k in costs seems kinda rough.",

This whole process is meaningless and no one in the real world cares where you got your degree from outside caring somewhat for employment purposes. \n\nYou\u2019ll be fine. You sound like a driven kid. Apply to places now but don\u2019t think your life is over if this doesn\u2019t go well. Do well in college, consider transferring if you want to (freshman year college grades matter more in transferring but also do well on the SAT) or just do really well where you go. The experiences you become involved with in uni matter more than where you go. Like I said before, this period of your life really doesn\u2019t a ton even though it might be hard for you to see it that way now.",
