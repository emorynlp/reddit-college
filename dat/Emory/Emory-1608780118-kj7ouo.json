      "text": "I don't know about a \"conversation\" (Don't see why you won't just tell us what you are looking for/expect from here).  I just know that if you prefer more of a party/sports and Greek driven atmosphere like those in college movies usually centering public schools but with smart partyiers who made high SATs, then Emory isn't the place for you because it lacks D1 sports and D3 football and Greeklife isn't as dominant as at other southern schools (including some peers).  It is a \"work harder, play or play hard\" type of school where a sizeable chunk(as in more than typical at self-labelled \"work hard play hard\" schools) of students actually embrace the academics beyond just getting grades. \n\n In addition to that it is gonna skew towards a cerebral or more academic feel (though there is still plenty to do) simply because students cluster in more rigorous majors (vs. having a huge chunk in very fluffy ones) and a drive to encourage students to engaged academics more deeply (Like getting Latin honors outside of the business school requires you to do research, take a grad course, and complete a thesis whereas many peer institutions only do it based on GPA percentiles).   \n\n*You should put Emory in conference with other D3 schools like Tufts, JHU, Chicago, WUSTL, CMU and many LACs quite frankly.  It feels more like those places than many other research U privates outside of the Ivies (and really hardly none of those have a particular party like atmosphere) than say a Duke, USC, Vanderbilt, Tulane, Miami, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Dartmouth, or maybe Cornell to some extent even though it has a similar size as many of these.  Expect a more quirky student body and traditions on a campus in the forested parts of Atlanta thus leaving quite a bit to do; Just don't expect non-selective \"public school lite\" campus social vibes and pride (and definitely don't expect public school like academic attitudes from most students..maybe a solid minority but definitely not most). Really not what Emory ever was and definitely not what the administration there is going for.",
