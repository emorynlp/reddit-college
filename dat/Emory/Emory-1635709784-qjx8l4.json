I mean are you taking challenging courses or professors this semester and doing extremely well?  If not, and you feel like you are just cruising right now, you may be in for quite the adjustment next semester and may want to consider dropping 1 of these.",

The only class you may find challenging is Math 210 but it honestly shouldn't be that bad. You would still probably have less work than a pre-med/cs/engineering major to put it into perspective so you should be fine",

          "text": "math 210 is supposedly HARDER than most of the courses pre-meds take (outside of organic chemistry with a more rigorous than average professor and a couple of NBB courses, most pre-meds take courses in biology which can have fairly good grade distributions in the end.  In addition, biology majors can often dodge the more intensive biology electives and cores in favor of courses that aren't intellectually demanding and only require memorization and regurgitation.  How do I know?  I was a bio and chem major) and is graded on a very standard B- type of curve. Apparently it is quite demanding and QTM 110 is usually far tougher (even though it is known to be worthwhile and enlightening) than people expect.\n\nThe question about the b-school courses comes as an issue of accessibility and readiness.   I'm guessing that unless they are a GBS scholar, they probably can't access 1 or both of those courses.  In addition to that, they would be competing against predominantly juniors that are probably not taking other intellectually demanding or lower graded courses like math 210, QTM 110, and possibly QTM 150 in some stretches.  Furthermore I think those two b-school classes count as cores and not electives so they aren't graded on the softer distribution and it won't matter how objectively easy they are (what matters is if you have enough time to dedicate to them to consistently beat enough people on assignments, quizzes, exams, whatever to stay in the A range, assuming the OP is squeamish about avoiding non-A grades)\n\nThe OP could very well be at a disadvantage versus more seasoned students who ultimately have easier courseloads.  I usually support students challenging themselves to an extent, but I haven't seen a response from OP saying whether or not they are being challenged at all THIS semester and if they are handling it well.  And if they are shifting from an objectively easy schedule to this schedule, it could be VERY rough.  If they have a similar intensity schedule now and did fine, they may be able to just polish some things and transition more easily.\n\nEdit: Quick research deduces that the OP likely isn't in a particularly challenging schedule this semester (they may be in calc. 1 which can be challenging assuming they didn't come in with an AP credit, but QTM 150 and QTM 110 apparently got punted to this schedule they are proposing now and everything else is like econ 101 and other stuff like a frosh seminar, PACE, and health).",
