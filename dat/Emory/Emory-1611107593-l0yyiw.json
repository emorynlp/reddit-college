Decatur is closest but kind of small, the dunwoody Y has more space and is less crowded. And there\u2019s East lake which is smaller than Decatur. \n\nLa fitness: you have n. Decatur one, toco hills, midtown, Brookhaven and more. I\u2019ve heard good things about la fitness but there customer service at the n. Decatur one (by Walmart) has been low quality in my experience.",
