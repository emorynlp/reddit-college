  "text": "Hi guys! I am a rising sophomore and hope to glean some info on the Emory sororities. I have some friends in sororities and have gone to a few of their parties and understand Greek life but I was just looking for more information. \n\nI am looking for an EPC sorority and hope to eventually go into investment banking so I was wondering which sorority would have the best network for that? (I was going to join AKPsi but I already am in enough business school club type extracurriculars) If anyone would be able to DM me the reputations of each of the sororities I can't find that information anywhere that would be amazing.\n\nFor example \"BBB is shallow and none of them are actually friends with each other, AAA is the traditional pop culture sorority you see in movies, XXX has a lot of English and philosophy majors and are more laid back, YYY goes to the Hamptons every summer and focuses on parties don't rush if you don't have money, ZZZ is extremely academically and philanthropically oriented but are still chill on weekends\"\n\nI'm not really worried about hazing and stuff I'm good with that and don't really care about \"rankings\". Thank you so much!",
