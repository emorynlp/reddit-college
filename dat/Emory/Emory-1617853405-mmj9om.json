  "text": "My mom has recently shed considerable doubt as to whether or not she truly wants me to attend Oxford which was previously my top choice. She seems to have gotten the notion that Oxford offers inferior academics with an under-qualified staff and fewer resources such as libraries. She also has suggested that Oxford students are largely unadjusted socially and transition poorly to the main campus. We are visiting in about a week to check it all out for ourselves but in the meantime I would appreciate if anyone who might know could shed some light on the topic for me. Just to offer some context, I am considering between Oxford, Tulane, and Colorado College and am on the waitlist for Atlanta campus. All input would be deeply appreciated, thanks!",

      "text": "Hey OP. I wrote this for another person having that perception so check it out!\n\nA lot of people have the misconception of Oxford being \"inferior\" to Emory, but it is totally wrong. Even if you look at the class profile on their website, there is negligible difference in the statistics(ie. the 75th percentile of SAT and ACT are 1550 and 35 respectfully for both campuses; gpa differs by 0.03), and I think the AOs take fit into account extremely carefully if you happened to apply to both campuses. I have a few friends who are in the Oxford campus and they love being involved in close-knit communities, close relationship with professors(some even invite you to dinner which is p sick ngl, and you get that thicc rec letter for medschool), and a great education overall because of the smaller classrooms(98% of classes have a class size of 30 or less) meaning increased quality of care. Oxford is just Emory at a smaller campus and I have seen people getting rejected from Ox but in at main, so it's not really up to ur academic merit, but more of fit as I said earlier. I am sure you will find a good place at Oxford if you attend because Emory is just a stellar school and you're diploma will have Emory on it, so if you're worried about that, there is no need. And no one judges you for going to Oxford because there are literally 1000 kids coming into main after sophomore year. Although I may have some pride/bias because I am attending Emory, I strongly recommend Emory.",

              "text": "Dude, view Oxford as an intensive 2 year LAC experience. It is that simple and the Dean there came from a 4 year LAC and the gen. ed requirements reflect the things you commonly see at selective LACs.  I don't know what your mom is talking about.  It just doesn't add up.  It wouldn't really even add up when Oxford WAS a bit less selective than main.  Even then, it had a more selected student body than UCLA and people generally have not considered that a B school.  You can believe whatever from your mom, but prepare to sweat and be rewarded academically perhaps more than you would on main.  The social life stuff will be different because again, it has the hallmarks of more stereotypical LACs(in ruralish area/isolated and small).  Depending on what you're studying, Ox can be super beneficial.",

Oxford classes are nice because do to their small size you get more individual attention from teachers. There are more libraries on Atlanta campus but there's shuttles that travel back and forth between campuses so if you want to visit an Atlanta campus library you can.",

Who wants to give thought provoking assignments or test items when there a say..200 to grade?), you are very lucky or know how to choose professors because Ox has a lot more quality control no doubt (the two do NOT have to be the same difficulty.  That used to be the case when Ox was a bit less selective so was concerned about bringing students to a certain level before continuing to an ECAS major.Ox is pretty much doing its own thing now and has been doing so for a while in many STEM areas).  ECAS has an awful lot of researchers who don't have time to challenge undergrads in a meaningful way. So congrats to you on finding a way to keep ECAS high quality even with these freshmen COVID courses (which seems to have affected the quality of main way more than I imagine it did Oxford).  You have to be quite deliberate given all the choices.",

There's probably difficulty differences between teachers within even just Oxford or just Atlanta campus, but so far the classes I've taken at both I didn't notice any difference between difficulty level or quality of teaching. Maybe I will in the future, just has not been my experience yet. I have been told by people who took Bio 141 lab at Oxford campus (one of the ones I took at Atlanta campus) that there's was a lot harder though, since now I'm taking 142 and 142L at Oxford. Yet on the flip side I took chem 150 lab at Oxford and from chem 150 lecture (another one I took at atlanta) their lab portion sounded harder. Perhaps not all but certian courses do have to have the same difficulty I would think. Like for example for the nursing school it would be pretty bad to have Oxford prereqs be much easier and have those students come in totally unprepared proportionately to Atlanta campus students.",

I'm sure many just think a class is a class, but professors can make night and day differences especially on main. Like in some STEM courses there, a professor could be the difference from taking the equivalent course at an HYPS tier vs. taking it at like a not even medium selectivity public university.  And this happens in other divisions as well for multi-section courses.\n\nAnd yes, Oxford is known to have variation, but what I notice is that usually they probably cluster together and an easier person for a multi-section course tends to be an outlier.  ECAS has a bunch of weird stuff going on/way more autonomy given to faculty it seems. BTW, Oxford is great at lower division biology and physics education (ECAS seems better at chem I think)",

All the Oxfordian kids loved the experience and thought it gave them a leg up. It's still Emory, yo, don't let the titles fool you!",

      "text": "I'm Atlanta campus but from what I heard the biggest obstacle for Oxford students is not being able to build long-term relationships with faculty because they get torn out of campus halfway through and plopped into a whole new pool of professors that have never met them. \n\nThe social adjustment problems are real, but mostly because Oxford kids come to main campus with a pre-made friend group and there's not a lot of incentive to talk to new people.",

          "text": "I get the feeling this is division dependent.  From what I have seen with my own eyes(as in you will see Ox faculty on campus), most of their STEM profs tend to keep close ties with them because there is often collaboration between the faculty (especially in chem where they are still making adjustments to the curric.).  But at the same time, many students who don't make faculty connections in early years on main (sadly way too many as people usually don't think about that early on and large classes can be an impediment as it allows many students to disengage or hide and then earn a grade which does not = enough to catch the attention of a prof), won't have much connections either and will be developing real connections in later years.  \n\nI could see what they said as a potential difference but I don't wanna under-estimate how few people on main make these permanent connections early on.",
