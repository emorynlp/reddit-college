I had Brandon Wicks for sometime and his class was incredibly dull and boring, so I then switched to Dr. Laura Heath-Stout for 101. She was absolutely wonderful!! Her class wasn't that much work, she was super understanding, and more importantly her readings were genuinely interesting!",

      "text": "Huh?! Choose stuff you like and/or are classics.  The English classes usually come with different themes of the professors' interest.  Whether or not the class is \"easy\" will depend more on what the professor demands (though there are apparently some come minimum goals between classes: [http://writingprogram.emory.edu/first-year-writing/index.html](http://writingprogram.emory.edu/first-year-writing/index.html)) than whether it is 101 or 181.  See when they put in a fuller course description, and choose which one you like, visit the course to check them out and get the syllabus, stay if you like it, leave if you don't. Assuming most of these instructors are fair graders, you'll probably do better if you find the theme they choose remotely interesting. I took 181 and it was just comp. lit. The person I had was cool, I learned, and it wasn't like they were a particularly harsh grader from what I can tell.  I seriously doubt if they were, it was because it was 181 though.",
