          "text": "Hi there, thank you! My grandmother is in really ill condition right now and she lives out of the country, so my parents have been sending a ton of money to her. My mom also lost her job last year and has been holding temporary positions, but the recent corona virus has made it virtually impossible for her to get a job. We included the fact that she lost her job in our tax information when we originally applied, but I don't really know if we talked about sending my grandmother the money and of course, the corona stuff is new. I think those things helped me get the money because my tuition per year was originally half of my entire family's salary. So to sum it up, the corona virus helped us a lot (ironically)! Even though there isn't any major circumstance, I think it's still worth a shot - we didn't know if we'd get anything because we'd put my mom's job loss on our tax stuff already when I originally applied! But you should definitely still try! The answer is always no unless you ask. Good luck! :)",

          "text": "Hi there! Thank you! My parents wrote the appeal - I read on Forbes that the parents should write it - so I don't have a physical copy of it, though they had me read it and check it over. Basically, my parents have been sending a lot of money to my ill grandmother who lives overseas. My mom also lost her job last year and has held temporary positions, but the corona virus has made acquiring a job virtually impossible. We had already included my mom losing her job in our documentation when we originally applied, but the original aid I got was still half of my entire family's yearly salary. I think the corona virus part helped us get more aid. When you're writing your appeal letter, definitely look online to find tips! We ultimately decided against putting an actual $ amount for how much we needed (my parents decided that), and there were a lot of tax forms we had to fill out. I would say keep it plain and simple - one page is enough - but still stress that you really want to go to Emory, but finances are the only catalyst. Best of luck! If you have any other questions, PM me!",
