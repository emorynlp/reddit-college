  "text": "Hello, I am an incoming freshman at Emory, so I'm new to this process. When I transfer AP Credits to Emory, does my hs grade for the class also follow into my college transcript? Or do I just get the credits and move on? I'm asking because I may not submit some of my AP Credits if the grade transfers even if I got a decent enough AP test score for the test.",
