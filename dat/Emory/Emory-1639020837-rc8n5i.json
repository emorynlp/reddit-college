  "text": "So my gpa is trash, but I\u2019ve taken all honors classes and 7 aps throughout high school. I\u2019ve founded clubs, have a lot of leadership roles (outside of school clubs and roles), and am interested in pre med. my stats are 3.6 unweighted and 4.0 weighted, 34 act superscore (33 in one sitting), immigrant(idk if this influences anything at all lol), and I am a national merit semifinalist. \n\nI want to end up at a good university, but because I\u2019m interested in medicine, my main choice would be a bsmd program that is direct to medical school. However I doubt I will get into one, and so I am considering ED2 to Emory. Are the chances for ED2 higher? Will I be against a more competitive pool of applicants? Should I just stick to EA and let myself explore my options? I\u2019m rlly conflicted",
