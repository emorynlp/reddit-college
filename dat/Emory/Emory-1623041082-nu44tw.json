It\u2019s one of those b school classes where almost everyone has a failing grade numerically and the curve balances out the letter grades.\n\nI found it much easier and much more interesting than financial accounting.",

              "text": "They\u2019re practically unrelated, they\u2019re so different. Managerial builds on the VERY basic (like, class number one shit) language of financial, but other than that it\u2019s almost a completely different process.\n\nFinancial accounting is what an external accountant would do, auditing, etc. Managerial accounting is more learning about the continuous accounting process an internal manager of a firm would do. I found it much easier.",
