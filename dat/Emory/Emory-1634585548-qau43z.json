      "text": "Weinschenk. Always try taking someone that will also teach a related course if possible.  All sections will end up with a similar grade distribution even if exam difficulty varies.  202 is the foundation for 203 which is challenging and Weinschenk teaches. Taking W may provide an advantage because he'll probably tailor to what folks need to know no matter who they have for 203. The other 2 are grad students who will probably not teach again at Emory and certainly won't teach 203.",

That being said, they're grad students, so expect it to be a somewhat different experience.\n\nPost in particular was doing some course development work a few years ago, iirc, so she may have good ideas for how to run her section.",
