I\u2019ve heard to submit if you meet the 25th percentile but not to otherwise. I don\u2019t think when you submit matters. I submitted my app on the day of the deadline lol.",

Honestly, you can do whatever you want. And this isn\u2019t just true at Emory \u2014 it probably is for like 90% of universities in the US.",

              "text": "This really depends on the country of origin. International students are much more likely to stick to people from their home country if A) English is clearly their second language and B) there are a lot of other students from their country. \n\nI\u2019m not international so take this with a grain of salt, but from the outside looking in it seems like most internationals with homogenous friend groups segregate by choice. If you want a diverse friend group you shouldn\u2019t have a problem finding one.",

              "text": "I\u2019m a domestic student but hang out with a bunch of international students. From my experience, it depends on how good your English is. Most international students I know are Chinese and they mostly only hang out with other Chinese students. If their English isn\u2019t great, it\u2019s hard to become close friends due to the language barrier. In my eyes, I see no difference in international students and wouldn\u2019t treat them differently from domestic students. If you speak English natively, no one will tell you\u2019re international.",

      "text": "I lean towards a no, but make sure the other pieces of evidence of academic achievement are strong in your application.  Like it might be nice to show subject level strengths through high scores on AP, IB, A-level, whatever your school may have.  Showing you can take rigorous tests in key subjects (especially if related to areas you express interest in studying) may be able to help you for sure in addition to general indicators that you took rigorous course schedules in the context of your school.",
