  "text": "My daughter is waitlisted at Emory but we want to consider her options should she get off the waitlist. She wants a more liberal arts approach to environmental work (what most schools call their \"environmental studies\" major). At Emory that is not an option but it appears there is a lot of flexibility even with ES. Can anyone comment on Emory for someone who wants to go down the path of environmentalism from the sustainability, activism, justice side... Also she is currently deciding between Tulane, Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara among the schools where she has a current admission. Thanks!!",

      "text": "I'm an ENVS alum! I had a lot of fun while I was there ('14-'18). I think sustainability is the strongest area other than geology and ecology. The department was starting to investigate environmental justice a little more seriously when I left. I'd recommend looking into Drs. Yandle and Hall for more on that (environmental policy and watershed/streams, respectively).\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nETA: there is the option of the bachelor or arts or sciences. BS involves taking calc, bio, and chem but neither one is better than the other, imo. Taking chem is REALLY tough at Emory, though, since it's mostly for pre-med students and so is used to weed out people aren't serious about medicine. You can definitely take a more liberal arts approach with tailoring the classes to your interests/needs.",

      "text": "Hmm, I hope there is an ENVS to answer but to me it always looked like Envs at Emory is overlooked (as it is almost everywhere) but has a boat load of resources(including sizeable fellowships for those pursuing research:[http://envs.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/scholarships-awards-grants/index.html](http://envs.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/scholarships-awards-grants/index.html))  for undergrad. education (seems robust with a couple of 4+1 programs, a capstone requirement, and several cool minors) and undergrad endeavors.  Maybe you should take a look at course offerings(look at like the past 3 semesters or so.  Some semesters will offer pretty detailed descriptions) at all these schools to see if there are things that support her interests. I know Emory's has a huge emphasis on sustainability: [https://atlas.emory.edu/](https://atlas.emory.edu/) and so does Emory generally so there will be lots of opps in those areas. Your daughter may also want to look into this faculty member: [https://www.wabe.org/after-lead-pollution-findings-in-atlanta-a-free-program-to-test-georgia-yards-for-contamination/](https://www.wabe.org/after-lead-pollution-findings-in-atlanta-a-free-program-to-test-georgia-yards-for-contamination/)\n\nYou may want to check out the admitted student virtual events because she may actually be presenting.  But either way, your daughter will have some cool opps given her interests and Emory also tries to make the public health connection with ENVS and that is pretty much a way to make a social justice connection as well (especially in Atlanta).  While I tend to be cynic about how schools market, I think some of the student stories and marketing videos ENVS are reflective of the level of support and opps in this department that is typically slept on.  Seems that there is so much money and faculty support for different things swimming around in a department with relatively small enrollment versus other sciences (the same cannot be said for say...physics at Emory).",

          "text": "I don't see any reason to automatically do that unless it is far cheaper. The program looks good but in a fairly stereotypical way that isn't oriented towards social justice or whatever which what the OP claims their child wants.  I would be willing to dismiss Emory quickly if it didn't serve them well, but I can't do that because the program is strong, well resourced, and oriented towards it now-a-days. Just because they said \"activism\" and Berkeley is stereotyped as a place where that is common does not mean that the department there would easily facilitate or promote it within the context of environmental science.  Also being in a town/metro like Atlanta with serious income and wealth inequality along with environmental issues to boot as it grows doesn't hurt them at all.  UCB if Emory is expensive, but Emory would be a really good option if they are comparable in price for whatever reason.  Tulane's is housed in an engineering department and is extremely biased towards earth sciences and general climatology so I don't think that fits as well.  Seems UCB, Emory, and UCSB have the range to engage a range of interests in the area which surprises me (so good job Emory ENVS)",
