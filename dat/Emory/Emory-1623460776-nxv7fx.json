  "title:": "Have you had an internship? Here's $5 to tell me how it was. (Canary)",
  "text": "Hey all- I'm a student over at Georgia Tech! Over the past 2 years some friends and I have built a site called\u00a0[Canary](https://canarystudent.com/register), to read (and write) anonymous reviews on internships (and the interview process).\n\nWe've gotten hundreds of reviews from GT students and now we're making a big push to get Emory student's experiences on the site. For the next 200 Emory students: **If you** [leave a review](https://canarystudent.com/submit)**, I'll email you a $5 amazon gift card.** Simple as that. It takes about 4-5 mins to fill one out and will help students after you navigate getting an internship and their career. Once you submit it, as long as everything checks out, I'll sent it to you as soon as I see it!\n\nLastly, we're still actively working on the site, so don't hesitate to reach out via DM with suggestions or leave a comment on what you think of the platform, or if you just wanna chat!\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the support! From now on, ***please DM me on here so I know you came from reddit.***",
