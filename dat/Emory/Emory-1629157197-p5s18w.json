      "text": "The primary dining hall on campus, the DCT, has a lot of healthy options. At breakfast, there is almost always various fresh fruit, yogurt, eggs, potatoes, and a variety of other special items they have that day. For lunch, there is a vegan station that is pretty healthy. It is easy to find a meal balanced with carbs (rice is common), veggies, and protein (meat and tofu). Additionally, there is a salad bar and there are various soups. I would say it's easy to find a healthy meal on campus, if you can avoid the unhealthy temptations there like pizza and sweets!",
