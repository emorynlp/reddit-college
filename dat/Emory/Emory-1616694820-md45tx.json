  "text": "Hey Emory community, \n\nI was recently accepted to Oxford college at Emory university and I have a couple questions for pre med students.\n\n1. How are the pre-med courses? What is the grading system? Is it easy to get an a?\n\n2. Is it easy to find research and work opportunities at labs and hospitals?\n\n3. How is the study abroad program at Oxford? \n\n4. Is it easy to get leadership positions, volunteer opportunities, and specific courses?\n\n5. Do you have any recommendations on how I should organize my schedule if I want to major in biology, minor or major in Spanish, and do pre med?\n\n6. How well do the courses prepare you for the MCAT?\n\nThanks for your help!",

      "text": "1. The pre-med courses at Oxford are good as they prepare you very well for future courses in their respective fields. As some others have mentioned the grading system varies with the professor. One thing of note is that some of the chemistry courses at Emory have a unique grading system that relies on high passes, low passes, and no passes which can be difficult to adjust to. Finally, they are not easy As. Depending on who you are and how you study you may have an easier time that others, it is very subjective. \n2. There are lots of opportunities to get involved in research or labs. Oxford especially is really easy to get close to professor and develop a relationship that can lead to a position in a lab. Furthermore, if you stay alert for emails that include opportunities or ask individuals who have previously or currently worked in a lab they can direct you in the right direction for getting research experience.\n3. I am a double major pre-med student and I have been able to study abroad twice during my four years at Emory with the first time being a summer program at Oxford. Being able to study abroad is definitely something you can accomplish, and if you are focused on taking pre-med classes there are opportunities like the University of St. Andrews which can provide excellent chemistry and biology education. \n4. Oxford is very heavy in club life. Due to the campus' location and its relatively isolated nature clubs are very common and impactful and almost all of them have some sort of service side. Furthermore, through things like volunteer Oxford or volunteer Emory there will be plenty of opportunities for leadership and service. \n5. I would say take a schedule that you can deal with and will not cause you to sacrifice too much of your social, mental, and emotional health. A lot of students definitely have to play a little catch up after they transition to Emory College but that shouldn't scare you as by that time you will be more in the grove of college and know how to deal with greater amounts of stress. One thing I did that I think helped a lot was that I took physics at Oxford instead of waiting until junior year. For the major or minoring in Spanish, I would say speak to an adviser or see the course load that comes with the second major. \n6. The courses definitely helped me prepare for the MCAT as they really solidified the foundational topics the MCAT covered. There was very little in the test that was new for me. However, depending on your course order you will have to review differently and relearn material that you took your first year.",

      "text": "Before anyone else answers, you should know that 1 and 6 shouldn't go together (unless you go to a school with a far less selected student body where there may even be a curve in what would be considered 'easier' instructors for an Emory/Oxford. But even 'easier' STEM instructors may not be an automatic A/A- at Ox/Emory because you need to perfect with a more competitive student body). If a STEM class is easy to make an A in, unless there is some insane curve that gives everyone an A (which doesn't exist at even at the most grade inflated private colleges for pre-med core STEM courses), chances are it probably isn't going to prepare you much for the MCAT. \n\nSomething that is easy to get an A in at selective schools likely only demands that students be able to do lots of memorization/regurgitation of content/problem types and lower level knowledge/problem solving which is what most high achievers have mastered, but just isn't what the MCAT is about.  Plan to seriously work and think hard (critical thinking, applications, going beyond the textbook. At Ox, an intro biology class LECTURE, and not just lab, may even have you read primary literature at some points) for your grades (I think Ox is fairly consistent so the answer to 6) would be yes.  At ECAS, it depends on which STEM instructors you choose because there is lots more sections and variation across professors).  \n\nAnd note that grading schemes will vary by professor.  There is probably no general pattern other than the general average grade target.  Some professors may give more \"straight-forward\" high-stakes assessments/exams so may use a standard scale.  Others may give more challenging high stakes assessments and therefore lower their cut-offs to recenter (kind of like a curve but not a bell-curve, more like a skewed one) the course average to something reasonable. At Ox/Emory, expect average course GPAs to be in the B-, B-/B, or B range for pre-med core courses in a \"normal year\".  This means that assessments may have high 70 to low-mid 80 averages already so 93=A, 90=A-, 87 B+, etc, or maybe the assessments average 70-75 or lower in which case those cutoffs are lowered to whatever the professor desires that will ultimately get it in the range I mentioned.",
