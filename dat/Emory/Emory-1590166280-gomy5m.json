  "text": "For an incoming freshman interested in biology, how early on can one take up research opportunities and actually start working in labs? Is it really hard to get the chance to work in labs or are there any prerequisites? And how exactly do you figure out what lab is into what type of research?",

      "text": "Email PI's you are interested in working with and ask if they have any opportunities.  Don't expect your own project, or even to be contributing to research efforts right away.  Be willing to do things like wash dishes and make growth media, and know that as people learn you are reliable/capable they will give you more responsibility.  That was what I did to get started, and it worked like a charm.  I eventually worked in several labs during my undergrad (I am an alumni), and got to skip the whole \"can they be trusted\" step once I had a track record of being dependable and producing results.  My freshman year was spent in front of a plate pourer metering out nutrient broth for free, my senior year was spent doing meaningful research with a stipend from the NSF.",

      "text": "From my anecdotal experience, getting into research particularly as a freshman is REALLY easy in comparison to other schools. While it may very from PI to PI, a lot of them are accustomed to having some sort of undergraduates in the lab, and freshman are really great because they have a long time to learn and become familiar with the field of study. \n\nHandshake (the job recruiting website for most universities in the US) has tons of job offers for lab assistants, and I got interviews for things I was not even remotely qualified for (i.e. doing animal surgeries while my resume basically only showed programming experience lmao. The interview was a little awkward ngl). \n\nIf you're looking for research, just contact the PI or a postdoc (PI is usually a better choice) in the lab who is doing research in the area you are interested in. Don't get hung up on the actual details of the project, because in reality, there's no way you'll know enough about anything to actually understand what you may or may not want to work on. Do not expect the pay to be great, or for any pay at all in some cases. Labs generally tend to like paying kids if they have federal work study from the people I've met, but after a while, I'm sure you could get paid.\n\nP.S. Don't be so inundated with getting research in a particular field. It's almost like another class, use it as a chance to explore. I'm a CS major learning about neuroscience, so glad I did!",

      "text": "This depends on the PI and stuff.  You may want to go on the undergraduate research website and look into the matching program (Research Partners I think) and prepare yourself to do that process once school starts up.  Naturally some PIs will want some key intros or intermediate STEM courses done or else it'll be more difficult to understand what you are doing.",
