  "text": "Hey!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoping someone can answer my questions, Emory has been a dream school of mine for a while and I hope to gather as much information as possible. Most questions are about being Pre-Med at Emory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Do you feel the advisors supported you in the best way possible?\n2. Does Emory offer sufficient enough MCAT prep? Or did you seek outside tutoring (from companies such as Princeton Review, etc.)\n3. Do you feel your research opportunities are limited due to Emory's location?\n4. How easy is it to cold-email professors and get research?\n5. Is the pre-med culture competitive or collaborative?\n\nI'd appreciate if anyone who is comfortable sharing their experience informs me, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much!!",

      "text": "Everyone's opinion here is fine except for that MCAT question IMO.   I think Emory can EASILY prep for the MCAT but course and professor selection is so important in determining that at Emory and really anywhere, but ESPECIALLY at Emory.  A lot of the schools with significantly higher placement rates (like approaching 80% or higher) have more regulated pre-med course sequences where maybe only 1-2 sections or professors are available which means people go through roughly the same calibre training.\n\nEmory will have like 5 or more in some cases which means that the level of training you get can become very uneven across professors and sections since they are not heavily regulated in terms of how they teach and assess material and honestly part of the MCAT is learning how to take a very different style of assessment that involves an awful lot of reading, extrapolation, and understanding of data and experimental design even in areas like STEM/biological sciences where that type of assessment style is not common in US k-12 in those areas.\n\n  If you decide that you really only wanna protect your GPA, you naturally won't choose many courses and professors that build those skills because the STEM sections on it are often not as content based as the AAMC provided materials would suggest and are more about thinking.  \n\nI've observed that students who took several of the right professors that assessed the skills I alluded and SUCCEEDED (I would say B+ or higher in most) could honestly put less intensive prep into the MCAT because these professors designed their courses in ways that made you deeply understand material in a way beyond regurgitation or sort of low level problem solving.  Others who dodge them and then don't wanna compensate by taking analogous upper divisions that reinforce or build upon that material and assess it in a more MCAT relevant way will often struggle or have to pay more money to prep for the MCAT unless they are already some God test-taker that is even ready for the MCAT which is quite rare even at an Emory.  It just depends on how you go through Emory's STEM curriculum.\n\n  If you are already gonna come in and worry that you aren't cut out to do well in certain professors' courses that would be most helpful, I don't recommend Emory because you are gonna pay a lot and not get as much out of Emory as you should.  It may be better to go to a less selective school with similar calibre courses and a weaker student body so that you have more room for error (you can just ride the curve if a course is tough in a good way) or even just pay less to go to a school with a weaker student body and weaker/less intensive courses.  You may be near the top if you try hard enough AND you buy extra time to just prep for the MCAT early and put more effort into ECs, and prof. development since you may just breeze through the curriculum.\n\n So if you are the type already(or eventually) going to different subreddits asking:\"Will I automatically get a high GPA here if I just try? Because I need one for med. School\", Emory isn't for you because it has pathways that allow you to cheat yourself out of a strong preparation and no one is gonna convince you not to take those paths. And then even the \"easier\" courses that are more in line with how you may have learned and succeeded in HS just aren't easy enough(as in they are still often tougher and more time consuming/immersive than analogous courses at much less selective schools) especially considering how prepared the other students are for the same type of courses. \n\nThis means you have to be perfect and score a raw 93, 94 or whatever that professor sets the A at.  There is very little room for error because the average in those types is likely to be in the 80s which means no curve (Emory is not as generous with grading as many of its peers.  If the average is B- or higher in a STEM course, they assign grades as they are and a B- is a 2.7,okay but not very useful for med. School admissions).",

Also coming from a competitive HS is great and it probably IS good prep, but you have to be honest about if you want to continue to learn and be assessed at high levels (perhaps even higher than your type of HS if you are taking top flight instructors).  A lot of HS students, especially those coming from such schools are straight up burnt out and may be hoping to cruise off of prestige and mostly avoid engaging the types (and I do mean type-not all rigor is created the same.  Some STEM teachers can inundate you in content and ask you to do lots of regurgitation of details and tedious but predictable problems like many more rigorous k-12 schools do or they may push you to think about and apply material in very different ways than how you explicitly learned them, or a mix) of rigors a highly selective university/college can offer.  You just never know. And note that there are ways to balance your schedule (academical and social) even if you choose to engage the type of rigor I talk about, but there are many so over HS that they kind of do wanna just cruise even if it is to their detriment long term or puts that at risk for a lackluster MCAT performance.",

      "text": "Senior here - applying to medschool next cycle. \n\n1) Premed advisors can be hit or miss - you will find that they do not give you much attention / information until you\u2019re actually in the process of applying. When you\u2019re actually applying though, they will be in frequent communication with you. A plus at Emory is that our pre Heath committee writes you a \u201ccommittee letter,\u201d which means that (for most MED schools) you only need to ask for four letters of recommendation plus the committee letter. This being said, at Emory you have like 4 different advisors (minor advisor, major advisor, pre health advisor, and research advisor). So if pre health advisor isn\u2019t working, chances are you will find support elsewhere.\n\n2) classes here prepare you well for the MCAT, as long as you pay attention and understand the material. This is because some professors will build course curriculum with the explicit purpose of preparing you for the MCAT, since they know most students are pre med. Of course this depends on what professors you get per course.\n\n3-4. The exact opposite - Emory has so many opportunities for research it\u2019s insane. Keep in mind Emory is a major research institution, and basically every professor has some type of research going on. Cold calling emails, going to office hours and building rapport, and you\u2019ll find something. I\u2019ll often get department wide emails with the header \u201cX professor is looking for research assistant\u201d. Emory is also in close collaboration with Georgia Tech, and you can find joint research opportunities between the two institutions - especially for biomedical engineering related fields. \n\n5. I don\u2019t care what others say, this culture is not as competitive as other schools. This is for one primary reason - most classes are NOT graded on a \u201ctrue\u201d curve, so no one is trying to compete with others. In some schools, only \u201c10%\u201d of the class might get an A, and so this creates a competitive environment. At Emory, (at least for pre med classes... business school is different) professors will never \u201cdecrease\u201d anyone\u2019s grade to fit a curve. If anything, professors will give EVERYONE extra credit to fit the test mean. I feel like students at Emory take this for granted... you generally won\u2019t see this at a school like Georgia Tech. This is apparently a hot take, but Emory really helps students achieve relatively high GPAs in the premed field. The class average is a B for most classes, not a C (which is the typical average in most schools). \n\nAll this being said, pre-MED culture anywhere is going to be toxic. There are a handful of students that seem to self-loathe and talk about how much they hate doing pre-MED work... and are weirdly proud for adopting unhealthy habits like \u201cworking so hard and pulling all nighters\u201d. You don\u2019t have to be part of this crowd. Do things that both look good on a resume AND that you actually enjoy. That\u2019s my best advice. Never do anything just to put it on a resume, and you\u2019ll have a great experience, and spend time with people that actually like their life lol.",

          "text": "Georgia Tech does the same grading in the life sciences and really in general.  They scream and jump up and down about how hard everything is but their data doesn't lie and they have a lot of it.  The main problems are in like physics and math where some professors still may have averages lower than B-.  You have to keep in mind that most students at Tech are engineering majors so have extremely heavy course loads versus a pre-med or any life sciences major (except the extremely ambitious ones) at any school (including Tech) meaning that you're more likely to be below average every now and again because it is hard to manage a schedule with 4-5 STEM courses with several being project intensive (vs. just exams).\n\nBut even then, their grades are now quite high.  And other peer schools also curve up when they have to.  The question is where does the curve sit.  Most of our peers do like a B+ for gateway STEMS.  At Emory, I think maybe only bio is B/B+ and everything else is targeting B- as a raw or curved mean which is more like lower (mostly less selective) grading privates and elite public schools.  Doesn't mean Emory is competitive, but it does mean that the grading is not as inflated as some similar schools.  Of course you are right that \"most\" schools aren't selective so some do still do the C average, but often those courses are a bit simpler in their demands.  At selective universities (say with SAT mean/median 1300 and up), the B range is a typical mean with publics heavily leaning in the Emory direction (B- or C+/B-) and lesser so a big chunk of our private peers (B+ and in extreme cases A-! Of course I'm talking non-COVID and in person years here).\n\nI think Emory is mainly less competitive, not because of grading, but because departments like NBB, Biology, and chemistry do a great job of promoting active learning and team-based/group learning vs. just doing straight lectures and exams (which is common at a LOT of schools, including peers in life science arenas. It's hard to pull that stuff off with large class sizes and section sizes tend to be bigger at our peer unis) and telling everyone to just run off and fend for themselves.  They give extra assignments or incentives to work together which creates a healthier environment (beyond the toxic personalities) than what you may expect at a pre-med heavy school.  Still toxic, but more bearable in terms of the academic and intellectual environment I guess.",

And if you aren't taking classes with your best friends, not many people will want to help you, I've felt that it has been pretty competitive instead of collaborative. I'm now a bio and finance double major and the business school students are a lot more collaborative than I have experienced in the regular college. The B school advisors are also infinitely better than the college advisors.",

      "text": "1. I don't go to premed advisors. Premed advisors come in three varieties: never applied to medical school, not a current medical student, maybe went through the app process/physician but no longer in touch with current med school applications. None of these varieties can help me gather further information that what I can obtain on my own, and sometimes their outdated information can be misinformation.\n\n2. There is no course curriculum in college that's designed to prep you for the MCAT. Intro courses and medical school prerequisites give you enough background in the topic to get by and you have to learn more on the side to feel prepared. Upper-level courses go into too much detail than what you need to learn.\n\n3. No, Emory has a ton of labs and opportunities for basic science and humanities research.\n\n4. Difficult. It's best to take a class with the professor then ask, apply to the SIRE program, or do FWS in a research capacity.\n\n5. I wouldn't know, I don't declare my intent to go to medical school to people in person. Each premed carves their own path, and talking about it now is just a dick-measuring contest. Asking advice from premeds is also the blind leading the blind, although there are some established advice/facts/stats out there that won't hurt to pass around.",
