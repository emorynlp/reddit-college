              "text": "Yeah, assuming you want to take a good chunk of more serious (let us say it is only like a 1/3 for MCAT or pre-grad prep and then you just wanna do memory oriented classes for the other 2/3 to preserve a GPA or something) intermediate and upper division biologies, those two will mentor and teach at a slightly higher level than the others which is important given how many cores and electives have pivoted away from just raw lecture and memorization of details and towards research and experimental biology.  I think I counted and like 2/3 of classes now have a primary lit. discussion section or mention in course descriptions how they emphasize discussing the papers during lecture (as in a textbook is not the key source of content, so the more your gen. biol emphasizes things like critical thinking and context/cases in assessments (assignments, test, in class activities, whatever), the better you'll adjust to those types of classes.\n\nI think this really matters for classes like biol 264 where if you get a lower rigor 142 section, you'll be at a disadvantage versus all the Oxford kids who are taking it because Oxford's 142 curriculum has not changed and thus still has an insane amount of overlap with 264 AND they already do things like read a couple of papers as part of the 142 lecture component so they come in with a lot of experience with \"thinking in biology\" vs. just MCQ tests that emphasize details and maybe standard genetics problems.  Just position yourself as well as you can now and sort of crowd out some RMP noise.\n\nLike Spell has taught 14x for a long time and has been hammered for being challenging in the past (wasn't really her fault, 141/2 was just tough back then and the old AP bio test was very memorization oriented in its design so people would come in with an AP 4/5 and be caught off guard by the fact the course stressed applications not only in the slides but on tests.  They expected it to be easy after killing AP) and her and 14x are a shadow of what they used to be, so she'll tend to have lower ratings even though she is a legit pedagogical expert and REALLY cares about students especially if they show a serious desire to learn and she is known to even take 142 students on things like field trips to the CDC on certain occassions. On the other hand, Cafferty is a decent lecturer for sure, but is gonna water down assessments and will use simpler teaching methods because he'd rather focus on his upper division students.  Abreu seems too hit or miss )especially in 142- I think he is historically better for 141 which is more in line with his PhD research) and I have been hearing awful things about Reyes and you'd need to ask friends if he seems to have improved.  And lastly, if you had AP for 141, you will more easily handle like a Spell even if she decides to challenge students simply due to the new bio curric. being more standard than in the past.",
