              "text": "While ECAS administrators claimed that 2/3 of the courses are in person, I think 3/4 or more look like they'll be online.  If it is online, then the seat allocation doesn't have to be limited to some arbitrary (likely tied to the size of the venue) number.  They can have more seats than normal.  In addition, many will be deferring or taking a gap year/semester, which should leave some seats even if they don't offer additional seats.  ECAS depts can find another way to hit certain headcounts that are typical for a normal school year, and letting Ox students in is one method to do so and makes a lot of sense to me.",
