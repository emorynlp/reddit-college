Are you even taking it for MCAT prep or are you just taking as a de facto med. school requirement/strong recommendation (and thus need to just slap it on your transcript)? If the latter, just take the darned summer course.  If you need to learn biochemistry in any meaningful way, probably find a course and take it during the regular year.  I mean, I really wouldn't recommend anything but special topics courses with Escobar, but if you are gonna have him, at least do it in person/semester with all the support resources (LAs, etc).",

      "text": "I don't know about summer but I took Biol 301 with Abreu and many friends who had Kelly and Escobar. Escobar is by far the hardest out of the three. Almost entirely flipped classroom. If you can wait till the fall and take with Kelly or Abreu it will probably be a better experience. Heck even fall with Escobar where you can have EPASS tutoring and LAs available sounds better",

          "text": "But was Escobar \"hard\" in a good way, or was his teaching just off and that made it hard?  I think it matters IF the OP is trying to prep for the MCAT(vs. slap it on the transcript) because I hear that Abreu is almost too simple (and writes tests that are such) and I know from experience that Kelly can be \"hard\"/medium but it is like a petty memorization/know all the details from the slide and book type of hard vs. \"make you think and problem solve sometimes\" type of hard (he had these stupid \"increase/decrease\" questions towards the latter half of the class where it was better to randomly guess if you didn't know vs. formulate a logic and get the whole section wrong. Only every now and then would he have a question that I would consider \"good\" in terms of how the MCAT tests biochem).  From what I heard, at least Escobar tried to write more passage based test questions and slightly more authentic problems.\n\nI just don't know if his teaching is up to par and I took him for 141 and he struggled to explain chemical concepts effectively.  Sometimes the \"better\" experiences that are easier just aren't as fruitful for certain purposes.  Like I don't think Escobar even with all his problems was known to have particularly low averages for biochem and that may be because he had those additional resources that the other 2 that were more memory based probably didn't have.  Unless he has a very low average or something (to me, it would have to be 75 or lower with no curving the grades back up for it to be a concern/a truly \"hard\" course. Like if they all come out to a B/B+ average in the end and Escobar's class was more MCAT aligned then I don't know, The others may just give more immediate comfort and gratification), it may be worth getting exposure to whatever problems and testing style he gives especially since he gives things like cases, p-sets, and extra practice apparently.",

              "text": "According to my friend who took Escobar, the new Chem 204 ended up being more useful for the MCAT than Biol 301 w/ Escobar. Idk about my friends who took Kelly. I took Abreu but never had to take the MCAT. I agree that Escobar doesn't have particularly low averages, I think it's really how well can OP handle flipped classroom (which Escobar is the only one who does) on the accelerated timescale of summer classes. I think with the new chem curriculum aids with filling in the Biochem basics/gaps, so the difference between Abreu/Kelly and Escobar isn't huge in terms of total knowledge gained.",

                  "text": "I.suspect 204 is more useful than ALL bchem 1 classes and that may even include chem biochem but at least the latter can be at a better level because it has 204 as a pre-req.  People really should just take chem bchem if they want better exposure metabolic biochem OR just save bio bchem right before med. School apps (possibly after MCAT). If you are a pre-grad in life sciences like I was, I question whether any memorization metabolic bchem courses are worthwhile(unless you are going into metabolism or mitochondrial biology). \n\n Seems most of the memoization oriented classes I took at Emory were just a big waste of time outside of an occasional GPA protectant/balancer course because starting 1st year of grad. School they aggressively try to de-program students from learning that way anyways in attempt to get students thinking more like they'd need to for lab and grant writing exercises/qualifyer exams.  Pre-grad and pre-industry folks should try to get experience with this stuff at Emory to smooth the transition. A lot of my cohort members ended up putting way too much time into their grad classes (vs. Rotation research) because they never had to learn biology or chemistry in certain ways so needed to.put in extra time just for an acceptable grade.\n\nAside from that, those teaching 301 should sort of rethink how it works and should be able to take liberties considering how 204 will make huge chunks of it obsolete.",
