      "text": "I did this past spring and I heard it'll be online again for his class. He was definitely fine as a lecturer, he fell behind towards the end and didn't cover the renal system but he left that as an optional lecture that wasn't on the final so it wasn't too bad. His exams are pretty much slide-based, if you memorize his slides and do the problem sets he gives you for practice you'll do fine in the class. There's also some optional extra credit he gave where you could replace a weekly assignment grade if you do all the online Mastering A&P assignments, plus your lowest weekly assignment grade is auto dropped so you can basically lose 2/11 assignments if you do poorly on them. The only thing is that his problem sets that you can use for exam prep don't have keys, he requires you to go to the TA sessions for the answers, and your camera has to be for Zoom Attendance grades. Overall though it isn't a bad class I'd say.",
