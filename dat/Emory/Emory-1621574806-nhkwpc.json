  "text": "Hi I was accepted as a transfer student for this fall (NBB). I dropped a chem class and after contacting Emory, they said it was ok. However, now I'm failing math and I'm freaking out. My admission is definitely getting rescinded right? This semester has been a hell of a ride and I have never done so poorly. Do I drop and get a W? Do I pray to god that I somehow get a C which I dont think will happen?  \n\nIs there anything I can do about it?\n\nThanks for your time.",

I have no idea what emory will do but they probably want your money at this point. Unless the low grade is super damaging such that it is in a course that may inhibit degree progress (because NBB is a very \"busy\" major), they may not bother but for yourself, assume that you are going to Emory and want to avoid math 116.",

                      "text": "I don't really know.  You may wanna contact them and ask an NBB advisor if a standard calc. 2 course will count if you aren't double majoring in something that requires it.  They may really want the math 116 anyway. I was just throwing it out there as a consideration.  If you retake and/or pass now and they do take the course then no harm done. If the answer is no and they want 116, then you are wasting time and money.  I suspect the answer is yes because Oxford College students do NBB and Oxford does not offer a math 116 equivalent.\n\nAlso, I would also rethink the \"protect\"(you can't constantly be in defense mode. Learn as much as you can and perform the best you can but don't put yourself in a position to have to frame it that way again. If you already frame it that way, NBB might not be the major) GPA  thing going forward. Go to Emory, \ndo the best you can by performing better(avoid more Ws in STEM especially in major courses that contribute to degree progress). Of course try to keep a balanced enough schedule to ensure you can put time into courses and do your best (and do your best to LEARN at a HIGH level. Believe it or not, NBB classes and cores minus NBB 201 are not just memorize and regurgitation oriented so you and many Emory students will have to adjust if your previous life sciences courses were like that), but you will have to do better at Emory and look forward to your MCAT as well which means you'll need to be able to handle the tougher(non-regurgitation and plug and chug focused courses in the NBB major and other pre-med cores) if transferring to Emory is going to pay off.\n\n NBB is a tougher major than most anticipate I think you'll probably be fine as most courses will go back to in person and have a lot of resources associated with them, but be careful and get ready to work and think! Also please tell me you are coming in as a sophomore. \n\nBecause NBB may be a not only challenging route (in a good way) but a rough one (bad, as in will be hard to balance schedule) if you are coming in as a junior from elsewhere because of the amount of core classes and elective requirements that may pile up. Also what STEM credits would you bring(let us exclude math in case you drop)? That'll make a difference as well.  Just don't want you coming off a rough year/semester walking into punches. If you came in last year you would have at least had the Covid leniency in grading and test design but that is all likely about to disappear so you'll wanna be well positioned to adapt.",
