However I would argue that if you are planning on going into a high paying field (six figure salary), it may be worth it even if it\u2019s $50k/yr. I\u2019m thinking careers in high finance, med, law, and FAANG. In the long run and when looking at total lifetime earnings, the cost of undergrad will be small if you\u2019re making that kind of bread. If Emory is the best school you go into, recruiting for jobs may be a lot harder at lower ranked schools.",

      "text": "I mean it is hard but not impossibly so. The content of classes is the same everywhere. The classes are more rigorous than the average college though. The professors are fantastic and very well renowned often some of the best but it depends. Also college is very different from high school. So it really depends on the teaching style you like. Like I personally preferred the way math was taught in high school but some other things are taught better in college. The social life is pretty decent but it\u2019s not nearly as fun as your average flagship state school or some D1 places like Duke, Vandy and the party scene isn\u2019t as good as them. I would say even some of the Ivies have better party scenes. The campus can seem kinda dead on weekends but a lot of people go to bars. So it\u2019s really about who you know. People do hang out though quite a bit. There are definitely a bunch of pre-med, finance, increasingly CS/math hardos but it\u2019s still pretty good. You\u2019ll meet some really accomplished and amazing people. They\u2019ll have such unique backgrounds and many are very uniquely accomplished. That honestly is a huge plus for me. A lot of very wealthy people though. Emory is also very diverse probably one of the most diverse in the nation. Although it\u2019s predominantly still white and Asian+Indian. Worth it is a really broad term. Worth it compared to what? Is college worth it? It will depend on your aid and your other options. Emory is fairly generous in financial aid so just apply and see what happens. Getting into Emory and other Emory level schools is difficult so see what happens.",

          "text": "Only criticism I have is \"the content of the classes is the same everywhere\"....I used to believe that a long time ago, but it isn't true for a lot of areas, especially at Emory (not true at many super elite tier schools either) where there is a lot of curricular experimentation in some departments or where they let professors teach whatever and however even in intro. But I think you are more so in the pre-business area.  There can be big differences in STEM but even in social science/humanities areas like political science (where at Emory and some of its peers, you'll often have key intro. political science courses including U.S. politics using novels and primary source articles but at a UGA or places with less serious political science curricula, they'll just stick to a classical textbook.  It makes for a completely different learning experience and issues end up being framed very differently) and history.  Ideally, even as a pre-business person, you'd hopefully run  into some core courses or pre-reqs that are quite different even content wise from much less selective schools, but perhaps even some peers. If not the pre-reqs, maybe GERs.\n\nEither way, this disclaimer has to be here for when the naive pre-med comes and unexpectedly is learning a significant amount of organic chemistry (including reactivity) as a first year, or notices that the bio sequence is basically backwards from their friends' schools. Or the QTM major taking the weird hybrid calc. 2/3 hybrid course (math 210) with a lab that I think involves using some python to model.  There are plenty of oddities at Emory, and way more at places like Harvard and them.  Even if you don't account for how heavily tiered intro. courses are at super elite schools, they tend to do weird stuff in a lot of classes geared towards 1st years and early career UGs.",

I've heard its pretty hard but I didn't know they assumed prior python knowledge. I personally took BC in high school(didn't take the exam out of laziness but got an A in the class) so I don't know if that class will be hard. Is it a better idea for me to just do Calc 2 and Calc 3 instead of Math 210?",

                  "text": "Well that thing about the similarities at the fundamental level ain't true but for so many courses either but whatever. Like foundation level bio courses at the HYPS tier schools are more like intermediate or advanced level elective biology courses at newer elites like Emory, VU, WUSTL, and basically all \"lower Ivies\".  They aren't teaching the same thing with the same framing at all really (like Harvard life sciences 1a could give graduate level molecular cell bio and chemical bio courses at other elites a slight run for the money and it targets 1st and 2nd years at Harvard).  Some places are way ahead of the curve and are pushing students to do more than the standard level of learning on a consistent basis which is why I promote Emory's best and more different professors on here so much and likely to little avail.  People wanted to attend those schools at one point but don't actually know or want the same level of demands or training. \n\nHowever, giving yourself that is ultimately the way to compete with them beyond the superficial things such as grades (which they will have as well).  And even with things like econ., math, and CS, they are less about alleged \"content\" in the syllabus versus what problem types and projects professors demand students to do and places with strong curricula demand that students do a lot more with whatever they are explicitly taught.  That makes a huge difference regardless of what a syllabus claims about topic coverage.  Like if it says one thing but an assignment or exam basically asks you to use that to derive something more advanced on the spot, that makes it a completely different course versus one that basically demands students solve the same problem types used in class or given for practice. Generally you are more likely to find the former at elites but it is even more commonplace at the most elite schools which explains part of their advantage beyond the magic of \"prestige\" and stuff. A lot of the prestige comes from that whether those at other schools wanna admit it or not.  \n\n210:  If you are QTM you MUST do 210 because course targets data science specific scenarios.   And I'm sure they don't assume anything but solid calc. 1 knowledge.  I think the python is just a cursory exposure to it with no intense programming.  They just use it to show how it is a powerful tool to model the behavior of certain equations.  They likely want QTM majors taking 210 because 210 is more regulated than 112 and 211 where you can choose easier or awful instructors.  QTM courses are known to actually hold students accountable for whatever math and concepts taught in previous courses and likely decided that key math from calc. 2 and multi.  are most important.  They used to host a class that crammed those and linear algebra into a single semester but I guess it wasn't working well/students couldn't retain much so they came up with 210 and a whole lin. Alg course in 221 as the answer.",

      "text": "Before people blurt out answers (I will have minimal participation in this after this. Unless you have a question this will be my contribution) that are completely based on and framed around what their personal expectations of college (not even an elite, but college generally) were, you may want to expand on what YOU expect or want:\n\nFor example:\n\n1. \"Hard?:\" What does that mean?  Are you talking academic challenge?  If so, what do you want to study because that makes a huge difference in terms of how challenging your academics will be?  2nd, do you desire or even expect to be challenged (I always find it strange and slightly concerning when people ask if a top tier college is academically challenging.  That often signals that the student doesn't exactly want that aspect of top tier schools, but \"may\" tolerate it if it supposedly boosts outcomes/has some prestige).  Do you expect this, or are you looking for a change maybe if you come from a competitive or super rigorous HS?\n2. What do you want social life to be? Are you looking for rowdy, constant party atmosphere on campus, or maybe a \"lite\" version of that, or is a more laid back scene where students just access the city to have a wilder time fine with you?\n3. I don't see how people characterize this when there is so much choice (as in professors folks will never take)/descretion in professor selection and the fact is that we often aren't even choosing courses based on quality of professor or even course design.  Hint: Often 1) and this go together when picking classes though I think this is a tad bit lesser the case at Emory than some of its peers (as in you have a decent chunk that will happily take harder professors if they are good at developing students in some type of way).  Also, people have different expectations and perceptions of what a good teacher is.  What is yours? For example, is an enthusiastic, bright, feel-good lecture with minimal student interaction/engagement your style (It is many people's style whether it actually helps learning or not)?  Would you prefer engagement?  Do you mind flipped and hybrid classes if done well, or have you experienced that in HS and are completely averse no matter how well it is done?  Will instructor rigor influence how you interpret their teaching quality (basically do you expect to be spoon-fed all content or are you fine with teachers who only give you fundamentals and the assessments demand you do a lot outside of class to succeed on them because they demand higher level thinking?).  You have all these possibilities at Emory even in areas like STEM because there are often more than one professor per course or even per offering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically what are you looking for (and it may be a mixture per category)? because maybe people could cater answers versus that versus sort of saying:  \"OMG, Emory is perfect\" or \"Oh this is horrible\".  If you describe your values/what you expected, others can frame their answers versus those or their own values and expectations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I also agree with the above poster especially considering how many approach college.  And depending on what track/opps you want, it may even be risky to construct anything close to what is a \"worthwhile\" experience at the price points of OOS elite publics and privates.  I suppose it could be easy to have a fun social life if you pursue a less rigorous area or pathway of study though.",
