  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman this fall sem. I\u2019m planning to do the dual degree with Georgia Tech so I\u2019m trying to opt for GERs that satisfy both schools\u2019 requirements. I was just checking out the Transfer credit system at Tech and they offer first year writing credit for ENG 101 and ENG 181 but both of those course aren\u2019t available on atlas anymore??? I only see CPLT 101 and ENGRD 101. What just happened?",

      "text": "Looks like Emory changed the 1st year writing program and combined a lot of that stuff into \"English-College Writing Program\"(ENGRD) and the classes you want fall under the 101 listing and they still have to fill out CPLT 101.  And Georgia Tech's equivalency confirmation system of course is going to lag behind curricular changes that Emory makes.  I remember when it took them a while to update the chemistry equivalencies after Emory changed that.  You'll be fine and the two offices probably communicate.",
