It then makes me fill in reasons for not going to oxford, but when i go to look at the drop down menus the text applies to dropping emory university as a whole. maybe it\u2019s not an error and i can just choose random ones but i don\u2019t want to mess anything up. I really hope someone is having these issues and can help me out.",
