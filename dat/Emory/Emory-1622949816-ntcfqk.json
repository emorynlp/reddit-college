  "title:": "Taking Math 211 for a psych major?",
  "text": "Hello, I am a psych that is considering minoring in QSS. However, the reviews for both math 211 professors are very poor and I was wondering if I should wait for a better/more lenient grader to teach the course or if the negative reviews are exaggerated and that putting in a normal amount of work will result in a good grade with the current professors.  I was also wondering if it is possible to transfer credit from another school to skip the QSS math 211 requirement and still get the minor? Thank you so much!",

      "text": "Do you want to take 211 for fun or are you considering a psych QSS concentration/major?:  \nhttp://quantitative.emory.edu/documents/checklists/fillable-QSS_minor_checklist_2020-5-11.pdf\n\nI don't see math 211 on this list and the major requires math 210.  My undwerstanding is that math 210 is just a challenging course by nature of the content but that Carr is actually solid as an instructor.  When you see those reviews, consider that these are mostly standard social science majors that are typically math averse taking a math course that blends calc. 2 and 3 and has a \"lab\".  The intensity alone (especially if the professor deliberately writes challenging assignments or exams, because something like a B-/B average is fairly common in STEM depts for lower division and other intermediate core courses).  \n\nAnd if that course is the foundation or pre-req of any upper divisions, you'll want the foundation from it to be useful and if they make it too easy, you might end up disadvantaged versus those who took the more rigorous version (I hear a few QTM courses curve which suggests they can be quite challenging and likely do expect students to be able to use and apply whatever foundation to the new material).",
