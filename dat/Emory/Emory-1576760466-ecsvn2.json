  "text": "Hey so I\u2019m a freshman at Emory who just finished his first semester. I\u2019m kinda disappointed by the fact that I only went to 2 parties so far. So my question is: how do you go to more parties? My friends aren\u2019t the party type so would it be ok to go alone? Also, is there a way to know where the parties are without having friends who know??",

Make more connections and friends and you\u2019ll easily be able to find events/parties to go to. also, on big nights like mansion or t&g or district, find people to pregame and postgame with",
