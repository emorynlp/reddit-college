      "text": "Here\u2019s my rundown:\n\nBest Value: Tea Leaf and Creamery -\nThe tea tastes fine and the boba can be a little iffy, but the main selling point is that the prices are reasonable and it\u2019s so close it\u2019s almost walking distance from Emory. So unless u wanna make the trek to Buford hwy, this is probably your best bet\n\nBest overall: Tan-Cha -\nThis place is the best boba I\u2019ve found in Atlanta. The tea tastes the most authentic to my Taiwanese taste buds and the boba is pretty good. Cons are that it\u2019s hella far and kinda expensive. Get the red jade or brown sugar (with foam) if u can go\n\nHonorable mentions:\nTea Top - I\u2019d say like a close second, pretty classic boba place\n\nKung fu tea - up there with tea top \n\nDing tea - go here if your aesthetic is round bottom boba cups ig\n\nSweet hut - tea is kinda meh but go here if u want baked goods (egg tarts are amazing)\n\nHoney bubble - underwhelming, but it\u2019s closer than Buford hwy\n\n\nAvoid boba theory at all costs.",
