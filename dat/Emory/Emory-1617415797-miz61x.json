      "text": "I am senior and willing to answer some questions: \n\nWhat\u2019s it like to be a first-year student here, in terms of advising or any classes that everyone has to take?\n\nAdvising is a little rough first year until you get to actual major advisor. I got a pre-major advisor in a completely different department than my area of interest and I made some mistakes in my first year schedule because of it. After that, advising is great! In terms of classes everyone has to take, I assumed you mean GERs, they are fine and usually pretty easy to fulfill. Obviously depends on your interests and strengths but nothing is super extensive. For example, I am a double major in Biology and English and these two together knocked out almost everything besides language, PE, and HSC. \n\nAre most classes taught by professors or teaching assistants?\n\nProfessors for sure. Very little are by TAs (mainly just lab classes for some sciences and a couple low level humanities courses).\n\nWhat do you wish you had known going into freshman year?'\n\nIt took  me awhile to find my place at Emory and that is common and ok. \n\nDo you like the food in the dining hall?\n\nIts so much better than it was my freshman year. The dining hall itself could be bigger but the food is amazing. \n\nWhat is your favorite and least favorite thing about the school?\n\nFavorite: extracurriculurs and opportunities that Emory brings. \n\nLeast Favorite: how divided the student body is",
