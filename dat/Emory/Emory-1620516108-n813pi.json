  "title:": "Spring admit at Oxford getting cold feet",
  "text": "Hi everyone, I recently accepted my offer to be a spring admit at Oxford next spring. Emory was one of my top choices, but now I am really struggling to reconcile with being a spring admit.\n\nI live in a very toxic household, and I thought I could hold down fort for a few more months but it\u2019s been getting really bad. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can tolerate my living situation.\n\nI\u2019ve already emailed my AO last month when decisions first came out and he said no to being moved to fall. Does anyone know if those taken off Oxford waitlist or spring admits will be given priority for fall if space allows?\n\nI am feeling really desperate and would do anything to get out of my household as soon as possible and go to college in the fall. Any advice would be greatly appreciated <3",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nFirstly I'm sorry about your situation at home. I am not sure about who gets priority for fall enrollment. What is an AO?\n\nI would advise calling Emory's Admission Office and explaining your situation at home. I think calling will get Emory's attention and Emory can get a more in-depth understanding of your situation.\n\nCan you go to another college in the fall if Emory doesn't allow you to enroll in the fall?",

I would instead emphasize the positive reasons for wanting to be a fall admit and that Oxford /Emory is your first choice but after much consideration you do not want to delay; you still want Oxford /Emory but starting in the fall has become a very important factor in your decision.",

Say that you are hoping to attend Oxford earlier (this fall) because of your living situation\n3. Tell the Emory staff about your living situation. \"My living situation is very toxic and especially during these last few months, my living situation has caused me a lot of suffering. For my well-being, it is crucial for me to get out of my parent's house\"\n4. Explain why Oxford College is important to you. \" Oxford has been and is the college that I want to attend. The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (talk about something you love) at Oxford is something I am looking forward to (for example, the small, close-knit community).\"\n5. Ask the staff member on call if there is a way to attend Oxford this fall. If they are unsure, ask the staff member for someone else you can talk to/email (for example, the Oxford Dean).\n6. Thank the staff member\n\nThis is how I would structure my call. Feel free to make any changes you feel are appropriate :)",
