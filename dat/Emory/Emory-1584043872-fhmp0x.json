  "text": "Greetings! Y'all don't know me but I am a Lutheran Pastor working at Emory.\n\nI do not have anything concrete as of this moment but there are churches organizing host families for students that need a place to go while campuses are shut down.  I cannot guarantee excatly how all this will play out but we are working to help find solutions during this time.   If you or anyone you know is struggling with where to go, no matter your background, faith tradition, sexual orientation or anything, for whatever reason please drop me a dm and we can chat.\n\nstay safe\n\nblessings",
