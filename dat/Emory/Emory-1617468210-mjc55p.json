  "text": "Hi! I was admitted to Emory\u2019s Class of 2025. Although I have an EFC of 0, I still need to pay around $2,400 out of pocket with a $2,200 work study and the rest was covered by grants. I was hoping that I could just easily cover that out of pocket cost with outside scholarships rather than from my parents because I don\u2019t want that strain on them and idk if they would be able to do it. Basically what I\u2019m asking is if anyone has had experiences with scholarship displacement at Emory. Would any outside scholarships I earn be able to cover this out of pocket cost or decrease the work study before my grants are decreased or taken away? Thank you!",

So I don\u2019t know about the work study aspect but I have external scholarships and they\u2019ve never taken away from any of my other aid or grants given by Emory! I would recommend finding out who your financial aid advisor is and reaching out to them because they\u2019ve always been very helpful for me!",
