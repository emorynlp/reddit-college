  "text": "Hi, I am a freshman right now and I am taking financial accounting this fall semester, and I am interested in taking Corporate Finance in the spring. Is this a good idea if I want to be able to do a finance internship during the summer or get a head start on my technical skills?",

      "text": "Apply for the business clubs that are really selective - GIMG, CYC, Atlas, AKpsi. (Actually, maybe not AKpsi but that's just my opinion). That'll help you get internships in the long run. Be mindful that most companies don't offer internships for freshman unless you have family connections or its through a diversity program.",
