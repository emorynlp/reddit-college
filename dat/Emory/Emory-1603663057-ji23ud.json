  "text": "Hey there guys,\n\n\nExcluding this year for obvious reasons, how would you guys rate your experience at Emory (including social life, parties, dating scene, academics, stressful ness/competitiveness, collaborative environment, professors, etc) \n\nRight now I\u2019m looking at Econ and maybe the business school once I\u2019m there but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll change. \n\n\nThanks",

              "text": "I don't know about all that, but they have a TRUE grading curve (like a distribution with specific % ranges for who can be assigned each passing grade bracket) be that can promote competition (not like sabotage and stuff but certainly more competition than straight graded courses or difficult courses that are adjusted upwards).  The problem is that they are allowed to effectively curve down vs. a normal scale when the courses assessments have unusually high averages.",
