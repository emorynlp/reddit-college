  "text": "Hello! I committed to the Columbia University Class of 2025 back in April, and I just got off the Emory University Atlanta Campus waitlist. I am having a hard time deciding between the two schools and I was hoping y\u2019all could provide some insight. \n\nIn terms of academics, I am not really sure how different they are. I\u2019m looking for a challenging and collaborative academic community, which both seem to fit the profile. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong though. \n\nAs for location, Columbia is located in the middle of the city, which means great access to opportunities off campus. However, would it be more dangerous? Emory seems a bit more closed off and located in the suburbs. \n\nMy prospective major is chemistry on a pre med track. \n\nThanks !\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nlvcvc)",

      "text": "This was adorable, but just take Columbia if only for the social capital especially if they are the same or similar price. You can be \"challenged\" almost anywhere IF you actually want that (plus we don't even know what you are interested in studying).  This isn't like some of the other elite, but not super elite sub-reddits on here.  Most of us Emory Eagles aren't delusional.  Currently, Columbia is the better pick (there \"may\" be some STEM areas where Emory at the UG level can compare, but still...)/is in the better position.  I don't know if it is very \"collaborative\" or whatever, but you can figure that out/find some people to work with when you get there. Maybe we'd have a different discussion in 15-25 years when you may want to send a child to college ;)",

A lot of other users pointed out that Columbia is way more prestigious than Emory, so it seems kind of odd that you would be committed to Columbia and still considering Emory. There must be something major pulling you towards Emory or away from Columbia, but you don\u2019t make that clear in your paragraphs.",

      "text": "Kinda late but I\u2019ll give my input. Columbia definitely has a different vibe than Emory. In terms of schools that match Emory\u2019s vibe, I\u2019d say we\u2019re most similar to JHU, Rice, WashU, Brown, Tufts, CWRU (although tbh don\u2019t know how accurate that is). There\u2019s definitely a difference if you\u2019re trying to compare how it\u2019s like at each campus.\n\nAnother thing, premed at Columbia is really stressful from what I\u2019ve heard and much more difficult compared to other schools (bio especially is notoriously tough there). I\u2019m pretty sure something similar is true for Penn & Northwestern. It\u2019s definitely a bit easier at Emory. That\u2019s part of the reason why I didn\u2019t try and transfer this year even though I had the stats to (besides just enjoying my professors, being happy with the friends I made, and just Emory overall), I\u2019m not sure if I would\u2019ve wanted to deal with a lot of additional stress. The other was that I loved the vibe here and I didn\u2019t see a huge difference in going to the other schools that matched it and I think a difference in prestige is not entirely the best reason to transfer anyways.\n\nIf you\u2019re an accomplished person and a great student, I wouldn\u2019t worry about the difficulty. Honestly, if I was a senior in your position I probably would choose Columbia too. It\u2019s generally good to choose the overall \u201cbetter\u201d school when you aren\u2019t sure, although if you really hate Columbia then maybe it\u2019d be better to go somewhere else. It doesn\u2019t seem like you do though so seems like an easy choice imo.",

          "text": "I feel like that's different as they are two very different schools in the \"super elite\" tier of schools that have real social capital associated with them.  Most elites outside of that tier have growing social capital, but nowhere near the same amount.  Plus in things like STEM, most schools within that tier follow the same patterns academically (lots of special programming, tiering of intro courses, etc. Believe it or not, not all \"elites\" are created equal there and the saying that \"well you learn the same things no matter where you go\" isn't really true).  Places with more money and stronger graduate programs have unique advantages in terms of what they can offer and the calibre of students they can challenge and serve because of those advantages) that most outside the group don't.  I kind of get what you mean though but I really feel the choice between those two is nowhere near as easy.",
