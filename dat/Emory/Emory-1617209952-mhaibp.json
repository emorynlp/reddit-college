  "text": "I'm going to be a junior next year and really really really hoping to live on campus. My roommate plans fell through and part of me wants to try for a single instead of living with someone mostly random, but I don't want to make it even less likely that I would get a room at all. Does anyone know how hard it is to get a single/how quickly they fill up, or if you can change plans to live with other people if all the singles are gone by your registration time?",
