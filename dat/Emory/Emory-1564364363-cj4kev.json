  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nAs we all know the old mods of this subreddit were extremely inactive. After a lot of Reddit requests, the sub has finally been reclaimed from them. I am currently the only mod but am talking to the mods of r/emoryU to figure out what to do next.\n\nIn the meantime, what new ideas do you all want to see around here? \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking so far:\n\n1. I\u2019m definitely going to revamp the look of the sub because now it is pretty bland (r/emoryU looks incredibly and I\u2019d honestly love to be an exact copy).\n\n2. Going to make user flairs so we can see what year you are in or if you are an alum. Maybe also an option to say your major (both are completely optional).\n\n3. Going to make some post flairs for questions, advice, memes, etc.\n\nBut what else are you all interested in? All input is welcome.\n\n\nEdit: \nMore ideas (from you all and more)\n\n4. Weekly/monthly Q/A threads (eventual FAQ)\n\n5. Event threads \n\n6. Upvote and downvote replaced with Emory eagle logo? (This is more of a fun one, might not be practical though)\n\nI\u2019m turning in for the night, hopefully I can do more tomorrow after my work \ud83d\ude42",

Could pretty easily just rebuild the css of emoryU.\n\nAside from that, maybe a calendar for events? And then a auto-mod thread that populates the week's events or something.\n\nYou could have a couple of weekly threads. Q&A, events going on, marketplace?.\n\nAlso maybe what would make more sense is more timing ones. Like there should be a stickied thread when signup is right around the corner for people to ask questions. Maybe one with distractions for finals week, etc. \n\nAnyways, good luck!",
