  "title:": "Is there an apparent stigma towards Oxford students of Emory and Oxford continuees?",
  "text": "[I came across an article from last year](https://emorywheel.com/oxford-emory-divide-requires-sga-action/) from The Emory Wheel talking about a perceived 'difficult' transition, both physically and mentally, that arises from Oxford students who move to the main campus their junior year. \n\nThis article is of course an Op-Ed from one person, so I was curious what the perspective was from other people here, hopefully both Emory 4-year students and Oxford students who continued onto Emory. In general, how are Oxford students viewed before and after they come to Emory? Is it harder for them to land in more prominent roles in say student government or in joining frats/sororities? \n\nFinally, do Oxford students tend to remain very close with each other once they arrive to Atlanta their junior year? I can imagine how it would feel for them to go from a very small, rural environment to now a medium-sized, sub-urban environment close to the main city.",

      "text": "I don't think it has to do with 'stigma':  It looks like they sometimes have a hard time with the Greek orgs(which is often one of the only things brought up) likely because they have to struggle to make early acquaintances with them (travel and all that), but it looks like they can get pretty good roles elsewhere, especially in certain student government roles.  But to be fair, I honestly think that Oxford students should be viewed the same as those who make internal transfers between undergraduate units at other schools or Emory for that matter.  The difference is, they are physically distal from main unlike say..the nursing or business school. You simply have to acquaint yourself with and maybe compete against new (and maybe established) people and organizations that are specific to ECAS, nursing, BBA units. \n\n I'm not sure how that could be mitigated completely, but if the student could adjust early enough and make connections with main, that could help them.  I also think Emory admins are privy to some issues and are trying to address them through the Emory Undergraduate project.  Particularly I think they are trying to have events that result in deliberate contact between main and Oxford students.\n\n\nPhysically and mentally? I mean, they are coming from something smaller than most 4 year LACs onto a medium sized university campus with grad. students and potentially larger courses (especially if they decided to save or are left to complete core courses in their pathway or major).  I imagine it can be a really serious transition no matter how well trained they were at Oxford in their academics, co-curriculars, and extracurriculars.  But with that said, many Oxford students really really thrive on main and they have great representation in top academic and service accolades at both the departmental and university wide level, so clearly a lot of them transition just fine.  \n\nAgain, do not interpret as a stigma.  They are simply physically distal from campus and establish 2 years of another life academically and in extracurriculars before continuing to a much larger student body and campus.  A decent amount are bound to have issues.  I don't know why people don't view them as physically distal internal transfers.  Most/hardly any people feel no type of way about them as a group.  They just have to assimilate to ECAS much like anyone else who didn't start there.\n\nClose-knit: As a certain special counsel investigator said over and over again: \"generally\".  However, I made quite a few friends with Oxford students and started from main.  I had different spheres of my social groups that originated from main do the same. We didn't care.  And at Emory, a lot of friends are often made through academics as opposed to purely social anyway so social networks aren't remotely limited to friend clusters formed outside the context of a classroom.  If you can be used for a study group, and seem nice enough, your origin and back story will be irrelevant.",

              "text": "They changed the name of the 'Emory Undergraduate Experience Initiative' which you can apparently see some tenets of on the Emory College website under the 'administration' tab.  I think it is really an outgrowth of a report they came out with years ago called 'Academic Engagement in Residential Education'.  So that was important but then it also looks like it has ultimately included lots of pretty serious undergrad professional development efforts too (like they rearranged and created a more official office of undergraduate research, came out with the Emory Edge thing, got that grant for the Humanities Pathways Project, and I suspect that common book reading thing being taken a little more seriously on the admins part is also a part of it).",

      "text": "I didn't have any trouble moving from Oxford to main campus, and I don't think anyone else I knew did either.  By the time you're starting your junior year, you've more or less made your friends and I think that's the case at both Oxford and Emory, so you show up at Emory already knowing like 500+ people and at that point you're not really looking to make new friends.  Joining frats and sororities is a weird process coming from Oxford but definitely not impossible, and I knew a bunch of girls in particular who rushed as juniors and joined sororities for their last two years.  \n\nAt the end of the day, everyone's an Emory student, everyone graduates with the exact same degree from Emory College (or B school, or nursing), it's just a matter of how you'd like to do your freshman and sophomore years.",

Some people may have a tough time with the transition, but it certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be the norm. \n\nHopefully someone from Oxford can provide some input as well (Emory College student btw)",

In addition to SGA, the current College Council and BBA Council presidents are also both headed by Oxford continuees. There are some ECAS students who are nicer and others who probably have more stigma toward the group. I've been talking to someone who is super understanding towards me and I'm in a club called EIRA that has a strong community between the campuses.",
