Both are hilly walks (Publix is almost completely uphill from Cmont) technically but there is kind of a way around that for the Kroger if you are going from main campus (there are these sporting fields past Greekrow that you can cut through that may ease it a little).  Or you can just go down Clifton until you get to this turn by Wesley woods hospital (wooded road.  This weird uphill bridge leads to the shopping center with Kroger.  It is actually a beautiful walk).\n\nWalking distance but not across the street.",

      "text": "The frequency of Grady(downtown) and Midtown shuttles are about the same during the summer.  I don't necessarily agree on the thing about MARTA EXCEPT weekends (they just do whatever then and almost intentionally run off schedule if I had to guess so it takes more planning).  If you wanna go downtown or to financial districts on weekdays, I think it is pretty reliable.  36 was always my best friend (even on weekends tbh) and would get into midtown quite fast (also goes through the highlands).  6 can give you a kind of long route to downtown (you'd take whatever train from Inman Park Station to downtown.But why do that when during lower/normal traffic hours, 36, Grady/Midtown can get you to the big districts in 20-30 minutes).  From there if you wanted to be downtown, you just take Gold or Red from midtown station to Five Points or Peachtree Center.  You could also get to Buckhead from there and 36 and the Tech shuttle goes to midtown station).  I never liked driving in Atlanta so finding out that those generally worked for me and were pretty damned fast was a blessing.\n\nEdit:  CCTMA runs regularly during summer, and will take you to Decatur station which is a pretty quick ride to downtown. \n\nAny of this stuff works during DAY time exploration.  Things get tricky at night (I'd say past 8 or 9 with MARTA buses) and basically useless for Emory shuttles.",
