  "text": "Hey all! Former USC alumnus of 2018 here (anonymous account). After dealing with anxiety my entire life where it became severe while in college, I decided to do something that I wish I had when I was desperately struggling in college.\n\nI'm building a community-based app that gives college students a safe, anonymous place to share personal things in a supportive and open environment with others at your school. It will be social and will be focused on sharing the difficult things in life with other students.\n\nI really hope to make a positive impact and help as many people as struggling in silence. I'm currently developing it and would love any and all feedback. \n\nIf you could take a couple seconds to fill out this 8 question survey, it really would mean the world to me. Thank you so much! :) \n\n[Survey link](https://forms.gle/UepWTP9tZAbkfTJ5A)",
