      "text": "Third floor has a few little rooms along the right side (facing from 260) but they're sometimes locked. You might get lucky, though.\n\nYou could of course chill in the Commons, though it might get a little busy. If they're not taken, the Fishbowls (the glass conference rooms on 2nd floor) could work.\n\nThe lab hallways on 2nd floor have little alcoves with desks.\n\nEvery floor has a lounge area on the side opposite 260. 4th and 5th are particularly good since few undergrads go up there.",
