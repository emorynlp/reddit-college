Without getting too personal, did life just sort of go awry this semester or did you just straight up find the classes hard (I know they may have definitely been rougher than online COVID bschool classes and I'm seeing many others have a tough adjustment to it)?  I'm just wondering what it is supposed to be like at the Euro university if it's the latter.  I just hear of content standards (especially outside of STEM) in terms of complexity being higher than most (even good) U.S. institutions even if there is less weekly workload.",

Again, I suspect you'll be fine even if it isn't the best grade.  The C+ and lower only goes to the bottom 20% in the worst case scenario.",
