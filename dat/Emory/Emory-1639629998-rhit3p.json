  "text": "Hi... I was accepted to Emory around 6 hours ago and during this time I have had a change of heart. All of those things I wrote in my essay about \"Changing The World\" and \"Curing Cancer To Avenge My Deceased Grandmother\" are not things I am passionate about anymore. I want to pursue my real passion for Investment Banking/Consulting/NFTs/Crypto-Currency/alcohol. Has anyone else made a similar switch, and if so could you give me advice?",

      "text": "You can't, the world needs you and your deceased grandmother to be avenged. I can't imagine living in a world where a potential pediatric cardiovascular oncosurgeon was stuck consulting instead. You must stay your course.\n\nThink about it. Every time you move you finger, you not only change the center of gravity of the world... you change the center of gravity of the *universe*. We need you.",

      "text": "You know how there are pre-college programs like Johns Hopkins CTY, Duke TIP, etc.? Well, I\u2019ll give you the best pre-college program. And best of all, it\u2019s much cheaper than the ones listed above. Here is the curriculum: \n\nStart off with evaluating your alcohol tolerance. Do you feel buzzed after one beer? Two? If so, you gotta get that tolerance up. \n\nSince beer is one of my favorite alcs, I\u2019m going to list the curriculum in beer. However, if you prefer a different alc, you can always convert accordingly. \n\nEvery day, set a \u201cbeer drinking target\u201d. For example, next week, aim to drink 3 beers a day. Slowly work your way up until you can drink 10 beers a day. Doing so will set you up for a great career in frat stardom and later down the line, a career in IB or management consulting! \n\nYou can thank me later.",
