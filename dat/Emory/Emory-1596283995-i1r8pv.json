      "text": "I took Ostrom for 202 and she was so nice and very helpful, and she's also the director of undergrad studies (I think?) and helps make the final so if she's teaching I would recommend! For 201 I had a grad student who I loved but don't think she's teaching again. I don't remember having any quizzes, mainly just exams (the midterm and final). The exams I personally found to be easy, so if you took 2+ years in HS, you should be okay. My friends who also took Spanish 201 (and 202) often agreed that they aren't very taxing courses. I will say I thought there was a lot of busy work for homework, but if you complete them you will likely do well in the class. For dictionaries, you can use them for your own discretion for homework, but for in-class stuff you're kinda expected to just go with the flow. If you don't know something, the prof will likely help you with whatever you're struggling with.",
