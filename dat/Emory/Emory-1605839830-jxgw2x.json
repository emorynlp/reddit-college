It seems like with the exception of a several classes, most sections don't have a waitlist option. Do they not open until add/drop/swap? Or does it mean that they've reached their limit?",

      "text": "There are some classes which don't have waitlists. These are generally small classes such as labs and seminars. However, given that the spring semester is going to be online, you might want to talk to the professors and see if they are willing to overload people. In any case, if someone in the class drops it during add/drop/swap, you might be able to get in.\n\nThere's also been an issue this semester about classes getting configured incorrectly in OPUS. I'm talking about cases where the maximum enrolment shown in the Atlas is much less than the actual maximum enrolment for the class or where the maximum enrolment for all the lab sections does not add up to the maximum enrolment for the lecture section. (For those of you who know what I'm talking about, it turns out that the issue got fixed.)",
