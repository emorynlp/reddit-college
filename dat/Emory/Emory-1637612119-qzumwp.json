  "text": "Is it worth it to join AKPsi as a freshman? I've heard that it was embroiled in some election-related controversy, plus the process of rushing is quite time-consuming. Based on what current members have told me (they all drank the kool-aid), the main benefits lie in professional development and 'the brotherhood'. \n\nWhat are some benefits that AKPsi offers that cannot be found elsewhere? How time-consuming is rushing?",

I am of the opinion that you can get the same experience, connections, and resources by getting accepted into one of the reputable investing or consulting clubs (Atlas, 180, CYC, etc)",

          "text": "Dude I got into ASCEND investment club, not even GIMG or Atlas and whatever, and I turned out just fine. The networking events are literally the exact same\u2014 same companies come over, same \u201c20 kids crowding around a speaker after the presentation\u201d,  etc. Getting into a club like GIMG or Atlas is like 75% just who you know in the club vs. actual skill\u2014 something that translates pretty well to the real world lol.\n\nAs for AKPsi, I literally saw people go through an entire semester of hazing, cramming for stupid tests at the expense of actual classes, and nervous breakdowns all to not get in at the end. Who the fuck wants to go through that lol.\n\nHonestly, I understand interviewing for clubs but most university professional fraternities just allow you to join lol. AKPsi was just way too extra (I never rushed, but it definitely doesn\u2019t look worth it at all).",

Or it\u2019s the hazing incident where a student cracked his head open after drinking too much. For a non social frat, they sure got into a lot of trouble recently lmao.",
