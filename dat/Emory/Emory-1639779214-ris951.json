  "text": "So I didn't do the greatest first semester, earning a 3.36 gpa. I mainly got screwed over by ACT 210, where I got a C+. What should I do to make sure I can still get into the B School junior year. I have good extra curricular and have transfer credit for the other bschool prereqs. Should I just focus on improving my gpa?",

          "text": "They look at an upward trend and resilience.  Do solidly in the rest of your classes, especially the business pre-reqs (B+ or higher) and try to get it up and above that. Start talking to a BBA admissions liason about what you probably need to do going forward outside of academics for yourself and b-school admissions and of course formulate a plan B/find something you enjoy in case the worst case scenario with regards to that does happen.  Your life will not end and there are many pathways to fulfilling and even lucrative careers without the b-school especially if you improve your academic performance.\n\n*Note that they'll also take rigor of courses (like if you tried weedout STEM or QTM track courses) into account. And they'll probably take contexts like a personal crisis as well.  Again reach out to pre-BBA advising and whatnot.",

                  "text": "Honestly, what I am suspecting is that the BBA program will be noticing a lot of downward trend blips even for people who started at ECAS or Oxford(but especially ECAS) because online courses had far more lenient grading even if they kept a similar rigor (in terms of assessment styles) or format overall, whereas now grading and syllabi have returned to something closer to normal.  But yes, that would be something you'd definitely want to ask them.  I just don't think you're the only one they'll see weird trends/grades from.  Most in person rendition of classes are simply much more challenging (during COVID, there was addition of busywork in a lot of classes, but if students completed it, they basically got full credit.  And tests were either eliminated or watered down substantially in major STEM and more quantitative social science courses).",
