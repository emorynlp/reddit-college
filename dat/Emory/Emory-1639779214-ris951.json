  "text": "So I didn't do the greatest first semester, earning a 3.36 gpa. I mainly got screwed over by ACT 210, where I got a C+. What should I do to make sure I can still get into the B School junior year. I have good extra curricular and have transfer credit for the other bschool prereqs. Should I just focus on improving my gpa?",
