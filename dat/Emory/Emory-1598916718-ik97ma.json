  "text": "Whenever I'm on a Zoom Call, the Emory WiFi just randomly fives out and disconnects me from the meeting. It only happens when I'm using Zoom, but my entire laptop just disconnects from the WiFi. I'm not sure how to fix it but it's becoming really annoying to have to keep reentering a class five times.",

Describe your problem in as much detail as possible. Mention you location, your operating system, and any other info you think is useful. (Like if it's only certain times of day.)",
