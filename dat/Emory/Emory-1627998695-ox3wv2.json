  "text": "Hello,\n\nI am an incoming freshman, and I am looking to enroll in ARTVIS 109 - Intro Sculpture or ARTVIS 105 - Intro Painting. I have never taken an art class before or have a particular talent for art; however, I would love to try, and it would count for GER. Would you recommend taking a visual arts class at Emory without prior experience, and what is the class like (workload, difficulty, etc.)?\n\nThank you!",
