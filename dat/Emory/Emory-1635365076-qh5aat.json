  "text": "I'm taking econ101 rn and while i'm not doing terribly bad, i'm not doing super good either (might end up with a B+ at the end with bonus points). \n\nAnyways, looks like on atlas there's only one teacher for fin201 next sem (steven ahn), and for econ there's ayogu, tao zha, daniel levy, and cheng ding. I heard for fin201 you get graded on 3 case studies, and it's graded kind of harshly. and for econ112, there's 3 main tests and no one is prepared for the final.\n\nany recommendations or advice for which one to take?",
