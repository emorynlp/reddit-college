  "text": "Is it doable? Distance wise it doesn\u2019t seem too bad but I don\u2019t know how friendly the roads are for bikers. I am looking to get an e-bike and explore atl as much as possible during my last year at Emory (I transferred to Emory my junior yr and only got to visit downtown twice, still have not visited aquarium and cocacola world) and hopefully go watch the hawks play at statefarm arena at least twice every month when nba season starts.",

But once you get to that path, it\u2019s smooth sailing. Downtown has actual separate bike lanes, so I\u2019d say as long as you\u2019re safe and comfortable with road riding, go for it!",
