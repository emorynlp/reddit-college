  "title:": "Transferring to Goizueta after 2 years of engineering??",
  "text": "I'm currently studying engineering at top 15 university without an undergraduate business program, and I've absolutely hated it. I know for sure that I don't want to enter the engineering field. Since I have no prior business experience, I figured Emory's BBA program might be a good fit for my situation. But since Emory is so liberal arts focused, do you think I'd have a chance at getting admitted to the program?",

      "text": "You might be able to get in to Emory, but then you have to complete all the business pre-reqs and most of the GERs before you can actually apply to the BBA program itself. Almost every Emory student who does all the pre-reqs with decent grades gets accepted to the b-school. Getting accepted to Emory will be the real hurdle, and I very much doubt you'll be able to graduate in 4 years. You'll probably need an extra semester to be honest, if not an extra year.",

      "text": "Does this \"top 15\" (I don't get why people say it as if it's a special tier. Really only the historical T10 are) have Gen eds. that translate well to Emory's.  Also, does it offer like a minor that has courses that may satisfy a b-school pre-req equivalent.  If not, definitely get your economics courses out of the way and get some of the writing requirements if you have them.  Also, are you sure that you hate engineering versus whatever school?  Maybe an engineering intensive school that has more relevant curricular options (I'm thinking of your Georgia Techs) that could be potentially blended with business/entrepreneurialism may be of interest.  At this point, it is hard to pivot to even a 2 year business program and graduate on time and this may very well affect Emory's admission decision.  Are you absolutely sure that you can't stay at your school and maybe do an economics major and a minor in business or something?  I'm just throwing that out there.  Also, is there an affinity for Emory specifically or are you just looking to stay at another \"prestigious\" school that isn't the current school?  It is possible that many less prestigious places may meet your needs and make you happier.",
