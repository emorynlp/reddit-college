      "text": "Apparently the candidate was accused of misconduct and people wanted an investigation opened. \n\nI do feel that SGA should just release a statement addressing the situation because seeing all those insta stories of people saying \"vote no confidence\" was hella confusing, especially if you're not on campus and don't know what the heck happens there half the time. \n\nI get where people were coming from, and I definitely agree that the situation should be investigated and elections postponed if what I heard was true, but it doesn't help the situation to make weirdly vague statements encouraging people to vote \"no confidence\" without explaining why we should vote \"no confidence.\"",

      "text": "A member of the community might be in the process of filing a Title IX complaint against the uncontested presidential candidate. While there is no active investigation, there are allegations against the uncontested presidential candidate. Several members of the student body have spoken out against electing this candidate until the allegations have been investigated, especially the club OxSAPA. Chalk messages appeared all across campus citing rates of  sexual harassment against women, as well as encouragement for the student body to vote *no confidence.* Many of these messages were washed off with water, presumably by supporters of the uncontested candidate.",

          "text": "Sexual harassment and assault was a problem in my 2 years at Oxford. There was a group of dudes who were outgoing and social on campus but later got accused of rapes. The Ox soccer team was also really sketch, they used to openly talk a girl's body while passing her in residential halls saying stuff like oh yeah I like her legs. So cringe, and the frustrating thing is that those guys who did the rapes didn't get kicked out (one of them I know for sure actually raped a girl at a party).",
