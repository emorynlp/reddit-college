      "text": "I took several continued writing credits with Dr. Robbins in the religion department focusing on the New Testament and loved them. I also took 19th and 20th century philosophy after taking one 100 level philosophy course and enjoyed it, but I probably would have gotten more out of the class if I had a better foundation in philosophy before jumping straight to 19th-20th century stuff.",
