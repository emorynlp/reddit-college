      "text": "You can technically kick the calc. Can down the road(it isn't a foundation for most majors premeds take on) if you want or maybe feel out chem and bio (I need to remind people that the intensity of chem and bio are quite a bit different pre-Covid. Most Covid online and in person classes were slowed/truncated content wise, had defanged assessments, and also deweighted midterms and finals. Either way be wary of people who attest to doability of those 2 plus calc. They may have taken the Covid versions which were sort of a step or more down from normal intensity).",
