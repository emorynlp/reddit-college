      "text": "Probably won't help if you can't keep a strong GPA in courses that help with the MCAT.  If you do well, it does seems that Emory takes a lot of the solid (so not perfect) performing applicants from ECAS. Though admittedly it seems like rec. letters or strong grades from certain STEM professors at Emory is a positive signal (tons of former Soria, Weinschenk, Spell folks end up there but then again, those instructors select more heavily for stronger students).\n\nAnd no on the GPA.  Your GPA starts over and the med. schools will request transcripts from all colleges/universities you attended and evaluate those performances.  Emory doesn't have an A+ so the highest you can get is a 4.0 which is possible, but unlikely, especially if you take better courses than what you did at GSU.  \n\nAnd if you don't plan on doing that, stay at GSU. Save the money and maybe, if you find academics too easy for you there, start buying and using MCAT prep materials early to offset any effect of taking courses that aren't strong enough to prep for that style of test.",

              "text": "It is really important because if you have done multiple choice in your college STEM classes or even short answer, often the level of those (especially the multiple choice questions) items given by the instructor are very basic in comparison to the level of questions associated with MCAT passages (even some of the free standing questions).  They are often simple questions that don't require much reading, sifting through and picking out content from the irrelevant, analyzing data, etc. So even a person who did well in their courses and can regurgitate the content well may not adjust but so well to the demands of MCAT questions.  \n\nMost college instructors either don't know how to or don't have time to write good multiple choice questions that test higher ordered cognitive skills.  Admittedly an excellent bio class to take at GSU that emphasized those higher ordered skills is the Anatomy and Physiology sequence which is case based.  I was ochem TA for some students in it some years ago and have to admit that it was one of the few courses that was superior to the rendition offered at Emory (I say that with sadness). But otherwise, the MCAT prep materials will help you get used to those types of items.",
