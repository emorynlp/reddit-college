      "text": "Depends on the division.  STEM and more quantitative social science courses (like economics) courses will probably go back to normal pace and have similar test weightings and difficulty (more weighted and more thinking intensive-For example, bio tests can have more figures and data interpretation style problems because they don't have to deal with glitchy Canvas software.  Same goes for chemistry) to normal in person years. I can definitely tell you that based upon what I saw, \"most\" highly enrolled STEM courses (especially pre-med cores) were taken down at least a notch (and those who saw older exams in certain profs' courses could probably vouch) vs normal years. Classes in many social sciences (and maybe even business courses as the b-school may have better infrastructure to deal with the demands of online teaching and assessment more so than the College, but I don't know, if you are in the b-school, ask how online compared to what in person stuff was in the past if they know) probably didn't change all that much (they were already writing assignment and discussion intensive).  The question shouldn't be \"will they be harder?\" vs. \"will they go back to normal?\"(which indeed, vs. online may be objectively more intellectual demanding).\n\nDifference is that more people will have the time, mental energy, and proper environment to adjust their efforts accordingly.  Had some professors done what they usually do(which also would have been overly demanding on THEM given that for younger professors or those with younger children, things like childcare were probably a nightmare in Georgia, so work-life balance was harder.  They may have wanted to further reduce the effort required for stuff like grading and thus reduced demands on students/gave assessments that were easier to grade), huge chunks of students would have been blown away under Covid conditions. Like no one in a normal year have been expecting things like gen. chem and bio to have most people getting like B+ (or even A-) and higher when the course usually targets a B- or B average.\n\nThey took the weighting off of the exams and/or even made the exams easier than standard years to take into account the circumstances and what many were dealing with at home which makes sense.  You'll be okay in an in-person so don't sweat it.  You get easier access to TAs, Office hours, libraries, friends, etc and usually in-person interactions and socialization can be more productive so you should be able to rise to whatever standards more easily even if they are higher.",

              "text": "You'll be okay.  Even sophomores (and some juniors) will be dealing with it.  If you are pre-BBA, social sciences, or humanities, it may not be as big of an adjustment.  The classes of the latter two can be a lot of work but if you use the resources (like the writing center and your professor) and produce decent work, they often grade fairly leniently,  If you are in STEM, even in the watered down Covid times, due to the conditions, many people probably felt like they were having a normal transition/shock therapy.  Remember that everyone basically went through virtual learning so will be having the same adjustment unless they went to some insanely rigorous HS (which some did for sure, but definitely not all or even most).\n\nAnd if you are in STEM (or in a more quantitative than average or tougher social science course), remember that they \"target\" certain course GPAs but will adjust grades upwards(and never downward) if needed to meet that target which means that if y'all are stinkin' it up as a cohort (vs. other in person semesters), it'll be taken into account in a way that doesn't hurt y'all.  In such a case just know not to obsess over raw scores (when the professor is intentionally challenging the students, do NOT expect to see all grades 90 or even 85 and above on things like exams.  These aren't designed like HS where the exams are just the problems you practiced with slightly different wording or numbers. They are trying to use at least a couple of items to push people to think sort of independently/figure things out so they don't expect mostly 90s-100s and adjust grading scales accordingly), just be on or somewhere above the average and you'll probably get at least some sort of B.  And then classes like biology, depending on who you take, may have lots of low stakes grades that buffer against a low scoring exam.",

I\u2019d imagine intro courses are going to go back to normal, meaning a different way of covering content + exam weighting might make them more challenging. Maybe classes that weren\u2019t traditionally hard (such as certain English or other humanities classes) might be of a similar difficulty.",

      "text": "As someone who had in person and online classes at Emory, I think it will be different but not necessarily harder. I will say the averages pre-pandemic for Biology and Chemistry classes were much lower. However, the challenges of finding a study space and concentrating will hopefully be resolved next semester.",
