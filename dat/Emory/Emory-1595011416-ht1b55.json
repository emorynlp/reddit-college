I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s some info I\u2019m missing that can change my mind and make it worth it to head on over. I want to go to atl but is it worth it to pay the money and sit in my dorm taking online classes?",

That combined with the take-out meal plan essentially means you\u2019d be sitting in your room all day every day. If I were you I would either defer for a year or just take online classes from home in the hopes  that the Spring will be better.",

You'll be social distanced and it'll be harder to meet friends. The way Georgia is doing with coronavirus even if u go to campus there's a good chance enough will catch it that you'd be sent home a few weeks into the year anyways and thus have wasted money on room/board.",

      "text": "Hey! This is def an important decision that you should discuss with your parents but I will say going to campus is one of the best ways to meet other students and make friends. Interacting with other students my first year was the highlight of my first year (I'm a rising sophomore). Zoom is just not the same, especially since you will be adjusting to college for the first time. As a second year, I feel more okay about not returning to campus bc I have already made friends and I'm close w them and call them often. But as an incoming student, meeting your classmates through zoom might feel isolating and you may not feel as close to them. Being on campus, seeing other in person (although mostly at a physical distance) will help build stronger bonds. You may find it difficult to adjust to college or meet people (since they may already have formed friend groups) if we are able to go back later.\n\nIn the end, this is a big financial commitment so please weigh the pros/cons and think about what your Emory experiential expectations are!",
