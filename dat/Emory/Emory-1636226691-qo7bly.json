      "text": "I'm curious what people will say but be careful how you interpret things.  I will bet you that people will still have different opinions based on experience (like with R and other programs they may have had exposure to) and past course schedules: If a person has taken laid back 3 and 4 hour courses before 150 and 150 feels similar, of course they'll say what you heard but the credit hour system at Emory and most places isn't really supposed to correlate with workload (and yes I know there are general per hour recommendations on how much time should be spent on a course but these recommendations were more relevant before grade inflation and lower intensity courses took over many departments starting in like the 80s. So many of these courses labelled 3 hours today may be much less intense than equivalent or analogous offerings a while ago) but contact/meeting hours.  The example is how CWR classes now get an extra hour for being that because there is supposed to be workshopping and frequent meetings with professors to develop the paper(s) outside of the class sessions. Whether this happens or is mandated in all of them is a different story.\n\nIt is kind of like the lab (and 150/151 are like labs/workshops apparently) thing: people ask why certain 2 hour STEM labs feel like the lecture or are more intense when I remember things like bio lab when it was worth the equivalent of 1 hr (25% of a 4 hour integrated lecture/lab) feeling like the lecture.  So when I ran into 2 hour upper division labs or optional labs for upper division courses claiming 1 hour, I expected it to at least be a lecture course worth of work with a certain amount of in class time per week (like maybe twice or longer than 3 hrs per session in 2hr labs).",

          "text": "Yep the biggest time sink determinator  for this class is if you can code already/ willing to learn to code outside of class. A lot of people come in not realizing the debugging and googling you have to do, even if they teach you the basics in class. And if you don\u2019t already know how to problem solve tech wise, it can be a little difficult to keep it as a \u201c1 credit class\u201d.",

Obviously there is going to be a disparity in the amount of hours spent on schoolwork of say a chemistry major vs. a film major, but credit hours should at least be a consistent measure of work within a department. \n\nI should be able to predict what each credit hour feels like within a department consistently, especially my own major as to help with my course scheduling. Otherwise, the utility of credit hours diminish and I can just look at the amount the class meets, but then that fails to serve the purpose of it being a graduation requirement. The number of hours a class meets != how much effort is exerted for the class (i.e. 400+ Theoretical Math Class meeting twice a week vs. Spanish 101 meeting 4 times a week).",

                      "text": "I can see that for sure, which is why I don't know why Emory couldn't find some other unit system other than the \"Carnegie\" which I personally think they are loosely interpreting versus other schools whether it is under-assigning credits for some courses or over-assigning credits for others.\n\nAlso the 2nd paragraph resonates but hasn't been how college worked in a while lol.   The disparities between departments (or even sections of a course) in terms of workload and grading standards are so vast that it is hard for credit hours to mean anythings in terms of workload because professors just do what they want to do and a lot of the less intense departments are ultimately responding to market pressures (like why would anybody major or enroll in  social science or humanities areas if it the career options and paths aren't as cut and dry AND they grade and give workloads similar to STEM?  In a consumer/buyer driven market, they'd lose their advantage and their enrollments would decline even further and more people will just \"risk\" pursuing STEM whether they were good in it HS or not.  In fact, I think Emory is seeing some of that with the advent of QTM).  Like I think there would have to be a new paradigm where faculty and students make the credit hour system make sense, but it can't because there are more forces at play that go beyond us.\n\nLike I can only comment on how things are NOW, and how people should learn to interpret them and not how they should be.  This credit hour and workload prediction stuff might make more sense if Emory didn't cost 70 grand a year and have maybe half of its students paying a significant chunk of that.  If most people were heavily discounted, then 3 hour classes may be more uniform because a say....social science or humanities professor wouldn't have to worry about upsetting paying \"customers\" for being as intensive as their 3 hour STEM courses.  But today, in the current environment, that isn't how it works.  Now in the case of a QTM 150/1 where only 1 hour is assigned, if it did mirror the intensity of many 3 hour STEM lectures, then that might be worth arguing to administrators or a department chair.  Like use the logic of the CWR courses: \"Hey I know we only meet this number of times in class/lab, but the amount of work/time spent on it outisde is pretty comparable to the amount of work in chem 150, bio 141, CS 170, whatever\" (I actually don't think it is versus the syllabus I saw.  Those classes have lots of formal graded HW and a lot of ungraded problems and exams and stuff that make for a more constant \"time on task\" paradigm, a steady wave of work you need to do to get a B or higher).  Maybe one could argue for something like 2 hours for QTM 150/1 though ((to me it looked more like the workload of 2 hour labs, but I guess those are two hours because they meet once for 3hrs+ and then the out of class workload is similar to a 150/1).",

If you\u2019re coming in with no coding background whatsoever, it\u2019s definitely going to take more work to learn and catch up but I personally think it\u2019s worthwhile.",

      "text": "I've personally taken 150 in my second year as a CS major. I'll be honest, I didn't watch lecture and spent an hour at most on the hw. I also was a second year CS major who worked with Python (a very similar language with a very similar use case) for almost a year at that point. \n\nI don't think it was a difficult course at all, and I often forget that I took it lmao. But if you're someone with no real programming experience, this course will stretch your noggin more than expected. The statistics done in the class are elementary, the programming is also elementary but it's such a different paradigm that if you're not familiar with it you will experience a shock. How much time it takes you to cope depends on your aptitude as well as who you have around you.",
