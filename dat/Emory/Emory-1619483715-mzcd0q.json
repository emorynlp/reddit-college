  "text": "Does Emory allow incoming freshmen to take classes online for a year? I live pretty far away from the university and my parents want me to stay home for another year; I will be helping my brother graduate from community college, get a job, play music with a community band, and continue to gather new experiences. I want to set foot on the Atlanta campus next fall, will that be allowed? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "Email your OUE advisor when you get assigned to one. Emory usually requires first and second years to pay for a meal plan and housing, although there is an exception for commuter students\u2014 technically I suppose if your classes are entirely online you could stay home but you wouldn\u2019t be saving any money (which I assume is what you are trying to do) since you\u2019d still have to pay those additional expenses. Emory is making exceptions for international students next year that are not able to come into the country but those will most likely be the only extenuating circumstances that they will allow. Emory is planning on moving most classes to in-person for the fall (the current course atlas is not updated) so if all the classes you want to take are in person I doubt you\u2019ll be able to take them online (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a domestic student) since Emory seems to be extremely adamant on a in-person and residential academic environment.\n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve already thought about the social and academic consequences of not being present on campus when 99% of students would be so I won\u2019t go into it but do remember that depending on your career aspirations not being on campus could potentially impair your success\u2014 specifically if you are planning to do research or go into the business school for IB/ consulting.",
