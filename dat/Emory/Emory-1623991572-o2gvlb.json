  "text": "what do people recommend for getting around on campus, preferably relatively faster and safely? i know campus isn't big enough for walking to be burdensome between classes but i was on campus last fall and spring and quickly realized i'm a pretty slow walker especially with that hill up/down dickey drive. any suggestions on faster transport? i'm mainly concerned with getting from harris to all those clustered buildings near white hall, and to the dct. also have one 15min transition from schwartz center to woodpec which i'm kinda seriously worried about. any suggestions plz :-)",
