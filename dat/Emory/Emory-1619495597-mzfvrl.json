  "text": "I\u2019m a incoming spring admit who was recommended by my advisor to take Bio 141 and chem 150 during my first semester at Oxford next spring to keep up with my pre med requirements. Is this a good idea? I\u2019ve taken AP chem before and got a 5 but I don\u2019t want to use credits for that class to get a stronger foundation and I\u2019ve taken honors bio but not AP bio.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Maybe Oxford is an exception, but I don't know if you are going to get a \"stronger foundation\" by taking chem 150 (or if you do that, make sure whoever you take is rigorous enough to ensure that or else you are wasting a semester on a class that may, for all you know, make you weaker vs. those who took another instructor or even moved on with their AP credit).  I'm just throwing that out there.  It covers the ochem stuff towards the end, but you'll see/review that same stuff again in 202 and 203 in a more relevant context, and arguably AP is probably more aligned with 202 in many ways.  Now what I would say is that if you are very uncomfortable with the structural aspects of chemistry (like drawing Lewis structures and resonance structures), then it certainly makes sense to take 150 if you can't reteach that to yourself quickly.  I can't comment on bio there but it looks fairly intensive so if you double in 150 and 141 or 202 and 141, maybe keep the remainder of your schedule somewhat light. You may also wanna take 202 (since you are going in spring) just to keep your courses in register with most of your cohort members (and to have access to the stronger instructors for it) who started in fall.",

      "text": "1. I took BIOL 141 and CHEM 202Z at the same time (also took ap chem and not ap biol, but I decided to use my credit for chem) last fall and I thought it was completely fine in terms of workload and difficulty. This could be different for Oxford, or different for CHEM150, but I would say as long as you have decent time management and do not overload on the rest of your classes, it should be fine (plus, a lot of premed freshmen double up on these courses!).\n\n2. This may not be the case for Oxford, but I was under the impression that BIOL 141 and CHEM 150 are only offered in the fall? I may be wrong, but if this is the case, you could potentially use your chem credit to be able to take chem 202 in the spring and just do BIOL 141 the next fall (staggering the courses like this is also what I\u2019ve seen people do).",

          "text": "Oxford is much smaller so offers most gateway STEM courses in alternate semesters.  Also, I don't necessarily like comparing classes directly across the two because general biology has had a lot of the \"fire\" taken out of it at ECAS (and is still very intensive at Oxford, especially the lab component) and 202-z was likely taught by Jui who always seemed as if he was not trying to challenge students.  It is possible that standard 202 or even 150 would end up a more intense course at either campus than his rendition of 202-Z.  I'm not saying it would be anything like 203 with McDonald (or anyone for that matter), but he is sort of abberational and gen. bio at ECAS just doesn't seem to compare to biology at Oxford (in fact, Oxford still has the old curriculum for biol 141/142 which is arguably pretty tough for many, especially 142. The two were probably more comparable before ECAS switched to the new thing).",

                  "text": "Yeah 264 overlaps with the old curriculum at ECAS so it was always that way. In my opinion the content in 264 is NOT the most important part of it. The most important part is the discussion section whether you like them or not. That is most important for the MCAT or going to grad. school. Reading lit frequently and learning more classical and new techniques/how people discovered stuff is the most important aspect.",
