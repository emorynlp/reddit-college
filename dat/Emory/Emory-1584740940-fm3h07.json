  "text": "I called student health with the possibility of having covid-19 and they said that they don't have a testing kit to really test anyone thus cannot prove that I have the virus. Their best recommendation is that I self quarantine and go to the ER when my shortness of breath gets worse. I don't know if I will ever get tested and my symptoms recover or get worse. The fact that I cannot get tested even with clear symptoms is really bothering me.",

How did the other three students get tests, do you know? \n\nAlso, it really sucks you\u2019re sick. I hope your shortness of breath doesn\u2019t get worse and you don\u2019t have to go to the ER.",

It sucks, especially when other countries seem to be doing so much better at it.\n\nEven if you got tested and it turned out you had the virus, they would have told you the same thing: self-quarantine for 2 weeks and go to the ER if you can't breathe.",

Sadly, it sounds like a lot of Emory students have the virus and can\u2019t get tested. You should stay in contact with student health for help with your quarantine situation and updates on your symptoms. Eventually, they may deem you necessary for one of the limited tests.",

The week after spring break I called student health services saying I traveled to a busy area over break and they called me back immediately telling me to come in and get tested. I refused, as I didn't have any symptoms and knew kits were in low supply, however they told me they have plenty of kits for on campus residents.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn fact, the head of the CDC, Robert Redfield made a guarantee TWO WEEKS ago before it spiked in the US to allow testing for every American free of charge:\n\n[https://thehill.com/homenews/house/487477-house-democrat-katie-porter-confronting-cdc-director-at-hearing-goes-viral?jwsource=cl](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/487477-house-democrat-katie-porter-confronting-cdc-director-at-hearing-goes-viral?jwsource=cl)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that we're a leading healthcare university and we can't even test our own is a disgrace. Anyway, I hope you begin to feel better and stay in good spirits!",

If you are having difficulty breathing, go to the ER (but call before you go and let them know you think you have COVID) \n\nThe positive test doesn't change your treatment. I'm sorry you are feeling sick and I hope you start to feel better",
