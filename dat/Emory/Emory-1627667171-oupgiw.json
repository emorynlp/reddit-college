  "text": "I\u2019m going into my senior year of highschool and starting to get serious about looking at colleges. Emory is in a good location and seems to be a great school but is remarkably expensive and Hope/ZM won\u2019t be doing much if anything. Im wondering what amount of students tend to get scholarships and how much that typically covers. Any information you guys could give would be great. Thanks!",

      "text": "I would not count on Emory's merit aid. These are long shots for even the best candidates and are usually reserved for students that could have gone to other universities with sizeable student aid.   \n\n\nIf I were you, I would look into Emory's need-based aid. Emory has committed to no low income (defined as less than 100k or something like that) student will graduate with student debt. That means that they will find grant money and work study to help you pay whatever they determine that your family cannot afford. This is the reason that people claim that your financial aid can change year to year, your family contribution is determined by family income. If your family makes more, they can (supposedly) pay more and your financial aid is adjusted accordingly. The reverse is also true. Your most reasonable estimate will come from the office of financial aid. They will also be able to give you a better estimate than any of the merit based aid personnel will be able to give you \"chances\".",

      "text": "Really depends on how competitive you are as an applicant. I can speak strictly to merit based scholarships: there is the Emory opportunity award (~15K) and the full scholarship for incoming freshman and a handful others. You could also look at external scholarships but likely other people have a better idea of this than I do. Then as a freshman you can apply again for a chance to win the full scholarship through the Deans Achievement Scholarship. Even if you aren\u2019t selected to get the full scholarship, If you are a finalist you receive ~10K. Check out this link for more details https://studentaid.emory.edu/undergraduate/types/emory-college/grants-scholarships/institution.html. Fin aid is always tough but the office is often generous enough to honor your appeals so I would give it a shot regardless.",

Don't look at the ticket price; use estimated family contribution (EFC) calculators to approximate it. Emory to my knowledge meets 100% of demonstrated need (as calculated by FAFSA/CSS Profile), so the EFC calculator will better approximate cost.",
