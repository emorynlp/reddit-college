  "text": "okay so I'm a freshman so registration was pretty new to me... BUT GUESS WHAT NO ONE TOLD ME THAT IF YOU ENROLL IN THE SAME CLASS BUT DIFFERENT SECTION THAT IT WOULD KICK YOU OFF THE WAITLIST????? so without knowing this, on Monday, I enrolled in the waitlisted class math 111, which is from 1:30-2:15 or smth. pretty nice time right? i thought so too, which is why I was pleasantly surprised when it told me that i was #4 on the waitlist. then i thought, \"i should probably enroll in another open math class in case i don't get off the waitlist,\" so the next day on Tuesday, i enrolled in the same class, math 111, but from 5:30-6:45 instead. kind of an undesirable time for me since it's when i eat dinner, but i thought it would be fine since i thought i was likely to get off the waitlist from the first class.\n\nThen the next day i email emory asking why i cant click the \"show waitlisted classes\" button on opus, and then they told me......\n\n**THAT IT KICKS ME OFF THE WAITLIST IF I ENROLL IN A DIFFERENT SECTION CLASS**\n\nlook, i don't know if that was common knowledge and that im dumb, but i did a lot of research into registration beforehand since i was so nervous, and i didn't see anyone say that??\n\nanyways, i'm now stuck with a late class from 5:30-6:45. maybe im complaining too much since i only have one class tuesday, two classes thursday, and no class friday, but i'm genuinely kind of upset that it kicked me off a good spot on the waitlist and put me in a class so late :(",
