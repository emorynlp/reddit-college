  "text": "Has anyone tried to take a Safe Ride to an off-campus area? Like, Clairmont Reserve, for example?\n\nI have to stay on campus until pretty late on Wednesday, and I'm a little nervous about walking at night. I know Safe Ride can go to the Clairmont Campus, but would it be able to go all the way to Clairmont Reserve?",
