      "text": "Singles are limited and generally in demand for second years. First dibs go to students with medical reasons for needing a single. Emory scholars then get priority housing registration and may claim singles. Assuming you are not an emory scholar and do not have a medical reason for a single room, getting a single depends on being lucky with the housing lottery and getting an early selection time when singles are still available.",
