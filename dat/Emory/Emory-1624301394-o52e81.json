  "text": " \n\nHi guys. I am a rising sophomore here at Emory. I have a survey on the effectiveness of counseling. I would really appreciate it if you guys could fill it out! Also I am looking for volunteers to participate in a study where I would provide counseling. This would be an informal session where I will try my best to listen and provide non judgmental advice. With my past struggles with my mental health, I believe that one of the largest issues in mental health is a lack of access to resources for those struggling. I hope this study can help some of those who find themselves in this situation. \n\nIf you would not like to receive counseling but wish to complete the survey, the link is down below. Thanks!\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please DM me and complete this google form.\n\nThanks for reading and have an amazing day! \n\nSurvey/Google Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq-a0OZxtiKQgwXv9g9ClnobxQENcy26s4gfPJITLXahiEqw/viewform?usp=sf\\_link",
