  "text": "Hi everyone, would appreciate any advice:\n\n3 weeks ago I reached out to a professor in my major for a permission code & was given one. However, I have registration at 6, and the class has remained closed. On OPUS it says the current enrollment is already greater than the maximum enrollment and there\u2019s no waitlist. Now I\u2019m confused, should I assume the class will not reopen at 6 and that it\u2019s filled? Can I reach out and ask the professor if he\u2019ll overload me since he gave me a permission code? I was under the impression that getting a code secured your spot but it appears that is not true",
