  "title:": "Super apprehensive and not excited about returning to campus after being off-campus all this year",
  "text": "I decided this year that I was going to seek out some new cool experiences after Emory (Oxford) decided not to let sophomores back on campus in the fall. I moved in with some friends in Michigan and I had a super great time and met all sorts of great people, but now I\u2019m worried my decision was wrong. \n\nI\u2019ve been in classes all this year but I\u2019ve felt super un-engaged with the Emory community. I\u2019ve dropped multiple of my executive positions because there was absolutely no opportunities for me to be involved once most sophomores went back to campus in the spring. Now, I have kept in contact with about 3 people total and I\u2019ve had to choose random roommates for next year, and I\u2019m super worried my time next year is going to be miserable. I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on so much and I barely even feel like I go to this school anymore. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone else who has spent their time this year off-campus has any similar experiences or if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this. Also, if anyone here has also had to choose random roommates as an upperclassman and your experiences with that. It feels super shitty to not have a group of friends to room with as a fucking junior.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m an Oxford student. The last time I was on campus I was a freshman at Oxford and the next time I\u2019ll be on campus I\u2019ll be a junior at the Atlanta campus.",

      "text": "I actually think you're gonna have a lot of fun.  I became friends with my roommates in the URC, a couple who were seniors even though they were randomly selected.  Senior year I pulled friends in.   Though living at C-mont did put you a distance away from main campus with all the action, fun things did happen there and I still had access to my friends(closer/original) in other units.  Keep an open mind about this seriously. Junior year was one of the funnest years I had despite the rooming situation (in fact it may have been BECAUSE of it).  I had great friends, new friends, good courses, was involved with what I wanted to be involved in, and took advantage of what was happening in Atlanta and on campus.  \n\n Try not to get hung up on this rooming stuff and do not make assumptions about what will happen with it and remember that you can probably catch up with others and make more friends (I get Emory folks can be clicquey and have a \"no new friends\" attitude, but sometimes its an impediment to enjoying yourself).",

I have made no friends this past year (because how do you make friends on zoom??) and I was assigned a roommate at random for next semester and I\u2019m so nervous about living with someone I\u2019ve never met. \n\nIf you want to meet up at the beginning of next semester so we both know at least one other person, please feel free to hit me up lol.",

              "text": "Okay, wonderful. I would do the research on where you would want to go and finding a well-rounded reason for wanting to transfer. Not having friends won't go over well with most admissions officers. Also, you will be technically transferring to the main campus from Oxford so any social issues you would have on the Atlanta campus you would also have elsewhere so again make sure your essays reflect a good reason to transfer.",
