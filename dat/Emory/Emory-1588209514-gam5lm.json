      "text": "Well as the other guy here said it may be different this year. But the best dorms are Raoul and LSM, but overall most are good and way better than you\u2019re average college dorm. Complex and Dobbs aren\u2019t great but they\u2019re only bad in that they are the typical college dorm, while the rest are really nice. \n\nFor me what I heard was that if you put more eco-friendly answers it increases your odds of getting into one of the newer halls, especially Raoul which is all about being eco-friendly (every hall has a theme). I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s really true but I did it and ended up in Raoul so maybe it helped?",

              "text": "I have to wonder if they did that because they changed the themes of the halls or because they are doing some new model where they just untheme the halls but expand the amount of immersion communities.  I think they probably got the picture that students who weren't applying to those communities never cared about the themes anyway. Naturally, they just exploited it to get the newest/nicest dorms which of course just makes sense (I mean a lot of the themes are unfamiliar to students anyway).  This basically sounds more like a random roommate match up for those applying outside of those things.",

If you have a choice go LSM or Raoul, but you won\u2019t be disappointed with any of them in comparison to what you\u2019d find at a state school. Lots of state school dorms don\u2019t have AC\u2019s, windows that don\u2019t open, crumbling walls. Every dorm at Emory is climate controlled with sinks in every room at a minimum.",
