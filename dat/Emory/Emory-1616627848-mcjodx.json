  "text": "Hey! So I just got rejected from Emory but I got waitlisted at Oxford...even though I don\u2019t remember applying for that college. I don\u2019t know maybe I did and I just don\u2019t remember #senioritis Anyhoo, I did some of my own research but I wanted to know if it is actually worth it to attend the 2 yr college. What are y\u2019alls experiences? What are some of the pros and cons in your opinion?",

      "text": "\"Worth\" is a very personal thing depending upon your values, goals (if you have any decided by now), and what you can afford (and most importantly are willing to pay).  If you don't value the concept of \"elite\" education to pay the amount you/your parents are willing to, then it's a no for Oxford and would have been a no for Emory.  If that answer is a yes, then you may wanna start asking if you think you could benefit from a smaller LAC like environment, and then if so, what are your other options and how does a 2year Ox/2 year ECAS (or BBA or nursing) compare to it (does Oxford offer courses and experiences you'd be interested in?  Does Emory main? ).  No one can tell you whether something is \"worth it\" without knowing your values, what you want in a college, and how you wanna learn (or if you even view college as an oppurtunity to learn- if not, be honest with yourself.  If it is just a career stepping stone, you can do well with a smooth 4 year experience at much less selective schools.  Even if the latter schools are less challenging academically, you may benefit from standing out and having oppurtunities thrown at you by different faculty member).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally tell us what you'd like and what you don't want and be honest.  And please be careful not just view any highly ranked school(or anything affiliated with it) in USNWR as \"worth it\".  They are all actually quite different depending on what you want to study, your academic needs (are you a super competitive person that would love a sink or swim environment.  Are you the type that benefits from a collaborative environment with robust academic support services and more \"homey\" classroom environments) and your preferences for social life, etc.  If anyone answers \"I think it is worth it\", make sure that they lay out their values, what they were looking for/expected, and how the Ox experience aligned with all of that.  Realistically both Oxford and ECAS should be attracting certain \"types\" of students and not just \"I really wanna go somewhere that is well ranked because it looks good and strokes my ego\" types. Despite having student bodies that lean heavily towards going into the pre-professional pathways, they seem to better serve those who have a sense of purpose or affinity towards certain majors (that are done well) more so than those looking for \"generic elite\" experiences.  The school is more like for \"pre-professional nerds\" (as in you have a huge chunk that of course are concerned about grades, but definitely are open to learning at a high level without much complaints).  They are very academic leaning experiences but with differences in both academics and social life due to location and size.  These aren't like big sports + Greek party schools, but with smart students who care about grades.  Think of Ox as a 2 year small LAC in a rural area (as are many 4 year LACs) and ECAS as trying to be a big LAC (this weird \"Liberal arts university\" concept) in suburban/neighborhood Atlanta.",

              "text": "Trust me I believe you worked hard for your grades, but the question is whether you find it valuable to continue to do that AND to work/think hard for more than a grade.  As in, would you take more academic risks if it means you actually will be trained better than people who won't take those risks or do you view the endpoint of your work as the grade vs. the skills you gained along the way. My opinion on any \"elite\" or selective college option is that you really get the most out of it if you are open to being one of the latter people and having a growth/mixed mindset towards learning and academics (versus one where you have been told you are a special high achiever and things should always come easy to you or \"feeling challenged means something is wrong with me or the instructor\").\n\nAside from prestige driven paths like finance and pre-law where simply doing well on paper/grade wise, doing some solid ECs/internships is enough to really just take advantage of a degree from a place with above average prestige, the \"elite\" colleges are ideally about leaning into a higher level of training or achieving better thinking than you would get at places that tailor their academics to a less selected crowd.  The question becomes whether or not you are willing to or excited to engage the more challenging aspects of the school.\n\nIf you are on a track where better training is a benefit(think jobs that list very specific skills or even have \"tests\" to screen applicants), but you are scared of more rigorous instructors/courses at this type of school that help you get that so will mostly dodge, then you may as well choose a less selective school and pay less (because often the easier courses and instructors aren't too much better or more rigorous than \"regular\" schools so you are just paying more for amenities and an alumni network at that point and many large public schools have those things).\n\nFor example, an area like pre-med may be iffy.  Prestige of the undergraduate won't really benefit you beyond the host med. school (Emory), but the higher level training, if you are willing to engage it can (MCAT prep advantage. So if you can do solidly in the better STEM professor's courses/overall GPA wise, bag some great recommendation letters from a couple of them, do good ECs, shadowing, volunteering, and research if applicable, you're pretty much golden if you interview well).\n\nIf you aren't then it even becomes riskier to dodge it at an elite because the student body is so much more competitive. If you take easier (as in they water down content or give easier assessments than they should or vs. other instructors) STEM classes/pre-med core instructors, you could still get a lower final grade than what you would at a much less selective university where you could have just rode the curve to an a class pitched at the same level (basically, there would be essentially no curve in said classes at Emory because averages are so high.  You basically have to be damned near perfect to get an A in those scenarios and you are paying several times as much as the other place where you wouldn't have to be perfect and learn the material at the same level but maybe just a little slowed down).\n\nIf you were planning on just going to graduate school (MS/PhD, even MBA in this case), then perfection on paper isn't needed as much so it is easier to take risks and get the training you need to advance in those fields (more important to be prepped for the next step than just \"getting\" there as attrition in things like MS/PhDs is high) without worrying too much about GPA (because these paths are more concerned with research, experiential learning opps, and job experience than a super high GPA, and typically evaluators DO take into account the level of rigor you chose to engage when they evaluate your college GPA).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Outside of the prestige driven paths where there is obviously a benefit from just attending (social networks, alumni network, recruiting career services, etc), I would say that you could benefit from a school like Ox, ECAS and \"some\" other elites if you see yourself intentionally trying to have like 1/4-1/2 (of course you have to maintain decent grades so you don't wanna burn out) of your academic (in class and co-curricular experiences like research, fellowships, TAing, etc) experience as something that you are far less likely to have access to at either much larger or much less selective colleges and universities (especially in early years). Basically, you have to be brave enough to make your experience special/more worthwhile than if you go elsewhere or else you're paying too much money. If you feel like you'll be in permanent survival or GPA protection mode throughout all 4 years such that you can say...never take the \"hard\" teachers that get rave reviews, Emory nor Oxford (and admittedly, this one, Ox, seems very intentional in the way it challenges and teaches its 1st and 2nd year students. ECAS is the one that is so big and full of options that you have a chance at sort of squandering things) has a point unless you wanna (or can afford to) just throw money away. Some say that it is just amazing to \"learn\" from all the high achieving students and that has some truth, but reality is that instructors and mentors set the depth and pace of that learning. With people's busy schedules, it isn't like most modern day students are going to go far beyond the demands of an instructor and go in more depth. Even brilliant students need a push or some sort of inspiration.",
