      "text": "Imo I really like the food. First year you don\u2019t have a choice. You have to get it I\u2019m pretty sure. Tons of options, it\u2019s definitely good food (some days definitely better than others). I wouldn\u2019t recommend unlimited, it\u2019s definitely overkill (unless you\u2019re really a 3 square meals type of person), I found myself using maybe 2 swipes a day. Dooley dollars on the other hand are pretty useful. All the food at Cox hall and other places around campus are generally good. If you\u2019re a freshman, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re forced for unlimited though, so this may be a moot question.",

I\u2019d recommend Plan D, which gives you 180 swipes for $400 less. In a sense, for the same price you could get 180 swipes ($11.46/swipe) and $400 (added) Dooley dollars compared to 100 swipes ($18.08/swipe) and $650 Dooley dollars. \n\nClearly D is a much better deal.",

That being said, it is cheaper to just buy as many Dooley dollars as you need, which is often enough to buy enough for meals. There are many spaces that take Dooley Dollars, such as Cox dining hall, Coffee shops across campus etc. The meal swipes can be used at the dct (dining hall) and Cox hall (which might change post covid)",
