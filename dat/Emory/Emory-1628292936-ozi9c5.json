      "text": "It wouldn\u2019t hurt to review some of the topics since CHEM150 can be pretty fast-paced and the instructors don\u2019t spend too much time on one particular topic. But you\u2019ll be using ALEKS the entire semester, and will have weekly objectives to complete based off the class lectures. For example, sometime before the first exam you\u2019ll cover electron configurations, which typically is it\u2019s own objective in ALEKS.",
