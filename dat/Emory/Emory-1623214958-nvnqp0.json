Grade was based on 4 Exams and he drops the worst score so it's possible to stop attending after the 3rd exam and skip the finals if you do well on the first 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFritz is a dry but fair lecturer. It's not going to be amazing like Weinschenk or Eisen.",

                  "text": "Unless it changed, I am pretty sure it's a solid mix.   Most upper divisions aren't pure (or even mostly) MCQ. Exceptions include 336, 301 and maybe Otoole's 240(maybe she changed but she strikes me as a lazy test writer).  But the classes most helpful to pre-meds aren't MCQ (plus hopefully you can do better on more than MCQs.  Like the MCAT is an MCQ test but one where the MCQs are designed more like a short answer where they say students should be able to guess an answer without looking at the choices so if your comfort zone is like that HS and biol 14x level MCQ, try to get comfy with more FRQ and short answer based exams in bio sooner than later. It'll really help you).",

It's been a while (Fall of 2012!) so I'm not entirely surprised that he changed the syllabus.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs the exam still written/partial multiple choice?

For example I can't completely remember if it was mostly like recall and detail based or if they had some problem solving/experimental developmental type of items.  Then it may have changed.\n\n I just remember Fritz and his tests being dry (I think it was lots of recall and writing out specifics and sometimes drawing out what a body plan may look like if a certain gene was knocked down.  You pretty much needed to know the book and slides in and out. I knew for a fact there were likely better ways to run or assess in that type of class because I've seen versions at some other peers)",

I guess people can go for 241. Content simple, teaching quality doesn't matter. It's a nice soft introduction to more problem solving and experimentally focused bios.  Other than it, 360, 247, 250, and 264, and the 2 385s it seems the \"just know, memorize, and regurgitate it\"(including 370 because Campbell is teaching it) suite of bio courses are dominant this fall.",
