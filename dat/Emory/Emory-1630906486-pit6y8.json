      "text": "Are you a first year?  If so, are you sure you \"can't handle\" the course? Because unless the course is very advanced vs. your year, I feel you'd have little evidence for that at this point (and no, screwing up on an early assessment shouldn't be enough evidence.  You could say: \"Oh I am missing x,y, and/or z or didn't study well, so I need to get serious ASAP\" and do fine on everything else) and I think first years get a later withdrawal without penalty deadline so you can do a few assessments (like quizzes, a test, graded HW if offered) and see how you do and then make the determination.  Like I think this \"can't handle\" thing is maybe more likely for upper classmen who run into an advanced core or elective that caught them by surprise (as in they have enough experience to determine whether they are well-equipped to do okay, even if not an A, early on).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou get to take advantage of the extended withdrawal deadline if a first year:  [http://college.emory.edu/oue/academic-calendar.html](http://college.emory.edu/oue/academic-calendar.html)\n\nLike unless it is ridiculously overwhelming (and not: \"Oh shoot, getting an A/A- won't be easy}) already maybe consider seeing what happens after another couple of weeks unless the rest of your schedule is super intensive.",
