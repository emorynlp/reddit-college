  "text": "Cost is a factor but I want to forget about it for a minute. I\u2019m currently committed to Rutgers University and it is VERY large (35k undergrads). As you know, Oxford is a LOT smaller than this. I\u2019m not sure if I want a small size or not, but my main concern is not having enough to do. I enjoy being busy. I love the city. Im afraid Covington isn\u2019t going to have much for me to explore. But I really want to go, because I know the academic quality is amazing, and I really want to take some leadership positions of clubs during my sophomore year. There are a ton of things I like about it, but my main concern is the isolation. \n\nDo you guys have any comments on the scene at Oxford? Is my apprehension well-founded or is it really a great experience?\n\nEDIT: Also, is there any good vegan food?",

      "text": "Oxford/Covington doesn't really do vegan. If there is, it's purely by accident, imo. Mostly fast food chains. A couple local owned places, but they are not too exciting. A hot night on the town for locals often involves Longhorn. (said as a local who has been here a while)\n\nThere's not much to explore for Oxford/Covington that can't be done in one or two day trips. I mean, we couldn't even keep a bowling alley (closed late 90s if memory serves), movie theater (closed mid-2000s), or a skating rink (closed mid-2000s) in business. Some folks like to visit to tour the filming hotspots if they are into Vampire Diaries (or In the Heat of the Night, Dukes of Hazard, etc), but meh....\n\nDon't get me completely wrong. I did my 2 years on Oxford's campus and 2 years at Emory. I enjoyed it. But I was used to the idea of Oxford. Taking an hour to get to anything interesting (Atlanta, Athens, etc) was something I was used to. \"Exploring a city\" wasn't exactly in my vocabulary at that point. (Hell, it still isn't 15 years later.)\n\nIf Rutgers doesn't have as strong an International Studies program, I like to think you'd make up with it by being near New York for external experiences and opportunities.",

Yes, there are lots of clubs and events on campus (during the week -- it's a ghost town during the weekend when the Great Atlanta Migration happens), but it's a hassle to get to Atlanta and there's almost nothing to do in Covington.",

      "text": "In my opinion, Oxford isn\u2019t worth the guaranteed continuation to Emory. It\u2019s very isolated, and there\u2019s not much to do on campus except study. Covington is also impossible to explore unless you have a car (or friends who can drive), and it\u2019s mostly filled with non-vegan fast food chains, which sounds like something you wouldn\u2019t be interested in. Lil\u2019s has a vegan section, but it\u2019s not very big. \n\nThe academics at Oxford, however, are high quality. The international studies major in particular is solid. It\u2019s nothing revolutionary, but the political science professors at Oxford are very knowledgable about their field of study. You also have the advantage of taking small classes with them and potentially getting to know them really well. \n\nIn short, the academics at Oxford are great, whereas every other aspect of the school sucks. Whether or not you should attend Oxford depends on what your priorities are. Do you want to belong in an academically rigorous environment and graduate from Emory? Or do you want a more traditional college experience and take advantage of the recreational/professional opportunities available in the city?\n\nPersonally, if I were you...I would go to Rutgers. It sounds like you want to live in the city, and Oxford is rural more than anything else. I can\u2019t really blame you, since I also love exploring the city and find myself trapped at Oxford, despite appreciating the academic opportunities that it has to offer. Emory\u2019s Druid Hills campus, however, seems like a perfect fit for you. If I were you, I would excel academically at Rutgers for one year and then try transferring to Emory. Best of luck in making a decision, and congratulations on your acceptances.",

              "text": "Honestly, I would prioritize fit and being able to visualize yourself thriving at a school above everything else. I didn't mention this in my first post, but I strongly believe in attending an institution that makes you happy, regardless of whether or not it's deemed as a prestigious school. You've worked tremendously hard in high school, and now it's time for you to attend a school that you're content at. Doing anything else will damage your mental health.\n\nSince you strongly dislike Rutgers, I wouldn't settle with it. While I still believe that Oxford isn't perfect, it sounds like the idea of attending Rutgers brings you tremendous discomfort that will only persist as you remained enrolled there. Despite being in the middle of nowhere, Oxford also has several pros that you mentioned in your post. Even if you don't end up liking Oxford (or if it ends up being unaffordable), you can always leave. I would just avoid going somewhere that you already know you will be unhappy at, since it'll not only be a waste of your time and money but also impact your mental stability.",
