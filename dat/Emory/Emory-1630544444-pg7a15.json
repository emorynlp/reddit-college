              "text": "Those two were ultimately collaborators at one point but the primary difference that explains why Darwin is so famous is because he already had a fairly deep description of one of the mechanisms driving evolution (whereas Wallace did not get that far until it was about time for Darwin to publish his finding and of course the evidence contributing to his epiphany was not not as well fleshed out as Darwin's) in natural selection. I'll leave it to you to look up the observations they both made (mainly in different parts of the world).  They did publish some letters together.  View them as puzzle pieces and maybe just look up their independent observations (and where they made them) prior to their collaboration.  You are not limited to lecture slides and your little Freeman book for assignments.  Be curious my friend! That's how you become a real scientist (or even a stronger than average pre-med)! It's Emory, be ready to go above and beyond (like get access to a couple of their letters or publications and see how they described stuff. That is excellent primary evidence) what is right in front of you to learn or figure out whatever you need to.\n\n*Don't ask why I know this stuff as a biochemist. It's what happens when you decide to be a grad TA for a freshman evolutionary biology course at a very large university.",
