  "title:": "PSA: You can take an Emory Law course that is cross-listed with REL 370.",
  "text": "For those interested in fulfilling an HSC requirement, there are three courses that are cross-listed between religion and law as REL 370.\n\n* LAW 601A: (First Amendment: Free Expression)\n* LAW 601B (First Amendment: Religious Freedom)\n* LAW 626 (Federal Indian Law)\n\nLAW 601B does not have any prerequisites, but LAW 601A and LAW 626 would benefit from some knowledge of Constitutional Law. However, you can still request permission to join! Just check out the Atlas. Only 1 undergrad has taken these slots.\n\nP.S. Law school schedules are different from ECAS so it might overlap with two classes.",
