I\u2019d seen some other colleges where everyone looked lifeless, but at Emory most of the students looked like they were enjoying themselves. Everyone else in the tour group got the same vibe if that\u2019s worth anything.",

      "text": "For having such a small veteran's population, they're pretty good at accommodating veterans. Most veterans don't apply to private schools, which have a slightly more complicated GI Bill tuition system compared to public schools. The school certifying official still verifies everything on time and makes sure we understand what each step of the process is so we can get paid on time. Emory also has very generous aid for us because we usually come out of our contracts unemployed. All this info would've been a big factor in choosing to attend Emory, but I did not know all this before committing. Ended up being a big surprise.",

      "text": "Kind of a bit late but I\u2019ll comment.\n\nPros\n\n- Generally really collaborative & not cutthroat, even in science intro classes. \n- Many resources + research for MOST departments. - Most professors are awesome too and want to see you succeed.\n- Lots of help if you\u2019re struggling in classes \n- People are nice\n- Weather is great \n- Campus is small but really beautiful, especially inside buildings.\n- Many opportunities to do whatever you want for most interests, ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re premed.\n- We\u2019re in a safe suburban neighborhood and Atlanta is like 15 minutes away by shuttle.\n\nCons (some of them aren\u2019t depending on what kind of person you are)\n\n- Biggest one is lack of school spirit. No one cares about our sports teams and I could be wrong (maybe cause my first year was during COVID) but I feel like not a ton of people seemed proud to be here.\n- Certain departments are lacking \u2014 think astrophysics & engineering.\n- Greek/party scene is also lacking if that\u2019s your thing. It exists but its a far cry from schools like Vandy and Duke. If you\u2019re open to making friends at GTech it\u2019s probably better there and you can go to their parties.\n- Pre-professional oriented imo. Most resources are for people that are pre-biz/law/med or for nursing students and those are most of the people that go here. I think A LOT of freshmen start out as premed too (maybe 35-40%?).\n- Gender ratio is imbalanced. Around 58-60% girls, mainly because we don\u2019t have a solid engineering department. Most universities nowadays have 53-55% though because more girls are going to college than guys, so not a huge difference honestly, but you can definitely feel it at times.",
