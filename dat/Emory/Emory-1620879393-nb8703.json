      "text": "maybe avoid 336 altogether lol (but seriously).  Also don't worry about the \"topics\" because they can be covered very differently. For example, both are likely to cover signaling cascades and GTPases.  336 will ask you to just memorize those pathways and their relevance to some physiological response.  250 will probably connect it to experimental data/get you to see what evidence of these signaling cascades (and what they do for the cell. Like we know certain GTPases drive cell and organelle fusion events) looks like (notice how the description for cell mentions primary literature). Again, expect two different approaches and contexts for the overlapping topics. When or if you take each is up to you.",
