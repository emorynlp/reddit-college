Last semester, we brought over 800 students together for over 18 hours of competitive gameplay and more than $5,000 in prizes. The event is put on by Georgia Tech eSports, a student organization under the Georgia Tech College of Computing.\n\nGamefest Fall 2014 will be held on the weekend of **October 25 & 26**.  As usual, Gamefest will span the Klaus Advanced Computing Building and the Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons.\n\n**https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fkvtr53c1SNSzR8838Z65ad8GY-cgQ_pRKWlpaBcRjs/viewform**\n\n\nTell us what you are interested in playing by taking this preliminary survey!",
