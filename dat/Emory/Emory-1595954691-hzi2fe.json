  "text": "Greetings everyone!  Online student parking registration opened yesterday.  Here is the link for information:   [https://transportation.emory.edu/student-parking](https://transportation.emory.edu/student-parking) \n\nWe are working to make it safer and easier for all those living and commuting to campus.   The new parking setup is designed in a way that supports increased walkability and decreases the shuttle demand for shorter trips whenever possible. Your flexibility with these changes will allow for resources to be allocated to non-walkable routes and to effectively support physical distancing. \n\nAll student permits will grant access to the Peavine, Michael Street, Starvine, Woodruff Lot, URC, and CRC Parking Decks. First year law students will be assigned to the Gambrell Parking Deck.\n\nBe well and stay safe!",

                  "text": "Deck-by-deck.  Parking industry standards points to 85% of total capacity as the target for daily volume of any parking lot or deck.  Pre-covid, we were seeing 85-92% average per semester.\n\nEDIT:  The idea is to get everyone close to their on-campus destination.  Since we've never seen class schedules like this we have to assume people who were normally parking at Starvine/CRC/URC (3,000+ spaces) will want to park closer.  We can spread that volume over the decks on main campus since in-person classes are significantly lower.\nThat is why we think the volume for the main campus decks will be the same as pre-covid.",
