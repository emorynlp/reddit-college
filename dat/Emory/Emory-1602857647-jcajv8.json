  "title:": "Is off-campus housing a viable option for online freshman spring 2021?",
  "text": "Hi. Basically, a group of students and I prefer the online format and would like to rent an apartment on a short term lease for just spring 2021. We still wanted a good social life with college friends, so instead of paying ~15k per person for room and board over a semester, we\u2019d be paying around 8k per person for the Apartment, groceries, and other expenses over a semester. I was just wondering if this would affect financial aid disbursements, if a \u201ccommuter status\u201d is possible (maybe not because of COVID tests?) and if we would still be allowed to enter campus?",

If you get aid that covers housing, you\u2019ll just get a massive refund to your bank account (the money that would normally be used for housing) and you\u2019re just responsible for covering your own housing expenses (which in this semester some people may not have any so they get to keep the money).\nThe only exception to paying would be if you\u2019re living on campus rn and want to get out of the housing contract for the next semester, which I have heard could be a massive pain, then they could actually force you to pay for living on campus as they\u2019re basically counting on you already to be there. There are some exceptions to get out though, and I\u2019m not sure if due to covid they have added any newer ones",
