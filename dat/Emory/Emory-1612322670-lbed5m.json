      "text": "It depends what you'll be doing but in general I'd say no; there's a robust shuttle system on campus, and multiple MARTA bus stops that will bring you directly to little five points, virginia highland, downtown decatur, etc; and for the occasional times where you do need a car it's far easier to take easier an taxi or renting a car (I think there's some ZipCars on campus though don't quote me on that).\n\nAll the Emory and MARTA buses also have bike racks in front of them so you can put a bicycle with you and then bike the last mile to your destination if it's not right by a stop.",

Bus route 6 will bring you to Little 5 points and the Inman Park train station\n\nBus route 36 will bring you through piedmont park/beltline and to the Midtown train station.

      "text": "I\u2019d also agree it\u2019s not necessary. However, it makes a HUGE difference to have one and allows for more freedom to explore ATL outside of Emory. It also really helps in saving Uber money and the added freedom of being able to go wherever you want whenever you want. The food options around campus are just way too limited and in the long run you\u2019d spend just a lot more money ordering services like Ubereats",
