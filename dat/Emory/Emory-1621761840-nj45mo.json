  "text": "I kinda find it messed up that the return date for textbooks this year is in May even though most students are off campus, and we had til August last year, but whatever. I was planning on returning my textbooks later this week and had even called the bookstore to make sure they would accept them, and then today they charged me processing and return fees totaling $300 for all of my textbooks. I don\u2019t really have the money to pay for that so I emailed them, but I don\u2019t really expect them to accept them even though they\u2019re in fine condition and I could return them by the end of this week. Does anyone have any advice on what to do if I missed the textbook return date? Any insight on where I could sell my textbooks and still get money perhaps? $300 is a lot to pay for books I don\u2019t want :/",
