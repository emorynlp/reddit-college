This semester most classes are online, in my experience classes have been good and professors are generally handling the change well. There are weekend activities (concerts, job fairs, club meetings etc happening online over zoom which has been nice.) Oxford is a smaller campus which can be nice to be in a smaller community during this time, but I would make the decision based on your major (feel free to message me for more details). I have heard making friends is difficult and people are lonely (everywhere, not just at Emory) but if you join some clubs/ get involved/ make an effort to reach out you should be ok. I personally believe things should be a lot better by next Fall, though maybe not completely back to \u201cnormal\u201d.",
