  "title:": "Welcome to the Fall Semester! Want to compete with fellow college students in Minecraft? Come represent your school on The Quad! A Minecraft Server for College Students! (mc.thequad.dev)",
  "text": "Hello! We are The Quad. We are a UNIVERSAL Minecraft Server mainly built for college students!\n\nOur server features an email verification system allowing you to verify which school you attend to get a custom prefix.\n\nThis will allow for rivalries and school pride! Our server is Survival with minigames. The current minigames that we have are Soccer (for college teams), Hunger Games, and MobArena. We plan to add more minigames and features upon request on our [Discord](http://discord.com/invite/tZdPWQQ)!\n\n**Here is our server IP: mc.thequad.dev** it is Java Edition. We hope to see you on there!\n\nAlso, you don't have to be in College to play. The prefix system is just for those currently enrolled/graduated.\n\n**If any issues occur, send a message to the mods or post on our subreddit or Discord. We'll fix it ASAP. Sometimes the email system goes down but your code still exists, it just has to be sent**",
