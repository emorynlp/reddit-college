Im trying to decide what classes to take for the spring semester and Im already planning to take two of my nursing requirements, Spanish and ox studies but that leads me to 11 credits. If you want to graduate on time you should shoot for 16 credits a semester, so does anyone know any filler classes I can take ?",

He notes that for nurses, you'll be able to learn diseases from a perspective they don't teach in nursing school.\n\nEDIT: Whoops just saw you're Oxford. Highly recommend ANTH_OX 101 or ANTH_OX 201Q then.",
