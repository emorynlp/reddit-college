  "text": "I've noticed a number of students coughing (probably not COVID, just a cold or the flu). \n\nI also have a sore throat but repeatedly tested negative for COVID. I feel like utter dogshit though: terribly tired and I'm having trouble speaking loudly. \n\nAny tips for dealing with this? I would really rather not come to some classes even with the mask on, if possible, and unfortunately, I'm in a number of discussion-centered classes.",

      "text": "Ah, the dreaded frat flu. \n\nI would reccomend emergen-c (vitamin c powder you add to water) as well as chugging water like nobody's business. Blow your nose as often as you can, and get TONS of sleep for a few nights in a row and you'll be over it in no time. Hot tea (u can get it in dct they've got some good flavors, don't waste money on Kaldis) is great if you feel a cough coming on during class.",
