      "text": "Spanish 201 is relatively easy. If you've taken AP Spanish you should be good. It's just a review of common verb tenses: Preterite, Imperfect, Future, and its derivatives. Vocabulary as well, but that just comes down to rote memorization, and you're never given too many words at once. Good luck!",
