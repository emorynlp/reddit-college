The tests are meant to be pretty good at matching students to the level they'll learn the best and get the most out of.  I'm sure even at Emory, new languages do not come \"naturally\" to most or many people. Most language instructors are quite fair and run classes at an accessible pace and caliber that matches your experience/ability.  \n\nAgain, just take the placement test and see what happens. You are allowed to go and get a taste for the class you place into and then decide whether or not to negotiate down. I doubt there is a need to just avoid the correct level altogether based on some perceived natural or lack of natural ability. I really wouldn't fear this requirement and your placement this much.  It will be okay if you feel out where you actually place and figure things out from there.",

I'm not denying that it exists for some things but I wouldn't let a lack of it stop you from trying things outside of your comfort zone, accelerating if you are experienced at something, or taking something you know might challenge you every now and again. Everything isn't supposed to feel easy or natural. If it does at a place like Emory you may not be learning as much as you are supposed to or at rye right level.",
