  "text": "Hey friends. I'm starting my PhD program at Emory in the Fall and I'm super excited! I might be a little overeager here, but Ultimate Frisbee is a huge part of my life and I know Emory has a pretty good team. I've been looking everywhere for some contact information about how to join a frisbee team in the area and have had no luck. I was wondering if anyone on here might be able to direct me to someone in charge of women's ultimate.  Or even just to someone who might know someone who might know someone who knows a frisbee player. Haha I will work with what I can get.  Thanks <3",

      "text": "I'm coming to Emory in August for Law school! I used to play Ultimate in high school and early on in college. I probably suck now, but would also be interested in playing some ultimate games sometime! I've needed a new cardio hobby besides leisure runs. Used to do swim club competitively, but after some ear surgeries I'm afraid to practice (even with a cap) :(",
