      "text": "That would probably be too much and wouldn't really benefit you. If you want IB in the future and want a second major, I'd just drop econ and just do math. The BA in math only requires 36 credits including math 111 which you could skip with AP credit. Math/Econ is 51 credits which would be roughly 5 additional classes. CompSci could arguably be more useful than math for IB and the BA in that is also just 36 credits.\n\nRemember, you're going to have gen eds you need to complete and you'll only be able to enter the business school after at least 3, maybe 4, semesters. Because math is a discipline that builds on itself, you can't just load up your first 3 or 4 semesters with math/econ classes to get the dual major out of the way before you enter the business school. That's possible for a major like English which doesn't have tons of prereqs as you move higher in the major but not with math. This means that if you did the dual degree, your junior and senior year would be absolutely jam packed with math, Econ, and business classes.\n\nIs it possible to do finance+math/econ? Yes. Would it benefit you beyond just finance+math? No. Would you enjoy your time at Emory if you took on finance+math/econ? No.",

              "text": "That's a vague question.  Don't know qualities would make you consider a math dept good (it is easier to evaluate this in other STEM disciplines tbh).  All I advise is that you choose professors wisely.  You can flippantly choose sections of intermediate and upper division courses and possibly beat up your GPA and still not know squat or be able to problem solve if your life depended on it or you can choose better instructors who really teach, do the best you can, likely perform better, and be well-positioned to do well at an internship or competitions of some sort.  In addition, the teachers that actually like teaching undergraduates are more likely to look out for you and keep you up to speed on some competitions or opps for enrichment (may even recruit you to them). You'd want that.  It truly is as good as you make it.  If you ever are interested in math research or more open ended problems, look into Garicia's courses and really anyone in the abstract algebra/number theory realms.  That area has been known to take in and produce excellent math students (there were 2 Goldwaters back to back years that had connections to that cluster and one got set up with Budapest semesters oppurtunity.  They both basically were coronated by faculty in those areas). \n\n If you can do solidly(be humble...you don't have to do perfect in something like math) and show that you are into more than just making As, they have lots of faculty that will take care of you.  Like other schools, math teaching will be hit or miss, but the best teachers in the dept are well known so find out who they are and take (even if they are known to be challenging-and by challenging I mean requires you to do more than just redo HW or quiz problems/problem types on a test or maybe asks you to understand math conceptually or do significant proof writing beyond just regurgitating definitions.  Basically instructors that reward more than just obedience. These instructors may upset you at first, but they are doing you a favor. An employer will not always hold your hand through a nuanced or grey area situation you've never been shown before. And if you ever consider graduate school, you'd definitely wanna become more flexible in your thinking and ability to problem solve because God knows graduate school research and problems are very open ended and take a bit of creativity) when you can.",

                      "text": "Oh random thing that may get you to obsess less over GPA:  Emory does NOT give Latin Honors based on GPA (back to that undergraduate focus again).  Instead what happens is the College and the departments in the College set a floor for a GPA needed to pursue an honors thesis which is usually 3.5 in disciplines with less grade inflation.  Please do this if you can to keep options other than IB open.  This ensures you have a solid GPA, but also gets you to immerse yourself in a discipline/supervised project which is something many employers and graduate programs (especially top tier graduate programs, which of course are research based) will love to see.  Seeing that you are willing to immerse yourself in whatever and churn out a deliverable (a research paper, publication, whatever) not for a grade will certainly help you look good and just develop you personally and intellectually.  I think it is definitely one of the things Emory gets right.  Schools who give it based on GPA have lots of stupid stuff going on.  Like, it incentivizes people to choose easier majors and instructors that don't necessarily push students to learn much, but they get rewarded for sort of gaming the system (which becomes easier as elite privates grade inflate more).  \n\nEven Harvard has essentially stopped doing it and requires most students to get departmental honors (like Emory- this typically requires a thesis, and departments that don't require a thesis there will not allow a student to be awarded Magna or Summa Cum Laude to those who don't do the thesis...so impressively Emory was ahead of the game when it came to this.  Don't think Emory ever did GPA based honors though) before qualifying for any Latin honors.  Take advantage of that if you are in a position to do so and put it in the \"experience\" column on your resume and maybe talk about it, if relevant, during interviews.\n\n*If you go to econ's. website, you'll also note that all/most of the non-teaching support based senior/graduate awards went to students that did honors theses,  so even the department known for producing students that chase those high paid fields that supposedly want/need a high GPA was not just going out of its way to reward people for merely getting a high GPA.  They wanted evidence of scholarly engagement and not that someone could just sort of perform in coursework.  So don't view your education as just jumping through hoops to get to the IB or w/e lol.  Try to immerse yourself in something in and outside of the academic spheres and have something to show for that immersion.",

He took mostly math courses for his first 2 semesters and just hated the professors and the department (even tho he loved math).\n\nIf you like it then by all means don\u2019t let this dissuade you, but maybe consider looking into the BBA+QSS major if you\u2019re interested in Math and the B-School. QSS has become a really strong department at Emory in recent years and you still end up taking a lot of the math courses (linear algebra, BC, Multivariable, etc.) but it\u2019s more focused on data science when you get to the higher level courses in the major. If that\u2019s interesting at all to you I\u2019d recommend looking into it.",

Pre-emptively claiming a major you haven't completed is not gonna impress the employers/companies that are offering the internship opp.  They'll wanna see what you've actually completed and prepared for at the date of application.  You can't trick/signal to them with what are ultimately \"pre-labels\" or expressions of intent to major in something.  If you can do well in more quantitative courses (whether you major or not) than what were taken by other applicants with high GPAs, then of course you get bonus points, but the major itself (and hell, a person can just choose the path of least resistance through a major and do the minimum and they'll be able to tell), unless the companies say they require that specific degree for the position (unlikely) matters much less.",

Had a friend who was finance+ math because her dad wanted her to do math. She hated it and quit math junior year. And she was fine. She got a job at HSBC in IB.",

I list the courses taken on my resume so employers know this. When you use the Goizueta resume template, you will most likely do the same. \n\nI\u2019d say choose whichever one will give you the highest GPA. In this case, I\u2019d recommend BBA + Econ as math might take away precious time from networking and learning technicals. Econ provides some valuable skills such as showing that you are somewhat comfortable with numbers and can code as the statistics for economists and econometrics classes have a coding component. However, if you decide to make a switch to something like prop trading, then definitely do math.",
