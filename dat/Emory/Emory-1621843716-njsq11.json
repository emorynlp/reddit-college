  "text": "I'm an upcoming sophomore and I would like to take soc 101 but I'm wondering if the class is prioritized for the freshmen because I remember some people saying some classes are closed for freshmen. Also what do you guys recommend to take after soc 101 for pre med students who have to complete 2 set of behavioral science classes? Thanks!",
