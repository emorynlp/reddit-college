Some of my AP scores won\u2019t be coming back until the end of august. Would I still be able to fulfill GERs using the AP scores I\u2019ve reported late? \n\nThank you.",

You can still report AP scores and choose which ones transfer to your record by the end of first semester. So if you only want to fulfill GERs, you should be alright. Still talk to your academic counselor though.\n\nSource: apply.emory.edu/apply/first-year/tips/credits.html",
