  "title:": "admission rescinded for bad ib scores",
  "text": "i was accepted rd and committed to emory for the fall 2021 semester. \ni listed on my application that i was an ib diploma candidate but did not list my predicted scores and don\u2019t think that my school shared them either.\ni have been sitting for ib tests and feel less and less confident about my scores. i think i may just barely get the diploma and will definitely receive a 2 or 3 on one hl and one sl class. \nhow likely is it that my admission to emory is rescinded if i don\u2019t receive the diploma or do receive the diploma but get 2 extremely low scores. i expect that my actual high school transcript will have all As if that makes any difference.\ni\u2019m just super concerned but do not have a lot of motivation being a senior and knowing that only one of these tests will get me credit at emory.\nthanks for any help you can give :)",

Y'all need to chill with some of this stuff. The admissions office and administrators who take care of AP/IB credits probably won't even see those until mid or late summer when you start crafting a schedule.",
