  "text": "If I love going to football and basketball games, will I be really disappointed at Emory? \n\nI\u2019m planning to play club tennis, but I come from a huge football HS and I love school spirit/tailgating/watching and going to games with friends/etc. \n\nTbh I\u2019m more attracted to the big 10 school vibe (umich) but I got the best Financial Aid from Emory \n\nDo people go to the basketball games at Emory? Or any sports? How common is it? Do students go to Georgia Tech for football?  Are there some students who prefer a more athletic/spirited atmosphere?",

      "text": "I was in the same boat as you: I love football, and I wanted a school with lots of spirit. Ended up choosing Emory over a D1 school in a Power 5 conference. Looking through your post history, I can see that your parents pushed you to pick Emory. That\u2019s exactly what happened to me. \n\nUltimately, I fell into the \u201cyou can always go to a GT/UGA game\u201d trap. Yes, you can attend those games. But trust me when I tell you: it is not the same. You will feel like an outsider at those games. \n\nI\u2019ll say this; come into Emory with an open mind. You\u2019ll find others just like you who love sports and crave school spirit. Despite not having a school team, you\u2019ll still have a blast hanging with your new friends and watching games with them, I promise you. \n\nIf you still crave school spirit, you can look into the possibility of transferring after your first year. Emory is known as one of the best schools to transfer out of primarily because it is an academically prestigious school, and it is not particularly hard to maintain a good GPA here (depends on what you\u2019re studying, of course). Best of luck to you!",

          "text": "I'd rather just discourage them from coming. Having folks come in with their mind already on potentially transfer doesn't help Emory at all lol.  But it doesn't hurt chances if transferring from elite privates or publics. As you say, all are pretty doable in terms of keeping a high GPA unless you are a physical sciences or engineering major I guess. I do worry that for those with intent to possibly transfer, it colors their academic decisions. As in they just choose the easiest(even if it ain't good quality) stuff that would absolutely guarantee a high GPA vs. choosing some of the best stuff that they may make them enjoy Emory a little more.  \n\nBasically the student self-sabotages themselves into wanting to transfer even more (then they make sure to trash Emory on the way out even though they didn't try to make it worh something).  I've seen that happen more than I should've.  Again, I never understand those who need less or no fin. aid sort of flippantly choosing it for prestige even when it isn't a fit at all.  \n\n\nAnd speak for yourself on \"you feel like an outsider\".  Blessed are those who are from Georgia! lol. Although I honestly prefer UGA as a team and being in Athens for the festivities and atmosphere.  Good times! Ask those 4 Ox kids.",

I'm just saying there were lots of like full pay or basically full pay folks who had other choices (even if less prestigious) that may have even given them scholarships who complained.  Usually other contenders that lots of the spirit oriented students got into or considered was Tulane which I think is a very good option. \n\n I always thought Emory should just be getting the more academic leaning people who can stand not having that type of spirit (and have weirdly, seen folks transfer from places like Tulane looking for just that), but it doesn't market itself like that.  It does this faux \"we're work hard play hard but without the sports\".  I don't really agree that such marketing matches what it really is.",

They\u2019re mostly through open parties at frats, but some are through bars/clubs, which means coming to campus with a fake ID is extremely helpful\u2014most freshmen have one (totally up to you if you want to get one though). \n\nWhether or not you join a frat come second semester freshman year, the opportunities to party are still there.",

I just don't understand why, outside of those backed into limited choices based on financial aid, they still went or why they don't come up with other traditions that aren't sports centered (beyond the few Emory has already).  There are things you can enjoy at Tech, UGA, and prof. sports like the United which are really fun, but I'm gonna keep it real and just say Emory isn't about the \"American pie\"/college film like social scene and spirit.
