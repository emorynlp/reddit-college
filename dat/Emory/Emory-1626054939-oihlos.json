Someone else also DMd me saying they thought I literally said \u201cdon\u2019t go to oxford (like just don\u2019t attend because it might be bad or something)\u201d instead of \u201cI go to main instead so don\u2019t know all the info at ox\u201d. I meant the latter with my first sentence but could\u2019ve been clearer ig.\n\nWas just trying to help though :(",

A lot of these questions are very specific to the campus and would be part of some broader communication via administrators or an orientation website that they need to look up somewhere other than reddit. Hard for us to answer. As for me I know I'm blunt but I just go with what the data and my experience tells me.",
