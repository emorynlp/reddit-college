  "text": "I really want to get involved with research next semester (psych major, rising junior) but I really don\u2019t know how. I have no past research experience. I\u2019m a transfer student so I don\u2019t know anyone yet. I think I qualify for the SIRE program but I\u2019m not sure how to ask a professor to mentor me when they don\u2019t know me and I don\u2019t fully understand how any of this works. \n\nAre there places outside of Emory I can do a research internship for?\n\nIf anyone has any advice, suggestions, or stories about what worked for you, I\u2019d really appreciate it.",

      "text": "I'm sure others will weigh in with more info but the first step to getting a research position for the school year is to email a professor introducing yourself and asking if they'd have time to talk with you about their research because you are interested in pursuing research yourself. Note that is different than asking them to talk to you about how you can get involved in their research which may be too much to ask a stranger. Instead find out generalities and ask for their advice during your convo and at the end ask if they might have any open positions in their lab or if they could point you to someone else in the department who might.",

      "text": "Here\u2019s my advice:\n-\tcast a wide net. Email a bunch of people.\n-\tdo your research before emailing. Know what they work on. Know it at a more-than-superficial level (eg \u201cI\u2019m really interested in the work you published on [description not literally copied from title or abstract of paper]\u201d\n-\trecognize that many emails will go unanswered \n-\tdon\u2019t tell professors you are pre-med and want research experience to get into medical school (even if that\u2019s true).\n-\tdon\u2019t expect to be paid. There are opportunities to get paid for research. But don\u2019t come off as having this as an expectation right off the bat.\n-\tknow what skills you need for research and highlight them if you have them. Coding, for example is always in demand.\n-\tknow what skills you are trying to develop (\u201cresearch skills\u201d not specific enough) and talk about those.\n-\tbefore you meet with a professor, do your homework on their research. Read papers; even if they don\u2019t make complete sense. Come prepared with questions.",

      "text": "Also if you\u2019re a transfer and taking science electives definitely go into office hours, make small talk, ask about their research and their peers research. It can lead to an opening. If you know what major you want, declare it as soon as possible because it puts you on the department listserv where they often post open lab  positions for undergrads (which is honestly the easiest way to find them). As you make friends in your sconce classes you can also ask them if they know of labs looking to hire. The research community at Emory is massive but unfortunately had to break in. I feel like after you join a lab you start learning about tons of opportunities in other labs that you wouldn\u2019t have heard of which is king of ironic.",

Chem, you gotta just approach them (usually well before you ever take a course with them because there are too many cores).
