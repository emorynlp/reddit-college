  "text": "I just got my placement test results and got put into 201. I'm probably not going to take french this year, but if my other classes fill up before I enroll and this class is still open, I'll probably take it this semester. The professors this semester are Vincent Bornert, Elinore Darzi and Julien Dahan. I can't find much on rate my professor for them. Any recommendations on which professor would be ideal (even for if they teach again next year)?\n\nThanks!",
