  "text": "Hi y'all! I'm moving to Atlanta soon and I was wondering about how far in advance to sign a lease at places near Emory. I'm looking to move in late July or early August. Right now it seems there are tons of move in options in June, but not a ton for July. Do I just need to wait a bit longer for more July options to come available, or are places completely filling up?\n\nI'm totally new to the area so any advice is appreciated, and thanks in advance!",

      "text": "Heya, I\u2019m an out of state student moving to Atlanta this summer too. I just recently signed a lease to move in early August and my advice to you is to do it ASAP. I signed a lease over at Briarcliff Campus Crossing and they were pretty much 100% booked up already when I signed up near the end of last month. A couple of other places I contacted near the school were filling up pretty fast, so I\u2019d really suggest looking into it now. That\u2019s just my experience with the move though, best of luck!",
