All I can gather from the website is that the application opens in a week.\n\n^(also at the risk of sounding desperate please feel free to DM me if you're quiet and looking for an unobtrusive roommate to fill a vacancy before someone random gets pulled in)",

You can even put a specific room number or a person\u2019s name (can\u2019t remember which) if memory serves, so if you know someone who has a vacant room then that might be your best bet if you don\u2019t want to be matched with a weird person.\nObviously they try to match your interest to other people\u2019s, but since you won\u2019t know what rooms will be available there is a random chance that you can be moved to an apartment with a stranger. Hope this makes sense!",
