  "text": "hi everyone! sorry for the floods of co25 admits that have fueled this sub with prestige-whore snobness. i basically came on here because i\u2019m facing a really tough decision! i\u2019m going back and forth between my local state school and emory. at emory, id have to pay about 20k more a year, and i don\u2019t know how id handle that? as students, are there ways to get more scholarships? is work study doable at a school where academics are pressing? (if it helps, im a polisci/english major) is it worth it to go to emory despite the cost? i visited a while ago but it was during COVID so i didn\u2019t get a great vibe of the campus. if you could sum it up in a few words, what would you say?",

      "text": "20k is pretty significant and that will add up to be a significant sum in 4 years. I'm not on campus right now because of COVID so I can't really give you a good idea of the vibe but before this year I thought Emory had some pretty nice community and it was definitely pretty easy to meet people. But your college experience, like many will tell you, is a pretty personal thing that can only be decided by what you want to make of it.\n\nI encourage you to think more about it but I don't really think any college campus is worth an additional 20k more. Save yo money yo.\n\nOH but I can tell you that campus is absolutely drop dead gorgeous. I am not a morning person, in fact I always wake up pretty annoyed and grumpy. But walking to my early morning classes with the sun rising in front of me and over the student center always left me with a smile on my face.",

It\u2019s been rigorous but the class selection is awesome and I\u2019ve really enjoyed all of my professors. \n\nThat said, I transferred to Emory from a community college and I enjoyed my experience there too. 20k is a lot of money, and I\u2019m positive you\u2019ll have a good experience at your state school too. \n\nPlease allow yourself to be selfish right now and listen to your heart. What is it telling you right now? If you pretend that you\u2019ve chosen the state school, do you feel deeply disappointed that you\u2019re missing out on Emory, or do you feel relief that you won\u2019t have to worry about the financial situation?\n\nEdited to add:\nI work part time, but it\u2019s rough. If there\u2019s any way you don\u2019t have to work, I might choose that. But there are plenty of us that work on top of going to school full time.",

I know that for some people the cap is $2500 for the entire year but it really depends on what job you can work and the hours that they demand. I use my earnings mainly for grocery (I'm a senior not on a meal plan) so I'm not sure if work-study will help a lot with tuition-related expenses.",

          "text": "What type of grad. programs are we talkin' here? Like law? If so, what you said is true. Top law schools absolutely play favorites for unclear (likely prestige or relationship driven) reasons. Med. school only a little (mainly with the home med. school if it exists). MBA...eh, most won't take until after work experience anyway and admittedly, the networking and professional development infrastructure at most top tier or selective Us may help land something fruitful/marketable for those job experiences but I wouldn't call that a direct prestige effect.\n\nPhD and Masters is way more complicated. Rigor of coursework(accompanied by a decent performance), research experience, or other scholarly focused experiential learning opps or jobs are most helpful aside from getting a rec. letter from a famous research group.  Those prestige effects tend to be indirect as well as most grad programs don't receive huge application volume like professional schools. They have time to look at the details of a transcript, resume/CV to contextualize applicants. \n\nLike coming from a well overall ranked(via USNWR or w/e) isn't helpful if it doesn't look like you've done much to prep for graduate level work and research (as in a high GPA and a minimum/average curriculum in the area of interest will not be that helpful even coming from a top tier school. I've seen this play out even with those who were between med and grad who got into some med. schools but were denied grad. schools they assumed they were a shoe in to because they had high stats and a decent amount of research).\n\nMy point is that to benefit from any prestige bump applying to research based and scholarly focused programs(especially really well funded programs), you really have to even do a lot in the context of the prestigious school which may not be the easiest. For some of the professional schools, it is a very different story because some actually get additional prestige from saying \"we have so many people from this tier of school and they have these awesome test scores and inflated GPAs\" whereas grad. programs know they only benefit from those who can publish, bring in grant money, or write a solid thesis. All of those things are more tangible and less abstract and superficial than the former and it takes a lot more than just UG prestige to signal that you can bring in those benefits. \n\n  I would say that more selective research universities make it more likely that you'll be in a well-known (or known enough) research group and often give you more access to rigorous courses in your area(assuming the UG dept is well developed and large enough to have strong elective offerings).  But then you actually have to be willing to access all that which takes some courage in academically competitive universities.There is a tendency for some to get scared and start behaving like pre-professional students at places like Emory where they become way over-protective of their GPA and start dodging all the courses and opps that would help them most (and make them more marketable to more niche programs/subdisciplines) because they don't get that things like GPA is contextualized and assume that they merely need to get a high(as in like one of those med school/top prof. school level ones). They expect that and Emory's prestige to do all the work. You can't spend 20k extra and be like that as a pre-grad (maybe pre-med and pre-health, but not pre-grad if you want the best outcomes possible).",

Appeal your aid if you can but don't go here if the approval doesn't go your way.

          "text": "What I would say is that you should maybe figure this out by professor selection (and whether it has Q after it or not).  Like a lot of Oxford math professors will do things more akin to an honors class.  On main, you may get someone who isn't very challenging (or is flat out too easy) and probably won't even teach well so may make you stop liking math.  Go look over these syllabi:\n\n[https://app.oxford.emory.edu/WebApps/Directories/EResources/index.cfm?FuseAction=List&Criteria=Semester&Semester=2019.Fall](https://app.oxford.emory.edu/WebApps/Directories/EResources/index.cfm?FuseAction=List&Criteria=Semester&Semester=2019.Fall) and see which ones interest you  (I chose Fall 2019 because it was relatively \"normal\" and in person, but feel free to explore other semesters. It's your education) and maybe even take a math oriented discovery seminar.  Trust in saying that unless math 275/276 is offered, just take your intermediates and lower divisions at Ox.  Main campus, they'll likely just lecture at you and give you test and quizzes.  There won't be projects or even graded problem sets. It is pretty humdrum non-exciting math education whereas at least it looks like the Oxford courses are designed to be more immersive/to require more engagement with the material.  Often colleges courses are not about course number or even content, but how it is taught and how students are engaged.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, when I think things like linear algebra and multivariable, I think of courses that can either be taught purely calculation/plug and chug based (with maybe \"some' applications) vs. a more theory/proof based course or a hybrid.  A hybrid or a proofs based is better preparation for upper division courses or if you plan to go to grad school/enter competitions in it and I strongly suspect that Oxford faculty are more likely to lean in that direction (most faculty at ECAS are mostly researchers who probably think, often correctly that most students in intermediate math courses are majoring in something else and those courses are just pre-reqs/stepping stones and run their courses accordingly). Like you aren't going to get a Diff. Eq class like Michael Rogers' at ECAS. I'm just sorry.  And I started at ECAS and am a huge supporter of it but I have to be honest, taking math courses at ECAS isn't the way to stay excited about math as math is supposed to be studied and learned (hint: it isn't about repeating or regurgitating problem types you practiced or were shown in class).  Maybe if you want to feel like or pretend you are learning about it at a high level(by earning a high grade succeeding on tests that mostly require algorithmic problem solving), you can start at ECAS.  But if you look, Oxford has all the intermediates and goes up to math 250 (and offers a Q version of it) so you have more than enough options (some that seem way more immersive than any ECAS option, especially before 250) to be entertained.  It's not about just blasting through math requirements that are listed at a certain level.  Learn them the best you can.",

That is sort of the advantage of project based learning opps when available.  You can take control and decide or seek their guidance in deciding where you want to take it.  The problem sets and other things may be normalized, but that is an oppurtunity for some creativity or self-induced challenge on your part.  I am very sure Oxford faculty are more likely to be excited if you do ask about learning more as long as it isn't in a snooty or stuck up manner that gives the signal \"this class is beneath me\".",
