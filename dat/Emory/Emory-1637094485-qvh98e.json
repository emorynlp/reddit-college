          "text": "I\u2019m pretty sure the transfer rate was kept the same rate of 34%. The only thing that changed was the number of applicants who applied. This transfer class is the biggest one yet since they didn\u2019t anticipate so many people to come here since their yield is usually low. I think the transfer acceptance rate is actually gonna go down next year so it will be a little bit harder, but you should definitely be fine with a solid application.",
