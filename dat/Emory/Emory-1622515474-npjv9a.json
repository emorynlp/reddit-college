      "text": "My guess would be that most of those classes are not all that difficult to do well in or else you wouldn't get 80%+ of applicants with the mean GPA listed at the bottom of this page (If I had to guess, Calc. 1 and financial accounting may be the \"dent\" in some people's grades). \n Then there may also be an impact from the amount of pre-meds who convert/change to business):https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/admissions \n\nAnd I'd never recommend the risk of taking it at a CC because GBS sometimes seems very stringent on where they take credits from and will ask for a syllabi or some material to assess equivalency.  I've seen some transfers from 4 years that are generally deemed less rigorous or non-equivalent for whatever reason get denied econ. credits.\n\nFurthermore in the transfer section:https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/admissions\n they have this statement that suggests or implies that they may be hostile or unwelcoming of certain outside credits after you've already matriculated:\"GBS prefers students complete the majority of their business coursework here at Emory, so students with a number of business classes from another institution are not good transfer candidates.\"  You'll definitely be much more competitive if you even put up a decent performance in the Emory versions.  Just use gen. eds to balance out your schedule if you are that worried.\n\nEither way, you definitely wouldn't wanna do ISOM.",
