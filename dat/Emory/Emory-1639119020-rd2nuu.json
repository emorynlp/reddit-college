  "text": "Anyone ever take this course before? I don't really mind Dr. Malko's ratings on RMP although he seems flexible on his syllabus. I don't care about my GPA that much or anything like that. Just wondering if people here actually learned something from it.\n\nPhysics was most interesting to me out of all the prereqs for medical school, besides biochem. I'm not sure if I'm into stuff like radiology yet as my previous clinical experience makes me more interested in hands-on procedures. Interventional radiology could be interesting, but I heard it's competitive.\n\nA medical physics course seems like it could give me a sampling of what radiologists have to study in addition to their diagnostic techniques. I'm just not sure if this course is legit. Last semester so I gotta pick interesting courses!\n\nThanks in advance!",
