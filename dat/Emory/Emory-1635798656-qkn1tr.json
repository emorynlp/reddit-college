So I was wondering which FIN elective courses are the least time-consuming or are more theoretical than mathematical? \n\n[https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate/area-depths.pdf](https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate/area-depths.pdf)",

I did most of the concentration abroad though, and I\u2019d recommend that (it\u2019s pass fail). I heard M&A was fine though.",
