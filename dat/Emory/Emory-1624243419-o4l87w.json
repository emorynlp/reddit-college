  "text": "What was the IB predicted score that got you into Emory?\n\n(What about SAT and major extracurricular activities?)\n\nI know that the predicted scores are not everything Emory looks at, but I just want to have a little guidance in deciding whether I am likely for this school. I am a US student, and I am trying to apply ED with a current SAT 1510 and IB predicted 40\\~42.\n\nIf you could share your stats that would be very helpful.",

      "text": "I was under the impression that IB predicted scores were kinda irrelevant when applying to US schools. My schools didn\u2019t even tell me my predicted. Although I was class of 2020 so I never took those exams lmao. I was told to just care about getting a diploma and any additional points after that are just an ego boost. I got in with a 1540 SAT and took math history psych and English HL and French and physics SL and got 33 points.",

I had some prettty good activities (leading HR department for an organisation that teaches basketball for deaf children, creating a website to help reduce food wastage, to name a few) but I think Emory would care more about your character and what you do outside of school more than your numbers.",

      "text": "I was predicted a 40 with HL Literature, Economics, and Biology, and ended up with a 39. However, I do know someone at Emory who got a 30-ish on the IB so I wouldn't worry too much about scoring super high. My ACT was also a 32 with lots of extracurriculars and average teacher recs, so I would say you're probably fine so long as you have at least one other distinguishing feature.",

Emory isn\u2019t as big on test scores as other colleges anyway, so focus on improving other aspects of your application to give you your best chance.",
