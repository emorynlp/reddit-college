  "text": "So I submitted my Immunization form about 4 days ago into the EUSHS, and I received a message from them saying that I was compliant. However, on my OPUS portal, the status of this task has yet to have been updated as \u201ccompleted.\u201d I already emailed them, and they just told me that I was immunization \u201ccompliant,\u201d which I already knew. \n\nI also tried to place classes from the course atlas into my shopping cart, but it said that it was unavailable, and that that was because the course parameters were invalid. Could someone help me with this? Is this due to the incomplete status of my immunization form on OPUS?? I\u2019m so confused \ud83d\ude2d",

In July we\u2019ll get access to more OPUS stuff and we\u2019ll be able to see how many seats are available for our grade\n\nAre you working on Emory essentials in Canvas? It has some information on this",
