I on campus right now; I don't know if it works for off campus folks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Go to HBOmax and click \"sign in.\" [https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:home](https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:home)\n2. Click \"sign in through TV or mobile provider.\"\n3. Click \"view all providers.\"\n4. Scroll down and select Xfinity.\n5. Click the link where it says \"Xfinity On Campus students Sign in here\"\n6. Type in \"Emory University\" and hit submit.\n7. Sign in with your Emory NetID and password.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis might work on other stuff too. I had no idea we had Xfinity until very recently; sorry if this is already well known.",
