The other computer can be used to do homework. If none of the office staff is in, you can use your laptop, tablet etc. They are also pretty lenient with using your own computers when they are their. Basically get paid to do homework or play on your phone. Pay isn\u2019t great, but considering how little work you\u2019re actually doing it\u2019s like free money.",

Which means you aren\u2019t allowed to do much school work which defeats the purpose of a student job. You used to be able to use the desktops at SAAC but right now they\u2019re only being used for cameras and SAAC related stuff. This info was relayed to me by my roommate, I don\u2019t work there btw. Working at SAAC doesn\u2019t seem hard but it just seems like a nuisance.",
