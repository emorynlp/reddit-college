  "text": "Hello, my name is Sam Younis and I'm the owner of the Decatur location of Mathnasium located near Emory. We're currently looking for Emory students to work in-person at our location at:\n\n**1248 Clairmont Road, Decatur, GA 30030**\n\nWe have routinely hired Emory students since we opened our center back in 2014  and can offer some flexibility for those looking to balance their academic work with a fulfilling part-time job. We're looking for instructors with STEM backgrounds, strong interpersonal skills, and an ability to explain mathematics to kids of all ages. We're also looking for candidates with availability in the Monday-Thursday 2-7 range, with some work available on the weekends as well.\n\nWe're taking heavy precautions to mitigate any risk of COVID infection. We have reduced the maximum number of students allowed in the center, we require all students and instructors to wear facemasks at all times, we keep plexiglass shields between instructors and students, and we sanitize all surfaces heavily in between sessions.\n\n**If you're interested, feel free to fill out our online application at the following link:**\n\n[http://survey.alchemer.com/s3/1619657/Mathnasium-of-Decatur-Employment-Application](http://survey.alchemer.com/s3/1619657/Mathnasium-of-Decatur-Employment-Application)\n\nThanks so much!\n\nMathnasium Decatur\n\n[decatur@mathnasium.com](mailto:decatur@mathnasium.com)\n\n(404) 974-4690\n\n[www.mathnasium.com/decatur](http://www.mathnasium.com/decatur)",
