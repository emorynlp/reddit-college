  "text": "So my family (7 of us) used to make a bit over 100k, but never had any savings and were in debt. My dad lost his job last yeat and used his retirement to pay off debt and survive until he got a new job this year. He now makes 40k and is the sole income. I got my financial aid offer finally today and it was only 13k. Which means my cost pf attending will be more than ehat my family makes in a year. I want to use thw special circumstances form to appeal. Have any of you been successful with that?",
