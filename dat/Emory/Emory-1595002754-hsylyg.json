The only times you don't have to will probably be eating, showering/brushing your teeth, and sleeping. You can probably get away with not wearing a mask if you're in your room by yourself. The Campus Life office is still making guidelines about gatherings (big and small). I'm sure for larger groups of 5 or more people you would have to hang out at a distance from each other. You'll def wont be locked in your room all day by yourself (unless you choose to) but they don't want too many big gatherings that could increase the risk of covid spread",

Interacting with other students my first year was the highlight of my first year. Zoom is just not the same, especially since you will be adjusting to college for the first time. As a second year, I feel more okay about not returning to campus bc I have already made friends and I'm close w them and call them often. But as an incoming student, meeting your classmates through zoom might feel isolating and you may not feel as close to them. Being on campus, seeing other in person (although mostly at a physical distance) will help build stronger bonds. You may find it difficult to adjust to college or meet people (since they may already have formed friend groups) if we are able to go back later.\nHowever, it is a big financial commitment so please discuss w your family, weigh the pros/cons and think about what your Emory experiential expectations are!",
