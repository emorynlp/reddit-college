  "text": "The title, basically. I'm graduating this semester and upon reflection I've had nothing but awful or weird experiences here, even before COVID. I don't know what the problem is, I don't have an actual reason to not fit into the culture (ex. being an international student or first gen) but talking to people here always felt like trying to talk to a Powerpoint presentation and whenever I'm talking to coworkers that aren't from Emory the difference is just jarring. \n\nThe other aspect I really didn't like was how the med school and business school are breathing down the necks of everything that goes on academically and if you aren't premed or pre-business basically nobody has helpful advice for you. Asking for help re: anything just means that people keep referring you to the writing center or career center and when they're busy you get kicked around between CAPS, financial aid, and OUE until they forget about the email chain. Had to figure everything out alone and honestly I should have gone to a public school instead because sure, there's no support for the students, but at least they're not charging you extra like there is. \n\nDon't really have anyone to complain to irl because they either don't really care about college or think Emory is the best thing since sliced bread.",

Anyways, it's basically the feeling that it's hard to talk to people without cutting through 5 layers of formality and bureaucratic language even if it's a social context where being formal and standoffish makes no sense. I've also had a hard time talking to people about topics that can't be covered in a job training presentation or things that aren't their most recent lecture.\n\nMy coworkers have no problem talking to me about like, how their weekend went or good books they've been reading or just complaining about annoying shit that happened to them, so I don't think it's because I can't talk to people.",

          "text": "I don't think it reflects most people's experience and generally mileage varies at any college depending upon expectations.  Emory isn't for everyone, but generally people aren't gonna have the same experiences (it's kind of big) or could actually be more like the people that the OP says they didn't like (they would characterize the behavior differently than the OP).  But either way, that wasn't my experience and I didn't do pre-med or pre-business.  \n\nThe trick back then (and probably now and at almost any school) is that if you fall outside of those well-traveled paths, you'll need to make far better faculty connections and get mentoring from those within your department(s), as in the one you major(or minor/concentrate in).  You'll have to be more reliant on informal advising apparatuses which honestly isn't the worst thing to do.  In addition, they kind of only recently started beefing up the career center  and other things to help those outside of those pathways more from what I am seeing (just looking on the career center website and comparing to how it was back in the dino ages when I attended).  Everything comes down to how you approach things, the attitudes you have, and the \"friends\"(or acquaintances) you choose to associate with.  My friend crowd had a mix of demographics and career aspirations/majors so I saw much less of what the OP described as the \"powerpoint\" stuff. It probably would have been a duller experience had I affiliated with mostly pre-professionals.",

                  "text": "Oh absolutely but what I would say looking out for Emory (while being honest and realistic when I can be) as an alum is that more positive or even fun relatively positive shitposts of sorts could be positive for the school and I think it always helps to have some defenders(within reason. Not the delusional people who greatly exxagerate the effect of or even fabricate prestige and brand hierarchies) if there are happy people.  As of now, Emory has been getting more positive press and has higher quality of life rankings than it used to via things like PR (and unlike some places I don't think Emory cooks them up by passing the survey around in certain ways) but it still lacks the type of pride/or willingness to vouch for it that many of our peers(some that I actually think Emory is better than) have on this venue and others and that can cause problems especially when we get these negative posts.\n\n Emory is already associated with the \"no school pride\" and \"negative neds and nancies\" tropes.  It could go without it or with much less of it (and I definitely believe in constructive criticism but current students need to air that out and then try to get someone to do something about it).  But even when I see a post like the OP's, I deem it as fair but caution that others are not likely to have the same experience unless they weren't a fit for the school.at the very beginning.  The latter is honestly why I generally keep a positive attitude but also try to tell the truth about who Emory may fit and who it won't.  I definitely discourage this blind prestige/\"it's the highest ranked school I got into\" chasing stuff.  \n\nTo me Emory, JHU, CMU, Chicago, and even some of the Ivies should definitely have a \"type\" (beyond just being high achieving on paper) of student they yield. They aren't the catch-all type of elites with the school pride and social atmosphere that is almost universally appealing yet a place like Emory still gets lots of folks (maybe that 25 or 30% you allude to which is too high IMO) who wanted that type of experience and would have actually been happier at a public school in its honors program or something.",

They don't even wanna believe that for COMPETENCY based disciplines that they'll need more than a fancy name on their degree and transcript because that means they'll have to work harder in and out the class room to ensure they develop and maintain those competencies.  No one seriously thinks the big CS feeders, for example, are such because they ACTUALLY have unusually strong training AND a bunch of majors that will naturally throw applications at these companies (or that the schools have done what they need to do to establish relationships and pipelines to those companies).  People describe prestige as if it is this magical thing where a hiring manager or exec. in a company sees a fancy(and most of these people will think the USNWR rank is = to how fancy the name is) name on a degree and just loses it with this sort of super excitement before they look at the resume or CV to gauge the credentials.  And again, aren't a lot of tech companies doing these pre-interview challenges now-a-days?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*What worries me is that I have been seeing people prop this idea that undergrad prestige is important for pre-med and that one is totally misleading people as elite schools have just as much attrition, if not more, in gateway STEM courses than less elite public counterparts.  The only thing that matters is if you can actually do well in the courses and on the MCAT.  And some schools (like Emory) definitely offer courses and professors that help with the latter, but if you don't wanna take them/are scared to, then they should go pay less elsewhere and use the extra free time on their hands from not studying or doing the course work (because it may be easier to them, or they can ride a curve and ensure a strong GPA against a weaker student body) to pre-prep for the MCAT or do additional ECs/volunteering/shadowing. But this stuff about some places other than Emory med. seeing an Emory undergrad with less than stellar credentials and coursework and say \"Well they went to Emory, so give them a huge boost\"...I never saw evidence for, and the same trend holds for \"near peers\".",

Even for like marketing positions, we have prospective hires do a small project before we'll interview them (i.e. write a fake product page or press release, or put together a campaign idea for something). What they turn in there is like 99% of the equation when it comes to whether or not they get an interview. A related degree is a prerequisite, but we really don't care where it's from.",

I'm down with it as universities should be encouraging students to do more authentic learning and approach more authentic problems (or projects) even in the classroom.  The class room shouldn't just be this thing that gives you a grade and then you leverage the inflated/easily earned grade to get an internship where you learn literally everything the courses didn't prepare you for.",

If they had to tap into the alumni network (which may have had limited use if there were massive layoffs and effective  hiring freezes were still in place) and that clearly got them somewhere then we'd be having a different discussion.\n\nOutside of alumni pull, unless you are from the schools with super social capital and infiltration of certain career sectors (and we know who most of them are), it will be competence (which may include grades) and experience that rules the day. Emory is well selected so people are likely to get those things whether the school and curriculum they pursued is anything special or not and most high achievers would have cherrypicked their way to success at most 4 year institutions thet attended.\n\n*Also the career center was severely under developed back then so I am inclined to believe this person.  Many at Emory DO just do it on their own.  \n\nSo the stuff you are saying IS weird and just flies in the face of data we see on this (when you control for the incoming achievement metrics on students). People from certain backgrounds definitely benefit from \"coddling effects\" of elites but whites and Asians and those of mid and high wealth levels would have been fine at any decent 4 year institution. \"Elite\" privates and publics get to be enriched for these students more so than most schools outside of that group.",
