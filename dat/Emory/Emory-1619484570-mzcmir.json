  "text": "Hi Everyone- I'm starting at Emory in the fall for grad school and I'm worried about housing. I'm shopping online from afar and the reviews for most complexes are terrible. Between roaches/bug infestations, break-ins, and car thefts/vandalism, I haven't really identified any great options to live. \n\nSo...where do grad students live? Please let me know where you've lived with a positive experience, and where I should absolutely stay away from. HELP!",

      "text": "I've heard many grad students live at Gables, Clairmont reserve and Decatur highlands. If you don't have a car, they are an okay distance to walk to one of Emory's shuttle stop at Clairmont campus. The closest apartments (walkable distance) to the main campus are Emory Point and Emory Woods. \n\nEmory point, though, could be loud on the weekends depending on your luck with neighbors and have some roach problems. \n\nThere are other apartments further away like Atlantic Briarcliff, Point on Scott, Scott crossing and Inkwell, but I'm not sure if they have convenient transportation.\n\nIf you are looking for a quiet and peaceful space I would recommend Clairmont reserve.\n\n[https://offcampushousing.emory.edu/](https://offcampushousing.emory.edu/)\n\nThis is emory's official off campus housing website and maybe this could help you connect with other grad students about housing!",
