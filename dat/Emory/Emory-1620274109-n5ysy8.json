  "text": "Is it possible to have been admitted off the Emory at Oxford College waitlist earlier than May 1? I heard some people say they were admitted last Saturday but that wouldn\u2019t make sense because potentially all admitted students could commit and then they wouldn\u2019t have room. If they had room they would have admitted more students to begin with.",

      "text": "I think anything is possible.  You're seeing it at other top tier universities.  They probably have years (or decades) worth of data that gives them some idea of how many people would have committed by a certain time (I doubt they just sit around until and wait until the deadline to make decisions because then they have to compete with a larger pool of schools that may indeed decide to wait to start pulling.  Point being, they probably have info. and data we aren't aware of that drive their decisions) and that could determine whether they tap into the waitlist and how soon they do so.  And some places can have bad yield prediction formulas (especially Emory which is why it probably over-admits versus most peer institutions.  It doesn't do much in the way of yield protection and likely doesn't understand its niche of students very likely to commit from RD OR just doesn't have a niche other than broad categories like \"pre-med\" or \"pre-business\" or whatever commonly taken pre-professional paths at most elite privates) where they have a target enrollment number and miss it significantly in either direction",
