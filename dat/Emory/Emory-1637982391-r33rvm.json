  "title:": "New Student Org for Making Friends",
  "text": "Looking to start a new chapter at Emory of a student organization that\u2019s main goal is to help students make new friends on-campus. The organization is not religiously or politically affiliated and events would be open to all students. All events would be intentionally designed to help students mix/mingle, have conversations with people they might not otherwise have met, and find new people to hang out with. They would include a variety of different types of casual activities to appeal to various interests. I\u2019ve seen several threads on here with people wanting to make more friends and know that it\u2019s even tougher than normal coming out of COVID, so want to create something that would be actually be useful. If anyone has any ideas of how things they\u2019d like to see this group manifest or cool events it could do, we welcome any input! Also, if you\u2019d be interested in being a part of bringing this org to campus or getting involved with it, feel free to comment or send me a dm to get connected!",
