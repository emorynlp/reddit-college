  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, I\u2019m super excited to start my freshmen year, but looking at classes has naturally stressed me out a bit.\n\nGiven the options for Fall 2019/Spring 2020, any recommendations for Freshmen Seminars that are fairly easy/fun? I\u2019m thinking of majoring in Anthropology and Human Biology with premed in mind, but I wouldn\u2019t mind at all doing a non-STEM seminar. I\u2019ll also be swimming and working, so my schedule is already kinda busy.\n\nSecondly, going with that major idea, should I take Bio and Chem 141/150 with their labs in the first semester? I have the AP Bio credit, but I\u2019m hesitant to use it because premed. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll get the AP Calc AB credit, so any suggestions about what maths I should when?\n\nThanks and go Eagles!",

      "text": "For freshman seminar I heard the Econ one is easy/fun. Also I strongly recommend Prof.Reynolds\u2019s film seminar which is also really fun and the workload is not bad at all,and it\u2019s all about the basic stuff so even if you\u2019re not a film major it would still be easy.  but there\u2019s weekly screenings so you might wanna look out for that. In terms of taking bio and chem together, I have several friends who had done that and it was definitely hard, but doable if you\u2019re willing to put in the time and effort, also because they\u2019re both with labs so it\u2019s gonna be time consuming. In terms of using your ap bio credits, maybe you can email the professor and asking about their opinion. For your ap AB credit, it can replace the Math 111 which is the only math requirement for the GER. So if you don\u2019t want to you don\u2019t have to take any math classes (unless it\u2019s required by your major)",

          "text": "Is the econ seminar still \"Economics of Crime\" with Alison? I took it 2 years ago; wouldn't exactly call it fun but it was interesting, and very easy. Work consisted of one paper, a short 1 paragraph reflection each class, and 2 exams. It was good for me, as an econ class for non-econ folks.\n\nUsing AP Bio credit for 141 is fine, upper-level classes will cover the same marerial better. I would *not* skip Chem150 as Emory's chem curriculum has changed and doesn't reflect AP Chem topics well.",

      "text": "Hey, a seminar is a seminar, so don't assume that a STEM seminar is going to be more \"busy\" than non-STEM seminars.  I assure that is not the case for the most part.  However, if you want to take non-STEM seminars because you want to explore interest in other areas,  I encourage that.   Either way, don't go in thinking \"STEM= high rigor and others don't\" with regards to seminars.  It is actually more likely than a non-STEM seminar would give significant writing, exams/quizzes, or serious assignments.  Workloads of most STEM seminars are mainly just reading and discussing (participation), and maybe a presentation or discussion leading at one point in time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Also, consider taking lab only for bio 141.  It is not that useful to retake 141 unless you can get a top instructor (may De Rhoode).  As a pre-med, even if you are not a biology major, you will and SHOULD likely take some upper division or intermediate biology and/or chemistry courses that help prepare you for the MCAT and those will compensate for use of AP bio credit for 141 (especially since you still had to take 141L).  You ideally should be considering extra biology courses that emphasize reading primary literature/experimental applications in biology (which the MCAT will emphasize on the bio and chem oriented passage based items).  Options include bio 241, 264, 250, and many of the 300-400 special topics courses that open up after you take 142.  Either way, don't worry about that as the intro. biology sequence should not be the only exposure to bio courses you end up getting.",
