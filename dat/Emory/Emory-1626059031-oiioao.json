      "text": "This is not the right sub unless you\u2019re asking if there are internships for high schoolers at Emory, which honestly have no clue. I\u2019d actually post in the Atlanta subreddit if that\u2019s where you live or see what you can find in your city. \n\nI don\u2019t think internships as a whole are that \u201cimpressive\u201d though in the sense that they aren\u2019t going to raise an eyebrow. You can engage other in activities related to your interests if you can\u2019t find one. Like someone else mentioned, your school can probably help you with more information on all of this.\n\nAlso, noticed you\u2019re a rising junior. There are definitely a lot more summer programs you can apply to at universities. Some of them can be helpful. Usually fly-ins are interesting too and if you get accepted to them they can help your chances of getting into the university where the fly-in is hosted (although usually you need to be of a low-income background I think to apply). They\u2019ll probably open again next summer.",
