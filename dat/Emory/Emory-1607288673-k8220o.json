  "text": "Hello all! I'm currently in a gap year after deferring my enrollment to Emory Oxford due to the pandemic.. These past few days I have been having an odd inner turmoil that I never would have expected.\n\nBefore decision day I had narrowed it down to two choices: Emory and UT Austin. My decision to go to Emory was one made ignoring financials, it is going to be very debt heavy after four years and UT would be around $10k less than my school previously. The reason I chose Emory was for the education and small class/school environment that Oxford provided. I am now more on the fence as I realize I probably could do well at both schools, one with a bit of an advantage for my emotional state and the attention teachers can give, the other with a huge financial advantage.\n\nI do also realize that with the pandemic there may not be a huge change going into the next year. There may still be online classes and such and in a way I would miss out on the experience Oxford was going to give me, so why not save the money?\n\nIf anyone has anything to chime in with opinions in regards to class size or financials or anything of the sort, I would really appreciate it as I move into potentially making a decision.",

It might be a little bit more emotionally taxing than you think. I know some people who really thrived at Oxford but there are a fair amount of mental health issues on the campus fair warning. It also depends on what subject you intend on going into. Sciences and business are strong at Emory but I think UT is more well rounded?",

      "text": "UT Austin.  Save the money.  They are both great schools, so you should choose the cheapest option IMO,  The idea of the top 20-25 is way over-rated outside of maybe the top 10 ranked schools in USNWR and a few schools that kind of have unusual strengths in key areas (like Michigan, CMU for engineering and CS and Georgetown for political science and areas that tend to lead to political careers).  UT Austin has a good enough name, large enough alumni network and pull to get you wherever.  You will eventually get access to fairly small classes at UT Austin and may even be able to tap into one of the many honors programs they have.  I think you'll be alright.  If they were the same price, then I might tell you to consider Oxford, but they aren't.",

If you get a merit scholarship or fall below a certain threshold, the private can end up cheaper. Not the case for OP though so they should probably just go to UT especially if they are in a competitive major or track and have academic advantages over other students.",

          "text": "Emory main cares about rigor or are we talking Oxford?  In what departments?  A lot of STEM courses for example, have definitely been watered down versus a non-Covid course in terms of the INTELLECTUAL rigor demanded (not to say that was consistent in the first place).  From what I have been seeing and hearing (especially in chemistry and biology courses, which would be considered jokes if conducted in a standard year like they were now.  The demands are often significantly higher), it looks like in many courses, they've basically traded that in for giving students a higher low stakes workload with less accountability for being able to do higher level stuff on high stakes assessment (so instead of grades being majority determined by 3 or 4 fairly demanding exams like a normal year, exams are significantly easier. lower weighted, and the rest of the grade has increased weight and is spread across other assignments as well as pre-class prep that may or may not have existed pre-Covid depending on if the class was already \"flipped\" or not).\n\nBut even before Covid, I would never characterize \"Emory\" as caring about rigor though there are certainly many (including a lot of awesome) professors (perhaps more than some peers) who do care about a meaningful sort of rigor (intellectual/demanding deep learning vs. just constant assignment due dates of things of lower and medium intensity) along with teaching quality.  I always thought Oxford was the one known for CONSISTENT rigor no matter the teaching quality or instructor.  At ECAS, there is so much choice, that you could dodge rigorous professors if you want so I don't quite agree.  I just think the rigor that is left probably looks different during Covid than a normal year.  I admittedly have heard that departments like QTM have kind of held up nearly normal standards for intellectual rigor on high stakes assessments while also having projects and assignments piling up on people.  Either way, I also imagine the quality has deteriorated vs. in person instruction (partly because most instructors got like a summer crash course in virtual instruction and never dealt with it before. PhDs are NOT trained for it)  so maybe courses still feel quite challenging even if the intellectual demands are technically much lower, and I admit I feel for y'all there.\n\nI just can't say for sure all that is happening with Covid, but in a normal year, there is no particular standard or consistency in \"rigor\", no matter how you define it, at ECAS.  It is all over the place.  If the upcoming year is anything like normal and a student doesn't want too much rigor, I wouldn't be worried. It is easy to dodge (for your benefit or detriment).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother problem is that UT Austin for major STEM and pre-med STEM courses is often every bit just as rigorous as like a medium rigor Emory course in the same areas, and this definitely goes for normal years.  And at UT Austin, the courses are larger so may be completely graded based upon exams and quizzes vs. a bunch of low stakes stuff.  Elite/selective public schools can be VERY harsh for pre-meds.  Emory and Oxford may make some courses more intellectually demanding by covering harder topics, but they are smaller and find ways to have lots of the total grade not be tied to difficult high stakes exams which gives most students a higher chance at a solid grade.  Generally I wouldn't discourage people from choosing a selective private over a selective public for pre-med unless it was like an MIT, Caltech sort of situation if they were the same price.  I think many students under-estimate the rigor of undergraduate STEM (especially the grading schemes) at these well-known flagship publics.",

They did end up giving us more busy work, but exams were weighted the same. My chem class actually cut one exam so the stakes were higher on the others. \n\nThe reason I specifically chose the word rigor is because in every town hall when students complain about how the tuition price hasn\u2019t been lowered despite the fact that quality of education certainly has, we\u2019re told that \u201cEmory upholds a certain level of rigor\u201d so our tuition aligns with that rigor. They are very careful to not say anything about the education or college experience being the same, just the rigor. \nYou might be able to dodge the rigor in Atlanta, but you can\u2019t at Oxford without altering your major/timeline.",

I think Oxford being smaller makes it easier to maintain a similar style of rigor to a normal year but on main, things like the gen. chem and ochem tests and gen bio (and intermediate bio courses) aren't even close to what is given in a normal year and you are talking even in the hands of instructors known to be high quality and rigorous (De Roode, Spell in bio and Weinschenk, Soria, and McGill in chem come to mind).  They are far more intense during the year and the inability to do the higher level thinking costs much less this sem. because the exams are de-weighted and simpler (like the items that require higher level thinking are either absent or diminished in abundance vs. a normal year)\n\nI know gchem on main had some new \"group question\" component that had some challenging items on them but together they only weighted 10%.  In reality those psets had questions typically asked on exams that weighted 15-20% EACH in a normal year.  I think the Covid19 conditions for learning just makes stuff feel harder and believe me I understand it.  It isn't optimal whatsoever.  My guess is that on ECAS, many profs. underestimated how much the conditions affect student performance. Like I know the ochem averages are in line with a normal year despite the easier exams.",

I actually even expect them to be higher (though not spring 2019 levels).  The best way to make a prediction is to compare this semester's syllabus to say...fall 2019.  Whichever semester ends up with the higher test weighting will likely have the lower cohort GPA assuming the tests were at the same level/style (because it seems first years primarily have difficulty adjusting to college style midterms.  Usually doing and scoring well on any busy work or low stakes assignments is less of a problem).  So if the test weighting was lower this sem. and had similar averages or whatever, the grades this sem. will still be higher.  I wouldn't read to much into effects on GPAs (typically freshmen STEM classes and STEM major/pre-med core courses are on the lower side of things at both campuses) though again, considering how things must \"feel\" right now, I get why you think they would be lower.  But I just know that in spring 2019, even if you take out the P/F option, the move to online learning was a boon for GPAs.  I expect something more intermediate between that and like Fall 2019 for spring 2020 as the courses have been completely recalibrated to feel more \"normal\" (vs. having to suddenly switch to online and not knowing limitations of technology and whatnot) AND undergrads are probably just burnt out with this mess.  Either way, good luck with finals!  I suspect you'll be fine, and you'll get better in spring or in sophomore year.  The conditions should hopefully improve so that it doesn't feel as taxing and isolating.",

I was in chem 150 at the time, and my professor emailed us PDFs of our last two exams, gave us a 12 hour time period to fill them out and send them back. Those two exams had an average 12 points higher than the previous semester, for obvious reasons. The case was pretty similar in all of my classes. As far as the GPAs go, I know for a fact that Oxford STEM classes haven\u2019t changed the weight of their exams. I think a few might have changed the weight of the final to be worth the same as a regular test, but I don\u2019t actually know. I do know that the majority of people that I\u2019ve talked to say that their grades this semester are the worst they\u2019ve ever been. \n\nI don\u2019t know how Atlanta structured their STEM classes, but I worked for at least 3 hours a day outside of class on each STEM class. They gave us so much busy work that accounted for maybe 5% of our grade. Several students had the issue of having to devote so much time to extra work that they didn\u2019t have the time to learn the material in a way that worked for them. Also, as a result of spring ending the way that it did, several teachers this year didn\u2019t realize that the majority of students hadn\u2019t actually completed the prerequisite class, and that was why there was such a gap in understanding. \n\nTo be fair, my humanities classes both at Oxford and Atlanta have been great. They both made adjustments both before and during the semester to make things manageable for students. I think those grades will probably be up, but I really do expect a noticeable drop in STEM grades.",

                                  "text": "Oh I totally know why spring 2019 occurred.  Like I said, current STEM courses even on main are receiving similar test averages and whatnot even though they are less complex.  The difference is that they are weighted significantly less so it doesn't \"hurt\" as much to earn those scores.  Overall, I would anticipate like B+ averages in gchem and gbio on main unless they give a hellish final. B-(maybe B in bio) is typical at Emory.  Ochem, I don't know.  \n\nThose tests are weighted more than gchem and the averages are still lackluster for people like Weinschenk so it may end up being like a normal year with a B-/B average post curve.  If fall 2021 is \"normal\" at ECAS, then those grades will drop back down unless they have some type of compromise between how they run courses now vs. then (like maybe they start giving the hard exams again but don't increase the weighting back to normal and keep a lot more of low stakes work as part of it. I dunno). \n\n I would also take into account for STEM sophomores that certain courses are just damned hard.  Like chem 203 is freaking hard at both campuses simply due to the curriculum and I suspect most sophomores there are taking it now. chem 203 is actually substantially harder than most near ranked (ochem at Emory pre-chem unbound was already hard due to key profs but the new curric. basically made ALL profs center the same concepts as the harder ones) peer institution (Emory's 203 curric. looks more like something that you'd see at Harvard, Stanford, Caltech, MIT, than like a Cornell, Vandy, Rice, ND.  Among near ranked schools, only WUSTL compares. Everyone else's looks more \"standard\") ochem classes because it centers MO theory and uses an Oxbridge arrangement of topics which differs a lot from.standard American ochem.courses where ochem 1 starts with material covered at the end of chem 150.   Biology at Oxford is also a beast (lesser so the case for main.\n\n Main has some challenging intermediate and upper division bios though) in terms of sheer workload and complexity of the material and I saw the syllabus that vouched for the fact that it was trying to maintain a similar rigor to a normal year (for example, they added takehome components to the exams. My understanding is that Ox bio profs tend to give more applied/problem solving focused exams even in a strictly timed setting).  \n\nEither way, it is typical for sophomores to struggle in STEM classes due to sheer difficulty. Plus I imagine many take physics then too?  I feel like physics and gbio profs at Oxford are like the gchem and ochem profs at ECAS.  They tend to be the real trouble spots with professors that make their courses \"unusually\" challenging even if compared to analogous courses at other selective schools.  Not sure \"normalcy\"would save many sophomores.  It definitely won't feel like freshman year.  \n\n*Random-sounds like you described chem 202 with the pre-req mess.  I imagine that sucks.  Was it mainly those who APed out or was it randoms who found a loophole in OPUS?",

If there is a department that can care less about undergraduate teaching, especially doing it rigorously, it's math.  That would of course be bad if you were entertaining graduate school/research because you actually need to know how to do and think about math conceptually for graduate research and studies, but if you were just pre-med, you could have found GPA boosting professors for the remainder where they make you sort of just repeat HW exercises/problems on exams.  Oxford is actually rigorous and trains in math like most other LACs do (or like honors courses at research Us with top UG math programs would, both which mirror more of what one would need for grad. school.  Like on main, you have many professors too into their research to teach that way.  You just sort of do as they tell you: No creativity requested).",

Honestly, unless you are trying to get into some of those ultra selective psych or neuroscience PhD programs vs. just getting a job (except like finance or something)/research position, your GPA will matter very little (even then, lots of research experience or relevant experiential learning/jobs, which is expected and ideal, can overcome GPA issues especially if you take and do well in relevant upper divisions/electives in whatever field. Grad. schools and most employers are kind of less into superficial indicators of learning/competence and more into specifics so at least you no longer have to move like a pre-med trying to manufacture the perfect transcript and avoid all the \"harder\" psych classes.  You can try harder ones if they interest you for sure.  No need to feign perfection anymore) Experiences/internships will be most important and you don't need to be anywhere near academically perfect to access those.  You may want to entertain the new psych BS program though.",
