  "text": "Hi, I was recently admitted to Emory and was wondering if anyone knows how many students Goizueta admits? I read a 2018 article that claimed 77-95%, but I'm not sure if the article is credible (I haven't been able to find the info anywhere else), and I'm also not sure how much it has changed in recent years. I'm fairly confident that I want to study business, so I'd like to attend a school that I will likely be able to study business at. Thanks in advance for your help!",
