      "text": "I wouldn\u2019t say it was easy but it wasn\u2019t impossible either. It\u2019s hard to make *many* friends. Like 10-15+. I don\u2019t drink myself, but I\u2019ve been seeing people using cars to go out into the city. I\u2019ve been mainly just like eating/studying/walking around places with people, and also watching stuff together. I\u2019ll probably go trick or treating with some people on Saturday too.\n\nI think it\u2019s better for you to come to campus. It might be harder to make friends your sophomore year too. A possible scenario may even be that they let the next year\u2019s freshmen come to campus and have us stay online. I don\u2019t regret coming here at all (plus I love the weather here compared to NYC).",

      "text": "Right now most people are hanging out off campus because of restrictions about visiting people from other buildings etc. and the usual hangout spots like Kaldi's and Starbucks being severely limited. \n\nI have seen a lot of people just having picnics on the quad or the stairs on the student center so that's a decent substitute as long as the weather is OK",
