  "text": "How doable is it to take NBB 301 without a strong foundation in physics? The website says they highly recommend you take it after PHYS 142 or concurrently. I haven\u2019t taken physics since high school.\n\nDoes NBB 302 build off of 301 significantly? I may just hold off on taking either until I take physics",

      "text": "NBB 301 does require a background in physics, and if you want to do well it's not recommended to play catch up if your last exposure was high school. This is the biology side of neuroscience. There are few upper-level electives that straight up require 301 anyway, so you can take your time.\n\nNBB 302 is separate from NBB 301. It's the psychology side of neuroscience. I recommend taking this one to get it out of the way since it does not require science prereqs. I think it's also been offered as a Maymester course if you're feeling bold.\n\nEnjoy physics 141/142, loved Dr. Bing.",

      "text": "Just a heads up, I'm in 301 now without Phys 142 experience and it really is doable, you just need to maybe practice more problems and go to office hours, they designed it for those who didn't have a background so it's not actually expected of you. Plus the physics is really only in the first unit of the class.",

      "text": "It may depend on who is teaching.  Like I think you can for sure learn it on the spot (and many people who don't have physics first succeed that way) but I also think Frenzel's spring sections (which I do recommend) are a bit more demanding in terms of how well you have to understand it ands its applications and it is more likely to show up across units (because she believes in being cumulative) versus just exam 1 and and a portion of exam 2.  I guess it just depends on how well and comfortable people are at picking it (mainly a few physics 142 concepts) up on the spot.  For those who don't think they can invest the time up front when they join the course to remediate (or straight up learn it for the first time) quickly, then it may be best to just have 142 over with.  Also, if NBB 301 is back to \"normal\" in future semesters, I'd expect the fall section (especially when Lui is involved) to be tougher than normal, especially on those first 2 exams.",
