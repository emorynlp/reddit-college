  "title:": "All (but 2) Freshman Seminars Closed on Atlas? Confused",
  "text": "According to the course atlas, all but two Freshman Seminars are closed. If I add a closed Freshman Seminar to my shopping cart, since it allows me to, will it mean that I just won't get it when registration comes around? If I add a closed course that's not a Seminar, e.g. MATH 221 - 11 with Pittman, will that be useless as well? Or am I just not understanding the whole registration process correctly. Would love if someone could explain the registration process starting from adding courses to your shopping card to actually enrolling in them. I'm actually losing brain cells tryna figure it out myself.",

      "text": "They are just closed rn since we don\u2019t start registration until august. Just keep them in your cart and they will open when freshman registration opens up. This is all I know with the seminar ones bc that\u2019s only for freshman. Idk about the other class though. Have you completed the walkthrough in Emory essentials?",
