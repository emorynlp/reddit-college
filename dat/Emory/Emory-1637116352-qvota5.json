      "text": "I took ant 230 but haven\u2019t taken soc 230. Ant 230 was a wonderful class and Dr Peter Brown is a special professor\u2026definitely get the chance to learn from him before he retires. Ant 230 considers the practice of medicine from a multicultural lens, with many case studies of specific cultures. The class is easy overall (lots of reading, but you can skim) with 2 exams, 2 papers and some sporadic homework assignments.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve heard, soc 230 is not as interesting of a class (if others have differing opinions, let me know! I\u2019ve wanted to take it for a while but have heard not great things) but I don\u2019t know much about it.",
