  "text": "I have a few questions about commencement.\n\nIs there a ceremony for the entire class of 2021 or is it only school specific (CAS, Goizueta, Nursing)? \n\nThe email and commencement schedule makes it seem like it\u2019s school specific. I guess because of COVID? \n\nWhat if I have friends in other schools that I want to take pictures with. Would that not be possible? \n\nAlso, do we physically walk to get our diplomas? Or are they just calling out our names and we stay seated?",
