      "text": "In the info session, they said that about 200 students usually apply. I'd honestly guess it's more than that this year since so  many students had high gpas due to online classes. \n\nAnd what the other guy said is correct. About 20 students receive some sort of scholarship (some are recurring, others are one-time) and four of those students receive full rides for their remaining time at Emory.",
