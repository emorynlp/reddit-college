  "text": "Hey guys, so I\u2019m commuting and have an online class 15 minutes before an in-person class in Few Hall a couple times a week. I\u2019m planning on getting to campus before my online class and just taking that here. Does anyone know any good spots that are fairly quiet but I won\u2019t be bothering anyone if I need to speak? Tomorrow will be my first time on campus lol. Thanks in advance!",

The bio libs is also a good place to study intensely.\n\nOtherwise there\u2019s tons of study space at Candler or Atwood. Also, the center of spiritual  religious life at Cannon Chapel has tons of quiet study spaces. No religious affiliation needed \u270c\ufe0fI\u2019m a witchy Methodist, and was always welcome there. They probably saved my life at least once",
