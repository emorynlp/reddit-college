  "text": "Hey guys,   \nSo I just got my AP scores today and have earned sufficient credit for Micro/Macro Econ, Stats, Calc, and English 185 (I'll be at Ox so my stats credit should satisfy math 117). Obviously I can only use 12 of these credits so which class do you think I should take? I know for sure i'm skipping Math 111 and Math 117, but do you think I should take a Micro/Macro class or an English class?",
