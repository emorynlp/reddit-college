  "text": "As an ED1 applicant, is an ACT score of 32 good enough to submit? I am hoping to improve to atleast a 33 in the upcoming Oct 23 test. However, my ED application will be due prior to the score being released. I have a weighted GPA of 4.24, strong ECs and am out of state. I am applying for the dual degree business/engineering program. Thank you",

              "text": "if your gpa are is on the upper end of the curve, it can make up for the lower quartile ACT, and the school can still be considered a match. if they both are on the lower end, no big deal, it\u2019s just considered a reach and it\u2019s good to have a couple of those. \n\nWhen I applied I had bottom 10th percentile GPA and top 10th SAT, so they balanced each other out in a sense. None of it is so simple and straightforward, but the point is that a 32 doesn\u2019t knock you out of the running and you should certainly ED with that if you really like Emory (I knew people who got in in with a 28. people, as in plural)",
