      "text": "Let me check in with my friend who knows more about the business school than I do, but my impression is that you don't need to take ISOM yet especially if you arent positive business is something you want to do. You can absolutely still take it, yes, but the fact that most people don't as freshmen leads me to my second point which is that you may find it tough to get into ISOM and should have at least backup option. Otherwise this schedule looks pretty good - you have some work intensive classes but with only 15 credits you'll have plenty of time. Also I'd recommend a reading oriented FSEM - with ISOM, CS and ECON you'll likely feel like you're doing a lot of math oriented work.",

ISOM is a pretty hard class so I really don't recommend taking CS and ISOM at the same time. ISOM is different from the typical high school stats classes. I still recommend you take ACT 210 which is a bit more manageable and since you're still exploring the bschool",
