  "text": "I was wondering, given the gender disparity on campus, if somehow the hottest girls lower their expectations for guys (since there are less of them). I've actually heard the term \"Emory goggles\" used by female students to describe the dating pool on campus. This seems to be the opposite of most schools if guys are the ones more \"in demand.\" Is there some truth to this?",

Although, to be fair, I think if I went to a place like Georgia Tech where the opposite is true I would try & date people outside of my university.\n\nActually, don\u2019t know \u2014 the answer and reasoning behind it might be complicated. I guess, at the very least, you can conclude that it\u2019s slightly easier to meet girls at Emory because of its imbalanced gender ratio.",
