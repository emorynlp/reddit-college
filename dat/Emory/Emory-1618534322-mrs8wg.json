      "text": "I'm from main campus, and I don't really know for sure, but I heard there was only one guy running and he was accused of sexual assault by an anonymous submission of some sort? \n\nBecause of this, I saw people campaigning to try and convince Oxford students to vote no confidence and they overwhelmingly did. Therefore, no one was elected to the position. Idk what they're gonna do now.",
