The international student body is an excellent opportunity to learn about other cultures and explore new cuisines. \n\nHeaps of advice for pre-med students. GPA and MCAT are king and queen. Research is vitally important for top tier med schools since they always want more research output. Studying for the MCAT is like building a sand castle right along the shore line. The tides represent time decay, study hard and quickly for max results. \n\nFeel free to DM with any questions, sometimes the advisors aren\u2019t quite accurate with their advice.",

I had many that would claim they were misadvised or told to do weird things like change their major or take classes in a dept they weren't interested in to boost their GPA (and of course it would fail).  \n\nDo you think there is any truth to this from your experience (eventually I just started telling people to trust them in everything but course selection advice)? I just notice that the entrance success rates haven't changed that dramatically since their establishment or the start of the committee letters.  The best I can do is recommend good professors and study/thinking strategies. I never knew what to do when PHA gives students advice that is not aligned with advice given at peer schools with higher success rates and it is hard to convince students that a supposed authority figure may be wrong. They really wanna believe in the PHA when its efficacy seems limited so far.",

Too many don't and kind of just take those memory based courses(like biol 14x may be the most critical and analytical thinking they have done for a biol class and depending on who they took, it may not be much) which in a way reflect med. school but aren't as great for MCAT prep.  I feel like a mix of those and research focused courses with journal article reading is ideal priming for the MCAT studying (like it helps to be used to reading journal articles and authentic figures in STEM vs. seeing passages that use them for the first time when you start studying.  Learning to adapt to that and then also reviewing content has to be a lot I imagine) and med. school especially in case a student never joins a research team.  After all, most Emory students already are excellent at textbook learning and regurgitating and displaying basic understanding of content from K-12.  All they gotta do is step it up some.  \n\nAs for padding, students should know that there are good classes that emphasize certain skills but are also  easy to get good grades in and are sometimes in a STEM dept.  Evolutionary biology is one of them IMO (because the content is kind of intuitive).  It usually doesn't emphasize \"medically related\" material but analyzing figures, data, and experimental design is something good to pick up and often they do a good job selecting cases that are ultimately tied back to molecular bio and other bio disciplines that pre-meds I think would find useful.  Sometimes it is about finding the right padders with the right teachers I think.",
