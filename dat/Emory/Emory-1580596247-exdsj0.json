Too many act like they can't do anything or go nowhere because: name the excuse.  They acted like actual UGA students which I'm sure many on either campus wished more students did lol.",

It\u2019s so small that it\u2019s kind of like a study in human behavior. \n\nIt has good parts too. OP feel free to message me if you have any more specific questions",

                      "text": "Oh I know, I was just sayin lol.  Main campus is big but some people love making excuses for why they don't (or claim they can't) do things, develop/promote development of their own traditions (beyond the few lackluster ones they have), go places etc.  They blame admins for tapering down on Greeklife or lack of D1 as if a fun,creative person absolutely needs Greeklife and sports to socialize (whether on campus or in Atlanta), public transportation, whatever.   Again, those Oxford kids just went out and did something without any of that stuff holding them back. Gotta respect it to some extent.\n\n I also understand that Oxford has more random and formal community building traditions and events especially at the beginning of the year.  Clearly size doesn't matter.  It is like a sizeable chunk of main campus students have to have \"formalized\" or wait for admin sponsored spaces for fun or else they have no clue what to do/assume nothing is happening. Apparently fun to them is taking a survey that says they are happy one day and then another claiming they are depressed within the same year lol.  I don't think folks should go get caught doing vandalism or anything, but they should loosen up a bit and get creative to make main a more interesting place socially.  \n\nYou can't constantly blame external forces for not particularly enjoying your social life (me and my friends were mostly STEM majors, even double majors and managed to figure out random stuff to do and figured out how to use the shuttles and MARTA to get to wherever we needed. Shoot, one year we tapped into our nerdy side and went to Dragoncon).  Sometimes reading little weird stories like that in the Wheel is a refreshing signal that says \"hey just college kids being college kids\" and makes Emory seem like a school with normal kids that just so happen to be high achieving.  Shit happens.",
