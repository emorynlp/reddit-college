      "text": "The credit hours are allegedly based on contact time per WEEK and not per semester.  Those research participation credits are distributed across the whole semester and many do not even exceed 30 minutes from what I remember.  For it to even be 4 hours, you'd need a required additional. component that was consistently about an hour a week (like primary lit and problem solving focuses discussion sections associated with some intermediate and upper division biology courses that occur weekly).  \n\nNow there is some weird stuff with how Emory allocates credit hours to things like labs and CWR courses but the research participation thing adding anything like even a credit (and certainly more) is pushing it.  I also think the participation in psych can be opted out of in favor of some alternative assignment which throws another wrench in the credit hour increase thing.",
