  "text": "Hello! I am a current incoming freshman. I currently have a roommate but I am also debating about just requesting a single instead. I understand that if you get a double, there is a chance of having a suite. Do most of the doubles have suites? Or is it very rare? Also, how bad are the communal bathrooms if you do not get a suite? I guess what I am asking is, is it worth not requesting a single to try and get a chance at a suite? Thanks!",

      "text": "The communal bathrooms are honestly not bad at all. They\u2019re kept clean and I never had to wait for a shower or anything. I\u2019ve honestly heard more complaints from those who are in suites because they\u2019re responsible for cleaning/stocking their own bathroom and someone doesn\u2019t pitch in. Suites are not overly-rare but they\u2019re certainly not the majority of double rooms.",

      "text": "The communal bathrooms aren't bad at all. They're very clean, new, and nice. I also came in to my freshman year really wanting a suite, but in the end it really didn't bother me one bit to use the communal restrooms. \n\nThere are fewer doubles with suites than normal doubles. It's hard to say the exact ratio, but there aren't many suites in freshman dorms at all. There are maybe a few in LSM and Raoul? Not sure. There definitely aren't any in Turman or Hamilton. No clue about Dobbs or Alabama. \n\nSophomore dorms have way more suites. Woodruff and Clifton are full of them, and Harris has a couple. \n\nI think living with a roommate in your freshman year roommate can be a beneficial experience, besides, you can only be upgraded from there. There are very few singles available to sophomores, so all the freshman who had singles because of covid all got a little spoiled because they now have to go from having their own room to having roommates. Additionally, as a freshman, it's nice to start out the year with a \"starter friend.\" Maybe you'll be in the same group of friends later on, maybe not, but either way it can't hurt.",
