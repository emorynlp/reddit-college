              "text": "I.think it's been a while since she taught a 141 section but she was an Abreu equivalent then except a tad more rigorous (not in a bad way.  She would do a few more exercises and give a couple of test items that test more meaningful learning which is good practice if you're pre-med).  I would ignore reviews for her 240 and 336 because 240 doesn't seem like her wheelhouse and she teaches 336 in a way students don't anticipate physiology to be taught (with a slightly bigger research emphasis vs. \"Here just memorize and regurgitate all this stuff!\") So is viewed as more intense than Cafferty and shepherd but it is likely.the ideal way to run a phys (vs an anatomy) course.",
