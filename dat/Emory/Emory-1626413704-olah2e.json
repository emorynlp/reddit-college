  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m an incoming freshman, and I\u2019m really interested in majoring in applied math and stats, but I\u2019m not sure if I should take intro to stat inference at the same time as intro to scientific methods in the fall. If I found the right checklist, it says stat inference isn\u2019t one of their major classes, so I was just wondering if I should take it because it could be helpful or etc or just don\u2019t worry about it. Thankssss",

      "text": "The two just aren't related(110 is basically a methods and research design course and 100 is a very basic but tedious intro. To stats course with a lab where you learn to do basic statistical analyses with R) and the other QTM cores will basically completely flesh out 100 as well as far more advanced statistical and computational methods using higher level math. I would not waste time on 100 unless you think you may pivot to a major that has it as a requirement.",
