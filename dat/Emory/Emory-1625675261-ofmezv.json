      "text": "I took CS 170 a few years ago, as a complete novice to coding (like you).\n\nThe class does not expect you to have any coding experience and will teach you everything from the ground up. But, the class is demanding and hard as they throw a lot at you at once and move very quickly. But it is totally doable. (Visit office hours after every class)\n\nOne thing I\u2019d recommend is to make sure your math skills are decent (the pre-business path will help you because that covers some math fundamentals). It\u2019s not a math heavy class, but I had some hiccups because my math background is poor. \n\nAnother piece of advice is to not get discouraged because a lot of students (at least when I took it) already know coding and take the class for an easy A. Just know that they\u2019re a small group and most other students are in the same boat as you with no background.",

      "text": "There's a class lower than CS 170 if you are interested in a more relaxed approach to it. I'll be quite frank, CS 170 is a great class to take but it is designed as a foundational class for people. You won't learn many practical things if your heart is set on business/finance (it will give you a good foundation to end up learning practical things though). \n\nBy all means, please explore. Maybe you'll even stick around with CS (pls do), just a heads up because I see lots of pre-b and premeds who expected something different in CS 170. It's hard to see how learning about recursion uses the stack in system memory can detect tumors or build iphone apps unless you see it through. All I'm saying is a CS minor ain't kill anybody",

I can't imagine it but maybe they'd certainly be better than completely useless on the coding side of things after it",

              "text": "I can actually speak to this because during CS 170, I went to my first hackathon with kids who knew way more than me. I was functionally useless, struggling to change colors on a webpage, and could not make anything I tried work. I ended up with quite literally nothing usable on my end and I didn't even end up learning anything. \n\nI'd say you can get to that point where you are able to move beyond pitch person in CS 171 when you learn object oriented programming (the bread and butter of the industry),. You can actually be useful and hold your own once you start pushing the 300 level electives. CS 370 (Software Engineering) is what most business majors want, but probably won't get.",

Getting buy-in to the former would definitely stimulate a new type of intellectual energy and capabilities on campus that don't otherwise exist as much as it could due to lack of engineering.   It seems like it is an untapped synergy among undergrads.  It would be intense, but for some reason Emory has types that are willing to engage that type of intense academic path (there is no way QSS could blow up if it weren't true).",

You\u2019re taking two polar opposite cultures and seeing if they can collaborate haha it\u2019ll be a wild ride",

          "text": "Just because a class is hard does not mean it requires background or that it is unfair/impossible to noobs. It just means that you should not go in with the pre-conception that because it is the 1st course, it'll be easy and I think that is the confusion of a lot of first years who take the first foundation level course in a STEM field. \"Well we're new so they have to give us some nice training wheels and go easy\" but instead they go:  \"Look, y'all are high achieving so y'all should know how to put in work. We won't be unfair, but you'll have to use that talent or work ethic that got you here to do well because later courses are going to expect a strong foundation\".  And they also know that many people don't have the work ethic from HS, so they have to sort of beat that and the needed independence into you using the intro. class.\n\nIt's very unusual to have intro STEM classes that don't give people a run for the money, especially if they haven't seen the content before but even many people who earn an A in the course will have worked consistently and used all or most of the resources whether they had experience or not.  The advantage will just be them having seen content before, but maybe they haven't dealt with the same problem types or level of exams in HS so even they can't relax.  Many who have no experience may also get an A or do well because they are unbiased and KNOW they need to work consistently to do well whereas some with experience may actually be complacent and get caught off guard or have a tendency to procratinate, etc.\n\nJust view it as: \"Look whether you have programming experience or not, you are at Emory so are NOT a dummy.  And you damned sure won't be dummy after this class\".  Unlike some teachers and courses, I guess classes like CS 170, math 111, chem 150/202, most psych 110 teachers, etc(exception: not too sure about bio 14x) believe in the capabilities (and willingness to learn) of Emory students, and that is nothing to fear.  Prove their beliefs right!",
