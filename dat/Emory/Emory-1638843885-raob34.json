  "text": "I haven't been having a great semester with my roommate. he comes in late at night very often, but is not quiet about it. also, I didn't know how much of a light sleeper I was until I roomed with him. there's plenty of other issues too, but let's just say he's pretty inconsiderate. i also realized how much I value my alone time. the entire roommate situation has affected my mental health a lot and even ruined my emory experience to the point of thinking of transferring. i've realized that i cannot live with a roommate in general.\n\nnext semester our schedules are completely incompatible. the room change period opens in january, but there's not going to be any singles, and the issue is that i don't want any roommates at all. i guess i could contact the department of accessibility services and tell them about my issues of mental health with rooming with someone and how it relates to the housing option thing, but I doubt that would be a strong enough reason for them to approve.\n\nlike actually what should I do because I've tried sucking it up and that obv didn't help lmao\n\nEdit: I actually got diagnosed with a mental health thing via psychiatrist on TimelyCare so I wouldn't be making anything up to DAS \u203c\ufe0f",

      "text": "It depends on your year since that determines how many rooms are available to transfer into. I'm assuming that you're either first or second since you want to transfer. For second years, I don't think I would get my hopes up, pretty sure Few and Evans are filled. You would have to ask yourself if you're okay living in a single suite in either Woodruff or Clifton, if they even have spots. As far as first year housing goes, I think that might be worse in terms of choice since the option of single suites is not a possibility. Singles really are only reserved for incredible need; that's pretty much what's said on the campus tour. You need a striking case tied to a health related accessibility issue to get placed in one, and I do not condone or suggest you invent one since that can land you in hot water. Your situation sounds painful and I am sorry that you have to go through it and I hope things work out for you, but I would probably suggest trying to find a different roommate.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, you probably won't get very far with accessibility services unless you have an external diagnosis for a severe mental disorder. You could always find someone who you think would be a better roommate and then approach the housing office together, as it's not unheard of for a whole room to open up. If that doesn't pan out, your odds of getting a more tolerable roommate in the lottery are probably high. My experience in general has been that most people are more tolerable than what you describe. Hope things turn out okay for you, that situation definitely sucks.",
