  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an incoming freshman and was wondering if I should bring a vacuum to campus. \n- Does emory provide a vacuum to share?\n- Do most people bring a vacuum?\n- If I should bring a vacuum, any recommendations on which vacuum I should buy? \n\nAlso... does the first floor kitchen have a refrigerator the whole building can share??\n\nThank you!!",

      "text": "Most res halls have a vacuum; when I was a student on main campus you would ask your RA and they would grab it. On Clairmont one year it was like that another they only lent at the start and end of the semesters? I was confused.\n\nIn any case enough people (probably \\~20%) had them so it was always easy to borrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfaik all the dorms that don't have kitchens in the apartment (aka main campus) have shared kithcens with shared refrigerators you can use. Which dorm will you be in and I can give more specific advice?",
