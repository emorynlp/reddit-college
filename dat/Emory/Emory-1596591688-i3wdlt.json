  "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI'm going online this year but as a new transfer student, I'm really confused about Emory's tuition and fee.\n\nIs the health and wellness fee included because I will take a PE class this fall? And the transcript fee is paid once or I have to pay $70 every year? Also, in the deposit, we paid for tuition deposit but that amount of money is not reflected either.\n\nI'd love to have someone breaks down the detail of the cost for me.\n\nThank you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uerikatx83f51.jpg?width=1097&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dcaa81cf66a164c857cb6191a4c1b86c22295c97",

      "text": "I\u2019m also doing remote learning this semester, and I asked about those fees to student financial services. Answers are as follow.\n\n\u201cThe Activity and Health and Wellness Fees are mandatory, University-wide fees charged to all students. The Activity Fee was charged and allocated by the Student Government Association \u2013 they have determined this amount is appropriate based on the programming they will administer this semester for both on-campus and remote learners.\n \nThe Health and Wellness funds are used for broader health programs which are available to all graduate and undergraduate students, regardless of where their studies are received. All students have access to services covered by this fee, whether in a remote or on-campus environment.\u201d",

Same with the $82 activity fee. Transcript fee was also $70 but I paid it once in Fall 2019 and never again.\n\n[Here are my charges for Fall 2020.](https://i.imgur.com/LFXMhtF.png)\n\nAs for your tuition deposit, I paid $150 and it showed up as a [payment and not a charge](https://i.imgur.com/5mmTuBe.png). Feel free to ask more questions.",
