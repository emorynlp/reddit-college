  "title:": "Emory Quantitative Sciences? Hardest Class MATH 210",
  "text": "I am MATH 210 right now, and I was on the QSS/Emory path. To be honest, this class is the hardest class I have ever taken, and it is making me question whether or not I want to continue doing this major. I heard that QTM 220 is even harder. Does anyone know what the hardest class in the department is and/or tips for passing MATH 210? I would love to know about other people's experiences with this class and their opinions on future QSS classes. Also, is doing QSS even worth it? If I work hard, will this major even pay off after college?",

      "text": "I'll let others answer with greater detail, but it is okay to struggle in a class or two especially when the class is intentionally tough (it would be one thing if the instructor was known to be \"easy\" and was so clearly watering content and assessments down and you were struggling).  Apparently 210 isn't just \"the class\" but the professor making it INTENTIONALLY challenging to train you well.  Also it being hosted in the math department spells a lower grade distribution.  There can be QTM core courses that are technically harder in terms of the content or because they employ stuff you learn in calculus or make you do a tough project, but I think grading is less stringent because ultimately QTM is geared towards social science majors and thus courses hosted by the dept grade as such (like a B/B+ mean, or B+ mean apparently).  Also, later classes, especially the electives are more focused/pointed so you can sort of choose by topic areas and skills you wanna learn.\n\nAlso, it is very likely to pay off even if you just make even a decent GPA as long as you LEARN enough from coursework to take advantage of all this stuff:  [https://sway.office.com/OKc29z9SxSQ8oSRi](https://sway.office.com/OKc29z9SxSQ8oSRi)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour goal is to position yourself well enough to do experiential learning via those oppurtunities and/or outside internships.  That is the way to maximize your outcomes.  It looks like the QTM dept with regards to UG education is trying to become an alternative to the b-school but for people willing to learn math and computing at some acceptable level.  They have rigorous courses, plentiful electives that contextualize data science, and lots of experiential opps and prof. development options. Keep your head up and do the best you can in this class and look forward to all of this stuff.  \n\nAlso, I'm assuming you are a sophomore saying \"this is the hardest class I've ever taken\" because if you are a freshman, that indeed is SUPPOSED to be the case. And hell, after COVID learning online and stuff, even as a sophomore, this year's version of coursework may feel extra intensive versus what you did at Emory last year.  But if you are a freshmen, don't doubt yourself.  Some of it really is \"STEM in college is just supposed to be harder than what I've done before\" because your reference point is K-12 and you're at a school supposedly catering to and pushing high achieving/well-prepared students.  Being pushed doesn't mean everyone always get an easy A or B.",
