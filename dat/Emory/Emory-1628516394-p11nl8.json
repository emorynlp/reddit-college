  "text": "Ox premed freshman here who stupidly didn\u2019t do the ALEKS chem thing and now I can\u2019t take chem unless there are spots in the shuffling stage. Bio \u201cisn\u2019t recommended\u201d for me because I never took AP bio, and physics isn\u2019t even available. What science can I even take at this point to satisfy some premed requirements? Am I screwed?",

      "text": "I didn\u2019t do the chem placement either because I want to take it second semester! Chem is definitely a second semester option so it\u2019s not like you wouldn\u2019t be able to take it for the entire year. As for bio, that\u2019s just a recommendation, right? So you could still try to enroll in a 101 class (that\u2019s something to ask your academic advisor about for sure!). Other than that, I know there are psychology, NBB, and environmental science classes available, some with labs, that\u2019s don\u2019t require placement for freshman. I\u2019m in incoming pre health freshman at ox as well so pm if you need anything else! \ud83d\udc97",
