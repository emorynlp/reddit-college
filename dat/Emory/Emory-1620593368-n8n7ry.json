  "text": "Hi guys! Incoming c/o 2025 here. I am doing a school project on the Emory Iberian Studies Program as a potential study abroad experience and was wondering if anyone who has any experience the program can give me a quick rundown of the specificexperiences and activities done while in Spain. I was looking at a link that I will include at the end of this paragraph that mentioned museum excursions and activities in a broad sense, rather than listing the exact activities which most likely changes annually. Here is the link btw: https://abroad.emory.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=1079",
