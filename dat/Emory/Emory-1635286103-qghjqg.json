  "text": "Hey guys! I was working on a personal project, and I realized that a lot of us experience trouble when finding mental health treatment. So this sparked my curiosity a bit. Personally, I know I\u2019ve experienced my fair share of roadblocks/barriers when looking for treatment or when seeing a therapist, so I was wondering if more people out there have had similar issues. Has anyone experienced any issues when seeking mental health treatment?  Would any of you guys be open to a quick zoom or phone call about the topic? It\u2019ll be completely anonymous, just looking to learn more about the struggles we encounter. Feel free to DM me!",
