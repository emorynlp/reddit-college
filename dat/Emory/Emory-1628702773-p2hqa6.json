  "text": "Approximately what percentage of freshman were remote during the 2020-2021 school year? Asking because fall 2021  will be the first time I will be on campus as a sophomore and I'm curious as to how many ppl are in the same boat as me. \nAlso concerned with how difficult it will be to make friends considering the circumstances.",

      "text": "In an info session someone said 65% of freshmen were going to be on campus first semester. I\u2019d assume that number jumped to 70-80ish percent second semester.\n\nHonestly you\u2019ll be fine though. I think it was hard for even the people on campus to make friends and I know people who struggled immensely to. That or only being able to make a handful of friends (2-3). There\u2019ll def be people who were on campus last sem that are willing to make new friends. And honestly, even if someone does already have a good amount of friends, I feel like very few people in that position would be opposed to making new ones.",

      "text": "I'm curious about the percentage just because that's an interesting statistics. \n\nI don't think that you should be concerned though. In my experience, freshman friends are not your long term friends. I've also found that the friends you have during periods of low capacity (like summers) are also not long term. This is because in both cases you end up being friends due to convenience. Not really shared interest. I'm sure you'll have no problems finding friends if you pursue your interests.",
