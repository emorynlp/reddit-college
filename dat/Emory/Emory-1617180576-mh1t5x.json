  "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI was recently admitted to Emory '25 and am currently looking into potential major/minor combinations.\n\nI'm leaning towards either:\n\n1. Computer science (BA major), BBA, mandarin minor\n2. Computer science (BA major), economics (BA major), mandarin (minor)\n3. BBA Dual degree with Georgia Tech engineering\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd be happy to hear about your experience with the workload/difficulty of the given subjects. Furthermore, would you suggest the combinations to be manageable?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "You can only have 2 academic \"concentrations\" so you could do 2 majors or 1 major + 1 minor, so options 1 and 2 are not allowed. You could do the required courses for another major/minor anyways but tbh that'd be very difficult to fit in along with gen ed grad requirement since the areas you're looking at don't have tons of overlap besides a few math classes. Never heard of anyone doing BBA + GA Tech engineering but just the sheer amount of courses required would likely take 6-7 years so you should consider if the disparate degrees is worth 2-3 years in lost earning potential. In line w/ 91210toATL, I don't find these academic tracks intuitive. Are you trying to hedge your bets as much as possible because you don't know what you want to do after college?",

There are many ways to learn useful stuff without majoring in them all.  You should also consider QTM. It has plenty of mathematical rigor to expose you to and some interesting interdisciplinary electives and teach different kinds of statistical programming.  There are many ways to learn useful stuff and get paid that don't trap you with stereotypical overly scheduled major combos.",

I think between the math/cs/econ departments, you can do this weird combined major of like math/econ that counts as a single major.\n\nBBA with GT dual degree would def not be possible within 5 years.
