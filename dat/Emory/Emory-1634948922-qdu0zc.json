  "text": "(well i am aware it's not really post-covid yet but you get my point)\n\nafter the past year i feel like it's kinda like, okay, i still can't make any friends, whatever, fuck it. and it's not like i don't want to make friends, but i literally don't know how, after having made none as a freshman even though i was on campus fall and spring. you get my point? i started out thinking it was just not having in-person classes and not having a roommate but it's clearly not that at this point.. i guess it doesn't help that i'm in like three massive stem lectures but anyways this was just a rant about how hard it is STILL, post-covid, to socialize, especially for the introverts of emory",

          "text": "This can def work but I feel like something better is just going up to ppl at DCT/Cox who are sitting by themselves and asking to eat with them. Really good way to meet new people imo. You do have to know how to approach people though and have pretty good social skills to consistently pull it off but honestly even if it\u2019s awkward I think it\u2019s a good practice.\n\nI think taking initiative at Emory when it comes to meeting people is super important & just getting good at approaching people. Like, no matter what you do, whether it be classes, volunteering, or clubs, not much will happen if you just wait for people to talk to you & ask you out to go on lunch. It might happen, sure, but if you want more success & a sure way to meet new people it\u2019s better to do everything yourself.",

'i wish it was this easy' means i wish it was that easy for making friends just to be a 1-2-3-repeat kinda thing, bc it really isnt lol",
