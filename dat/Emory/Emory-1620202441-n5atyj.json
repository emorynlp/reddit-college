  "text": "Hi all, prospective transfer student here! Could any transfer students tell me about their experience integrating into campus life? I'm coming from a small liberal arts school, where social life is very different. Did Emory offer any orientation programs etc. that connected you with other transfers? Did the transfer process feel isolating, or did you integrate relatively quickly? \n\nWhat are some things you love about Emory, and some things that you'd change (that question applies to everyone!)",
