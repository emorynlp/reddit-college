  "text": "Dues are $40, and while I technically have the money to pay it, I'm a low income student and will have to pay off college debt myself so $40 is a lot for me. The email said that people unable to pay can reach out to Phi Eta Sigma via their email, but does anyone know if that gives a reduced price or just an extension on the deadline?",

      "text": "Congrats on doing well academically as a freshman! However, realize that Phi Eta Sigma is basically paying to get validation in the form of a pin/cord. For some students, $40 is chump change, so  why not?  But no that in most meaningful way Phi Eta Sigma doesn't matter. You don't get worthwhile perks/benefits for membership and employers/Grad Schools/etc will not care at all. If you do well through college, you'll be invited to join departmental and overall honors societies that actually convey some benefits; save your cash for that\n\nNever hurts to ask if they'll waive the fee but if not, don't spend money that's signifcant to you.",
