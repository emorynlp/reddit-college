  "text": "Hello nurses/nursing students of Atlanta this message is directed towards the nurses that are looking for a side hustle,\n\nMy name is N\\_Uppal and I am a 33 year-old paraplegic,\n\nI live in Buckhead (Pharr Rd) and have an extremely active lifestyle.\n\nAs such the needs I have for nursing are unconventional, and varied;\n\n* Getting up at 6.30a is my preferred time (I really get up a 4, but doze for a few hours)\n* I need help transferring essentially independent beyond that\n* Love having conversations - I will befriend you\n* Meal prep  (my kitchen is laughably small)\n* fairly independent; however, I do need some basic nursing (SP Tube maintenance)\n\nHoping that any nurse, nursing alumnus of GSU, Emory, et al...responds and is interested.\n\n:)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Nursing students are in school/clinicals almost all day, every day.  You  \ndon't mention it specifically, but it sounds like you would need  \nassistance every day.  Is that correct?  I would clarify when you need  \nsomeone to be present, because a little help at 6 a.m. is different from  \nall day care.\"\n\n\\-Yes,  all week. Their schoolwork sounds like something that would enthrall me  if we talked about it. So nursing me may be beneficial beyond  monetarily! (academically too, leading to better exit opportunities from  school)\n\nI would clarify when you need someone to be present, because a little help at 6 a.m. is different from all day care.\n\n\\-  Agreed, my vagaries mislead the reader, a problem I had at work...  Ideally, a nurse for a few hours in the early-AM (times above)  for  stretching assistance, and transfer/dressing assistance (to save time  -  trying to keep clothes NOT wrinkled when dressing like a crip is not  really possible);\n\nIf you are posting for a job position, it is customary to mention pay  \nrange/benefits.  The way you've posted it here makes it seem like you  \nneed someone to work for you every day and you're offering nothing more  \nthan the experience of helping someone else for free, which, given the  \n\"overworked and burned out\" nature of being in a pandemic, is not  \nsomething most people are seeking.\n\n\\-  Wow, my lack of empathy is scary to me, this is exactly what I am  centering my budding political career on, your exposition of my careless  job-posting is...scary.\n\nYes, every morning, pay is negotiable, using market averages as a starting point.\n\nI would reach out to a home health nurse organization rather than  \nlooking for students, since that is their specialty and they're  \nlicensed.\n\n\\-  The bureaucratic mess and subtle complexities of companies DESIGNED to  deal with mentally handicapped people is incredibly frustrating meaning,  its not well laid out. Going to a used car lot in Daytona beach after  chain smoking a pack of Camels at 10am in a stained wife-beater  undershirt, swim trunks and flip-flops is LESS seedy than dealing with  these 'professional' agencies. I've called out street merchants in  Istanbul, Turkey for the hustle they tried to run on my fam and me. The  tortuous nature of various agencies' billing, additional expenses,  options, and extra services makes you feel less safe than in Istanbul,  negotiating the price of a bus trip to the Asian side of the city.\n\nPlus, I prefer direct-to-client payment, accounting will handle the taxes.",
