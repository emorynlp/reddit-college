  "text": "Hi! Class of \u201825 here! I\u2019m struggling to decide between Emory and Oxford. I like the smaller campus, smaller classes, and everything associated with that, but I just have a few questions about the transition to the Atlanta campus in junior year?\n\nIs it hard to integrate as a former Oxford student? Does it make it harder to gain leadership roles and research opportunities?",

      "text": "I'm honestly curious to see these answers. What I have seen is that Oxford folks (I had lots of Ox friends) tend to bring lots of friends with them so it makes the transition easier whether they wanna integrate or not. What I wanna read about is the leadership thing and peoples' experiences with that.  I would hope Oxtord students have an advantage because they did a lot of leadership development at Ox already but there could be the counterbalance of established social networks at ECAS that first have to be penetrated by an Oxford student.  I've always heard a mix of opinions on it.",

Watch what people say carefully.  I hope that they say Ox actually helped and that main networks were not a big barrier",
