  "title:": "[ADVICE] MPH Fall 2020: Admitted: Emory, University of Miami, CUNY School of Public Health, Charles Drew University, University of Texas Health Sciences Houston campus. IS EMORY WORTH THE $? HELP?",
  "text": "Hi!\n\nI hope everyone is doing well!\n\nI have been admitted to a majority of my MPH programs, Fall 2020 cohort. I am considering a dual degree in MPH/JD so I decided to apply to 3 schools that have that option (Emory, University of Miami, UTHealth Houston).\n\nI currently work and live in Los Angeles full time. I am from LA and I have been living at home for the past 6 months. I work at UCLA Health and I currently make around 50k a year. I am TERRIFIED of the tuition price at Emory and I was hoping I'd receive a need-based scholarship. I did not. I am a first-generation college student with no family assistance.\n\nFor background, I graduated from San Diego State with no loans. I've worked at both Kaiser San Diego and LA before moving to UCLA Health. I want to work in health policy on a legislative level (CDC or health law firms) which is why I am intrigued by the dual degree. I decided to go to a state school for undergrad because I knew I'd attend graduate school. Is Emory (ranked #5) worth the amount of debt I may collect or is going to a good value school UT Health Texas (#23), make more sense? Everyone at Emory continuously talks about the ample amount of opportunities and connections but I'd like to hear perspectives from students who have completed their MPH's. Did you make the right choice? Did you choose the big name/highly ranked school? Was the debt worth experience?\n\nI also received a 20k scholarship from University of Miami \\~(50k annually).\n\n**Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.**\n\n**Thank you! :)**",

      "text": "Since this is a graduate program I personally believe that rankings are very important for job prospects compared to undergrad. However, sit down and think about how long you it would take you to pay off your loans and think about if it\u2019s realistic. Because no ranking is worth crippling yourself with years and years of debt.",

      "text": "I went to Emory for my MPH and have worked at Emory since I graduated. It\u2019s a great program, but I would say it comes down to, what do you want to do? If it\u2019s work at CDC and/or EIS, then consider Emory. If you want to work at the state or local level, or HHS the debt is probably not worth it. If global health is your thing, look at Emory or Yale. If you\u2019re going for a PhD, don\u2019t go into debt now. I had a full ride at GSU and turned it down. Paying off Emory was hard and I sometimes regretted it. I definitely couldn\u2019t have made it work if my spouse hadn\u2019t been the main source of income. But I have my dream job now, who knows how it would have turned out otherwise. Probably ok though.\n\nWhat do you want to do with your MPH? What is your dream job?",

          "text": "Thank you for this!!\n\nMy dream job is definitely working within the CDC, it has been for a long time. I\u2019d like to work in health policy/national healthcare reform. This is why Emory was so appealing to me but upon acceptance I\u2019ve been really intimated by the tuition price. I didn\u2019t receive much aid besides loans and I am now trying to appeal my financial aid package and I hope it works in my favor. \n\nWas completing your degree quicker (1-1.5 years versus 2) an option? Was the course-load at Emory to vigorous to allow one to do so?\n\nAny advice would be great. \n\nThank you again!!",

                      "text": "I would ask if you can talk to students (former and current) from all 3 programs who have done/are doing HPM and/or HPM/JD. Get some perspective from those going through it and those who have done it and come out the other side. Emory is not the ONLY path to CDC, but proximity does help. People join their fellowships from programs all over. The money is a huge issue and you should not take that lightly unless you have serious back up (parents with substantial resources, spouse willing to support, etc). When do you have to decide? I do know some folks at the legal division of CDC - we worked on a paper for legal frameworks for NPHIs (basically CDCs around the world). If you want to DM me your credentials/interests/email, I'd be happy to connect you if you're interested in global work. You can also look up people who are doing what you want to be doing - most of them will be happy to answer a well written email asking advice. Happy to help with that too and just answer questions in general. It's a very anxious time deciding. I still remember making the decision - it was SO HARD and I had almost no guidance so I'm happy to help in any way.",
