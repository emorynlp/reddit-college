  "text": "Hello everyone! Im a prospective student going into my senior year of highschool and I desperately want in to Emory. I know my SAT score isnt quite up to par so I'm retaking it to get it higher. However, my GPA is 3.8 (on a 4 scale) and a 4.2 on a weighted scale. I've taken plenty of rigorous courses and I have a handful of extracurricular activities. Emory is my dream. I'd like to say I'm a good writer as well, my teachers have always said it's my super power.\n\nWhat's the best advice to help increase my chances?",

I applied with good essays, one that was specifically about Atlanta and what the city had meant to me (emory was my first choice mainly because of the location lol) and I explained in a lot of detail my background history. Writing about factors that made me different from others (physical, intellectually, etc) allowed them to get to know me.\n\nI applied regular decision, but after I sent in the application I updated Emory about more accomplishments, as I had won additional awards in competitive areas. So I think that demonstrated that I was committed to the school, and able to succeed academically.\n\nI think that writing the essays and allowing the admission officers to understand your personality and aspirations is the best way to get into Emory. Also keep in touch with the school about your progress, it shows dedication. Scores are good, but I don't think they'll hold much weight especially since emory is test optional.\n\nedit: I agree with the others, the teachers that wrote LORs knew me in detail, and I visited my counselors office a lot for random things.

My advice is to attempt questbridge since if you don't get chosen to be a finalist then you'll still have time to apply ED before the deadline. If you do make finalist and get matched with a school, even if it is not Emory, that is free college and you'll be happy anywhere without that debt.",
