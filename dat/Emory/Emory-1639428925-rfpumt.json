  "title:": "Any course that weighs finals VERY LITTLE?",
  "text": "After all this semester's finals, I found myself devastated, as courses with finals that weigh heavily just seem too hard. It's easier for me to gain participation credits, regular weekly homework/quizzes, and with no / a final that weighs \u226415 (or considerably less than 30%) of the total grade, and huge amounts of weekly tasks. Does anyone know of these courses in BIOL / CS department? And HSC / Language as well? Thanks! Also, for writing courses that assign huge amounts of paper and weigh each one very little is welcome, thanks!",

      "text": "Look eventually you are gonna have to learn how to deal.  Lots of jobs have big projects or giant important tasks that must be done well or else you don't advance, get reprimanded, or are fired (God forbid you wanna be a surgeon or something? How much do we weight someone's life?).  You're just gonna have to grow from this.  And most classes with many writing assignments also have at least one highly weighted writing assignment. And most classes that even have all those other components you desire weigh finals like 20-25% plus.  \n\nThe whole purpose of graded HW and other assignments is NOT just to help your grade but to give constant practice in hopes that you spend more time on material and retain the material.  It is exactly those types of classes that expect folks to be in solid shape for a final.  A class with all tests below 15% or all writing assignments below that is going to be hard to find because this isn't HS.  What you may want to do, if you can do it responsibly, is take courses with low or very spread out workloads to give you time to study or prepare for each milestone.  \n\nEither way, while college has lots of choice, some options may be rare and you'll need to give yourself time and put in effort to adjust to this paradigm.  It'll serve you well in the future. The fact is you weren't supposed to find Emory's mostly in person classes \"easy\"(maybe you are a sophomore or freshmen that got used to COVID reduced intensity courses, but most fall 2021 classes seem like \"normal\" or somewhere in between) and you may not be in a position to run towards the HS like scenarios.  Just figure out how you can manage this better in the futurem",

              "text": "Yeah I hate to be blunt like this because the worst times of COVID even made those courses feel challenging due to the effects on mental health and whatnot (probably because of isolation and monotony), but most courses, especially in STEM areas were, objectively not the same calibre as in person versions.  For example, while bio always had a significant graded workload, the exams and quizzes didn't have the types of averages you saw during COVID because paper exams don't come with technological constraints to developing test items that test deeper learning or problem solving (I heard that Canvas often struggled to load figures so many faculty were gonna avoid the headache of giving items that rely on a figure in favor of standard word problems or just content recall oriented problems).  You had gen. Chem basically go multiple choice (like 1-2 very simple FRQs per exam vs. Like 60% of the test being that even in an easier year). Chem 203 and 204 also migrated to mostly MCQs and avoided having as many thought provoking items.  \n\nEither way, yeah in person is requiring an adjustment for many or most because weighting is going back to normal, assessments are objectively more intense, and grading norms (final grade distributions) are less \"compassion based\". But don't worry, you'll adjust and the sooner the better.  Running away from it for now might not be helpful because you can't avoid these scenarios in STEM (or even outside of it) and whether you are pre-med, pre-grad, pre-job, or pre-life, you want to finish strong and not have declining grades as even more classes revert to the norm.",

      "text": "90% of the time you either have to choose writing/reading a lot or doing STEM practice problems + exams. That being said, my psych class next semester has only one exam that\u2019s worth 20% and participation counting as 25%, but I had to ask for permission to enroll. I also only found out about this after I did \u2014 I wanted to sign up for the class just because I thought it was really interesting.\n\nIf you want a super easy class, check RMP and gauge class descriptions. Email professors for syllabi. Humanities courses will be easier (I think soc and WGS tend to be the lightest). If I were you, I would expect to actually have to work in college though.",

      "text": "Lol. Ok, I\u2019m going to act like this isn\u2019t a troll. \n\nIt\u2019s college. Every class is going to be too hard. If you don\u2019t have a final, you have a project or a paper or something else awful. That said:\n\nMy CS 253 class didn\u2019t have a final, just a final project. But the homework and midterms were as difficult as you\u2019d expect. \n\nNo course in the English/Creative Writing departments is going to have any tests (unless you get really unlucky) but they do have final papers. These can be brutal if you put them off. The more history/philosophy/religion-based HSC\u2019s are also going to have a lot of papers rather than finals, but memorization classes like anthro and Econ will have finals. \n\nTypically though, every CS class at Emory is going to have some sort of final and it\u2019s going to be worth 30-50% of your grade. The good thing about CS is the other half of your grade is going to be homework, which you can spend as much time as you need on. \n\nDon\u2019t know much about those others, it really depends on the language and level.",
