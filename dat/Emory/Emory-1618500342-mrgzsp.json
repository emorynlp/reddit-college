  "text": "Hi, looking for advice on college pick. I am left with UGA and Emory with full tuition after several rejections and few waitlists. I got UGA honors and some other merit scholarship. I am planning to pursue pre-med, however wanted to see how that goes and transfer to a different major. I didn't get any financial aid or merit scholarship from Emory. Have a hard time deciding. I would appreciate any input on this.",

      "text": "This reads as salty, because the part about rejections and waitlists didn't have to be said.  You must not feel good about Emory, and financially it makes no sense.  Go to UGA.  It actually has pretty strong STEM curricula, especially for the pre-health crowd (if you can get access to some of the undergraduate pharmacy courses there, do it!).  I think Emory has better support services and smaller, more \"interesting\", gateway STEM courses but it isn't worth paying full tuition vs. paying virtually nothing at UGA.  Go work hard, have fun, and apply to medical school.  If you don't like UGA, maybe apply to the schools that waitlisted or denied you that you actually like IF they have a reasonable transfer in rate.",

No school pride, never wore Emory t-shirts, etc. Best advice is to go to a school you want to be at. Otherwise, pick the most suitable public university so you won't be paying a fortune for something you don't want.",

      "text": "For what it's worth, pre-med is not a major, but rather a set curriculum that prepares you for entry to medical school. Your major is a separate decision/set of courses from your pre-med courses (obviously with some overlap if you decide to do a hard science major). \n\nAs for UGA vs Emory, they are very different schools, but you can be academically rigorous at both, and I've had plenty of friends make it to med school from both. In your shoes, unless money is no object or you have a very strong preference, I would strongly consider going to the school that will cost less. If you make it to med school, that will already cost plenty, and you don't want to have to juggle both sets of loans if you can avoid it.",
