  "text": "Hey! This might be a dumb question but I figured it was worth a shot. I got my financial aid last week and it is a bit on the expensive side. I would have to pay about 30k. I have an offer from Washington and Lee that would allow me to pay about 17k a year.  I've seen some responses to similar posts stating that you can use other offers to negotiate financial aid, but Emory's appeal instructions state that they will not consider that. I don't really have any special circumstances, either. Should I try anyway? Has anyone had any success with doing so?",
