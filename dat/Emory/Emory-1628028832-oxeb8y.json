  "text": "I see lots of people stacking their classes. Mine feels like there's an awkward amount of time between each of them. Is this fine for now?\n\nThis is aiming towards a start on the introductory path for a bio major aiming for pre-med. Hopefully, this is not too little.\n\nAlso, regarding online classes, do most people just join from their laptops at the library or in their dorms? Or, is there a designated place that people join from?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/etoeaawvv7f71.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=61c48885b640519b2eebecc4d1b6afe536baf689",

Like bio can be quite strict with that and you can tell they are serious by how they make AP folks take 141-L. Also, don't take math 111 online. Possible they won't even allow you to do that (may be reserved for those not going to campus) so plan on another section if you keep it (not sure I recommend you keep it tbh.  Chem and it may be a challenge along with bio being a little thorn on the side. Given how light the rest of the schedule it is, it may be doable for sure though if you say...drop English before adding the labs for chem and bio)",

How many credits would that be? 15 or 16?\n\nEdit: If you feel a bit squeamish when you get the syllabi/go to your classes, you can also consider QTM 100 (after dropping English depending on how many credits you have left). It'll be a bit \"busy\" (graded workload heavy) but less complex (problems, content, and assignments are more straight-forward and comparable to book/practice probs) math class.  I also hear that the math 111 exams are on the more challenging side whereas QTM 100 is pretty much: \"You keep up and practice, you probably do well\".  That way you can sort of feel out what a somewhat rigorous STEM courseload is like without overwhelming yourself. You can save calc. for sophomore or junior year unless you wanna consider pivoting in a more quant. bio direction (bio now offers several electives that benefit from at least calc. 1) in the future.",
