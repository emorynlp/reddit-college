      "text": "Like others have said, if you are planning to take Chem 150 it is required that you complete the ECCP. It is worth 3% of your final course grade. That said, the summer work is only graded based on compleition. As long as you finish your pie (should say 100%), you shoule be good. \n\nHere's a link to the ECCP website: http://chemistry.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/student-support.html. It should help answer any of your questions. If you are still unsure about something, I would reach out to the department for additional clarification.",

      "text": "Rising senior here. If you need to take chemistry, you will need to complete ECCP. Need the pie chart to show 100% (that is, have no leftover \u201clearned\u201d sections and only have \u201cmastered\u201d sections). Don\u2019t be like me and not complete it and be unable to register for chemistry for a whole semester. \n\nMaybe you can retake the test \u2014 not sure on that. But you definitely should finish the ECCP if you want to take chemistry at Emory. \n\nIt\u2019s been around 3 years since I\u2019ve had to do stuff with ECCP, so your best bet on getting up-to-date info is to email a pre-med advisor. You can find their emails on the Emory Prehealth website. Hope that helps!",

      "text": "If you plan on taking CHEM 150 in the fall, you must complete the ECCP on aleks. Not only is the information important, but it\u2019s also worth a part of your grade in the class (I believe like 3-5%). You take a baseline test in the beginning and then it makes you review all the topics you missed until your pie is full. Once it\u2019s full, you\u2019re done!\n\nDo NOT procrastinate this, especially if your background in chemistry is weak. It can take forever and there\u2019s no way to speed through it\u2026I\u2019m a huge procrastinator and aleks is the one thing I\u2019d never put off because you can\u2019t cram it all in at once. Do a little bit everyday.",
