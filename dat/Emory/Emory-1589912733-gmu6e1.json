  "title:": "To future or current Emory students considering non-professional STEM (or other) graduate schools",
  "text": "Please stop obsessing over a SINGLE component of your application.  I have been seeing this obsession over whether or not a major/some courses will be \"hard\" because you likely want to be overly protective of your GPA (people seem to literally be acting as if keeping near a 4.0 is critical for successful access to whatever). I have also seen weird complaints about certain (STEM) what are otherwise good teachers because of their testing formats and stuff (like I have seen: \"such and such asks convoluted questions\"..\"such and such has exams whose items are too open ended\"....uhm, these teachers are prepping you for the reality and ambiguity or complexity that often is actually in science.The complexity and ambiguity that, especially intro textbooks, hide from you. Why did you come to a school at Emory's level if you wanted simplicity in your STEM courses of all things?  These schools are supposed to give you an advantage by assuming you are talented and smart enough for them to be able to show you the additional complexity and also give you more complex demands than you would get from so called \"lesser\" schools.  Don't get mad at the instructors who actually try to do that unless they are obviously just complete garbage and don't care for students at all.  I mean, were the admissions officers wrong in admitting you?  Did y'all fake your GPA, class rank, SAT scores, or some sports affiliation like what happened at USC? I doubt it, and seriously hope not).\n\nI digress: Usually PhD programs are NOT looking for academic perfection or whether you are a perfect \"student\".  They want to see your potential to develop into a SCHOLAR (very different from being a good student, trust me), and that involves doing research or engaging in experiential oppurtunities in your area of interest and looking at your department/major as an oppurtunity to fully develop your skills and passions at a very DEEP and serious level (your goal is not to present a perfect piece of paper in the form of a transcript.  Believe it or not, most of your professors, including those who are younger and attended top and well-funded programs in their discipline, did not have anywhere near perfect grades.  Some of them certainly did, but most were just passionate and already solid in research or very intellectually immersed in the area they applied to), so it isn't about your ability to take some courses and show you aced them.\n\nAdmittedly GPA becomes more important for fellowship (especially national) and grant considerations, but 3.5+ or 3.7+ from undergrad plus research prowess/great writing and experimental design/experimental reasoning skills (they rate the grant itself and not just your CV/resume and transcript and the grant has to be usually in a solidly high percentile to be considered for funding) will get you in the door for that.   Either way, do not avoid risks to hold on to a 4.0.  You should take several classes that help you PREPARE for what you'll encounter in graduate school which will be very open ended challenges, and bluntly, a lot of failure and improvization (do not view Emory or anywhere you end up as merely a stepping stone to a PhD or MS program where you just \"gotta get through Emory unscathed\".  The reality is that these programs require resilience and still have fairly high attrition unlike professional schools which are very structured and ensure basically everyone gets through if they just do as told.  Research success is rarely based on obedience).  Get yourself ready for being uncomfortable or dealing with unpredictable situations and outcomes in research/being able to trouble shoot.  It usually won't be about getting a \"right\" answer but asking the right questions and crafting viable strategies and approaches to ask those questions and get some information that leads to some of insight. Preserving your ego/ideas of perfection/genious by taking extremely predictable or easy courses in your field can set you up for some very uncomfortable moments in graduate school.\n\nI am a biochemistry PhD candidate, and I can tell you fellow life sciences (and chemistry) folks that consider graduate school or MDPhDs that you will often discover things yourself or through reading the literature that things that were presented in your more textbook/regurgitate the details oriented courses as a very incomplete and maybe incorrect description of what is actually happening.  And hopefully you have the thrill of finding this out during undergraduate research opps if you engage them.  But either way, don't get comfortable and think you know life sciences/biology because you made A's in your regurgitation oriented classes.  It means very little in the long term if you aim to actually do science in a field.  It is why I stress taking more courses that focus on learning techniques and research approaches to ask and answer questions in a field vs. just learning raw content.  You may initially worry that if you take a less traditional instructor who focuses on the former that: \"But then I won't know the traditional things a student is supposed to learn from those classes and I may not make an A\". As long as you can get a B+ and befriend that professor (I've said it over and over again.  Usually these professors KNOW they are different from others so will write great rec. letters for students that show a high level of engagement or passion even if they do not make an A grade.  They can also help get you recruited to a lab.  People like Eisen are notorious for leveraging his contacts to set people up with research opps), you'll be okay, and you'll thank yourself later for learning how to think independently and experimentally in a sub-field of biology.  Google is for the details (you'll likely forget crap like the Krebs cycle and bunches of other pathways that \"less good\" professors made you regurgitate or tested very specifically about, but mostly failed to emphasize any problem solving, cases, experimental scenarios, or techniques that allow scientists to learn about those pathways).\n\nThis isn't high school or AP. It is less about getting a \"right\" answer like much of your undergraduate course work may do (at least if you just flippantly choose courses and instructors to check off requirements), so much as asking the right questions and finding viable approaches to getting some information that helps answer those questions.\n\nAnother important thing for chemistry/life sciences oriented folks.  If you can, please take some more interdisciplinary STEM courses perhaps hosted by departments that you aren't as comfortable/well-acquainted with because the future of life sciences research IS interdisciplinary (like my lab uses several techniques whose full understanding requires knowledge of many STEM disciplines as well as computational because we do a lot of structural biology).  And unfortunately many biological sciences undergraduate programs have not shifted to reflect this so you'll have to put in effort to find courses and professors that provide the oppurtunity to learn this way.  Fortunately, Emory is getting stronger and stronger in terms of quantitative bio options and undergraduate courses, and you can also take key elective courses in chemistry and/or physics that may give you good exposure.\n\nYou'll find that most top tier and universities with well-funded life sciences departments are moving towards an \"Integrated/Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences\" entry pathways for prospective students to apply to, and usually the core coursework WILL include courses that you either dodged for whatever reason or didn't think to take as an undergraduate: things like biophysical chemistry, chemical biology, or a more experimentally focused biochemistry course, a course specifically covering protein or nucleic acid chemistry, genetic engineering, etc.  Emory has undergraduate courses that would easily mirror or prep for them.  You should at least try some of them.  If you are social sciences, getting a better quantitative background and good experiences that let you apply methods in your field (via course-based research projects or co-curricular opps) will ready you best.  If humanities, learning how to do archival research will probably help most.\n\nEither way, I want to leave this video which describes what grad school committees look for, and it is SUPER holistic (it is easy to find ways to compensate for \"weaker\" parts of your application.  And again, please don't consider a non-3.8-4.0 GPA or something as a \"weakness\".  It just isn't in the context of the admissions part):\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\\_continue=1429&v=zW\\_36e50xMk&feature=emb\\_logo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1429&v=zW_36e50xMk&feature=emb_logo)\n\n\\*Note that if you are STEM in particular, they usually give students at more selective LACs and research Us (that includes Emory of course) somewhat of a break on GPA expectations especially if there is evidence that you took plenty of relevant (do target much of your course selection to your research or departmental interests if you can, especially in junior/senior year) upper divisions (or a couple of grad. courses) and challenged yourself.  Again, very high GPAs and near \"perfection\" will make you a better candidate for fellowships, but don't craft your schedule and level of effort you want to put in with that in mind.  As I like to say to many: \"Learn as much as you can\" (you will benefit from retaining as much knowledge and skills as possible.  During my rotation year, I was able to focus on my research rotations and less on getting the grades in my core course work because I was already adjusted to what type and level of thinking graduate courses required.  I didn't have to learn how to \"properly\" learn biological sciences like a lot of my peers from elsewhere admitted they had to simply because they never took life sciences courses that required more than just memorization/basic level applications and understanding.  In addition, many were not used to being thrown a curveball, more complex than average, tedious question or several on an exam, which is kind of just like what doing science is like, so please, especially freshman, spare professors who do this the bad reviews.  They are doing a favor.  At the worst, you'll just benefit from a curve anyway, so there is literally no harm done trying to see if you can stretch your thinking a little bit.  View it as \"learning improvization\".  You'll need that. A purely \"straight-forward\" STEM assessment isn't realistic/representative of reality, but it sure makes us feel great! Believe me I get it, but you should also take pride when you are able to solve the highest or higher level questions in those settings.  It means you really learned the material.  Not that the teacher made everyone feel good with a test with 85+ average and thus tricked everyone into thinking they learned because they only gave you the simpler/extremely predictable items in the first place). This involves taking the classes that build the right type of thinking skills, have a good (and perhaps quite challenging) instructor, and then leveraging the skills gained from those to actually DO science and engage in a project/research, or other professional development activity that immerses yourself in your area of interest.\n\nI've been doing this type of advice for years (it is basically nothing short of trying to change the mindset of many prospective students and younger undergraduates who tend to see their academic decisions in the most short-sighted way.  Most of us have been there, trust me), especially in an Emory context, but feel free to ask questions about this and about any Emory courses/professors (I'm older, but apparently most of the same professors are STILL at Emory and teach roughly the same way. Things like that often do not change.  There are also current students who likely took these people that I am certain would never mind sharing their experience or what they got or didn't get from them) you should or can take or should avoid if you are considering a research heavy career.  I can give my take on many different professors and \"types\" of courses that I really think all(but especially research bound: future PhD and MDPhD candidates)  STEM UGs and particular should be taking (even the pre-meds. While much of med. school is apparently some form of applied memorization, you still must take the MCAT which heavily emphasizes the typical scientific reasoning skills and competencies that even an aspiring research scientist would need.  From what I have seen and heard, it looks extremely similar to GRE biology and biochemistry subject tests in terms of the types of questions it asks....and they aren't just simple \"high school one liner multiple choice questions\" for the most part, so don't get mad at say, bio instructors who give the types of tests which usually only contain a few of such items anyway) often lambasted by students that I mentioned in the beginning.  These professors are just doing what they are supposed to and trying to prime students for standardized tests FULL of similar styled items.  These teachers aren't your enemy/adversary, so honestly thank them for even trying to think of your long-term success instead providing immediate gratification.",

                  "text": "I think it is available in a LOT of places but from what I am seeing, people are not actually looking into this stuff seriously. \n\n I think most don't and are just assuming that Emory or wherever is HS 2.0 and that the same superficial stuff a lot of them did to get into Emory will serve them well for something like grad. school (believe me, I get this is somewhat the case for prof. school, but even there, Emory has some data on Law School placement that suggests that the premium placed on keeping a 3.9- 4.0 vs a \"generally high\" GPA is vastly over-rated.  In fact it is clear that some T14s seem to be more lenient on Emory GPAs because it takes a lower GPA to achieve high LSATs. Appears they mainly want the LSAT. Some of the admitted Emory student cohort to a couple of them had below median or even 25% GPAs a bit below 3.7! Northwestern was such a case) as if it is merely about \"getting into\" grad. school like it is for college or prof. school.  \n\nNah, you have to survive and try to thrive in it. I've seen tons who looked golden on paper from UG struggle through(and were even dismissed) all components of capstones or prelims and whatnot because the skills and perserverance needed to handle them were under-developed likely because they spent too much time crafting the appearance of perfection and readiness vs actually getting ready. Folks should find some way to optimize all of this.\n\nAlso I think many law schools still use curves and release ranks of students, so they wanna go and perform well (especially given how a lot of those jobs have dried up or have deteriorated in compensation)",

It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t learn a good amount through regular classes. Take Calculus, for example. It\u2019s not even on the MCAT at all, and it\u2019s not essential to my profession. Why then should I study it under a difficult professor if I could devote more time to studying things that are much more important to me?",

          "text": "Depending on your goals....mix and match the courses.  I have a mentee who maintained a 3.85+ while taking a courseload such that he got at least one B grade every semester after freshman year (he got all A/A- freshman year and got some freedom because he already took ochem and bio as freshmen).  He usually made the \"risk\" course something in a non-STEM dept to say, develop writing skills (he took Morey in English for example), and sometimes a STEM with a tough instructor or grad. course.  He made it into numerous MDPhD programs and chose Pitt.   Other MD only students who had 3.75+ and applied similar strategies or just chose whoever was \"good\" for a course, whether they were hard or not experienced \"added value\" effects on the MCAT (they usually got 37+ on the 2015 MCAT which was piloted and had not changed to the new scale yet) so were also interviewed everywhere they applied (once interviewed, luck plays a role).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*You're right:  Calculus is not on the MCAT, but also, calculus is apparently standardized at Emory now, and it ain't easy for most anymore (and math 116 will be a bear for most who have to take it).  Choose the best lecturer in that case and not the section that will do poorly on the exams due to bad teaching.\n\nDefinitely prioritize strong life science courses.  And believe it or not, some people like Gerardo and Beck have like B+ or B/B+ averages while giving what I consider \"good\" tests that prep for the MCAT or science in general.  Those are high averages, and you learn a lot.  So you can mix with courses like that and place 1-2 instructors in where the median/average grade is a tad lower on average (the reason they have B+ ish averages is because their courses grades don't ride only on exams, so you can look for other courses like that too.  Generally they do help you get a better grade AND learn more.  Because sometimes high stakes exams are not the best for assessing higher-ordered learning due to time constraints and length.  Nonetheless, students should learn to take harder than average exams in a timed setting.  This is why Eisen, Weinschenks, and Sorias have an added value effect.  I think Spell has this for courses like genetics too.  Then there are courses with NO exams that could be very helpful and yield decently high grades while teaching you to think).\n\nAlso, I actually DON'T think some of the \"regular\" STEM courses are that good. Can you define \"regular\" for me please?  Again, the goal is to retain the material and be able to APPLY and problem solve in unfamiliar scenarios.  If those courses (in say, the life sciences) don't ever demand that, they aren't particularly good IMO.  Also, those skills are transferrable across disciplines (like experiencing it in Calculus can teach you or get you used to it elsewhere.  Not a big deal.  The more experience with it you get, the better you progress with it.  Taking Soria and Spell for ochem and bio really helped that mentee transition nicely to other more \"open ended\" professors such that he made mostly A's).",

Kind of worried about sophomore year, because it seems like I\u2019ll have to take ochem and biochem in the same semester. \n\nAnd Emory\u2019s kind of weird too. I think other schools have 2 semesters intro chem + 1 semester of ochem and 1 semester of biochem. Emory somehow wants us to do 5? I think usually at other schools you do something like take ochem over the summer. Don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to work out. \n\nI might try and take bio over the summer of my freshman year. It seems like a bad idea, but I don\u2019t know, the prospect of taking a class under Spell and Weinschenk in the same semester seems scary.

                  "text": "Spell and Weinschenk together shouldn't be much of a problem.  What people don't tell you is that the bio curric. is much easier now, and Spell would likely teach 142 (and not 141) which would align with chem 204 which is no doubt easier for most than any 203 professor (Weinschenk gives sort of a standard 204 course and the tests are less weighted towards any sort of applications in comparison to 203). People keep saying Spell is hard, but I think her test averages were always in the low-mid 80s (I don't get students expectations.  Do they expect 90+ average or 85+?  Those are EXTREMELY high and indicate a flat out easy course which shouldn't be expected in STEM at Emory or really anywhere.  I generally regard, below 70 as \"hard\" and those who give exams like 75 average and up as \"doable\" with 71-80 being sort of \"medium\") like the other sections suggesting her relative teaching effectiveness and that making an A/A- is as doable as it is in other sections (plus, there are lots of quizzes, Mastering Bio, and take-home assignments and stuff. Can somebody who recently took her or biol 142 tell how this works now).  I mean...80 something test average  means \"very doable\".  And the course average had to be higher because I am sure averages on other things were higher than the exams.\n\nBiochem is a relative joke!  And no, that isn't how that works, not at peers and research universities at least (LACs are known for other sequencing, like 1 semester gchem, 2 semesters organic, and then one biochem.  Emory is like a hybrid between what many LACs do and what most research Us do.  It just blends organic into the first year gchem sequence, has a full organic chemistry course 3rd semester, and then a \"macromolecules\" which is like materials ochem and biological chemistry concepts/chemistry in the 4th semester).  Most elswhere (other research Us) take gchem first year, 2 semesters ochem 2nd year , and biochem some time before the MCAT.  I honestly would not rush biochem (I know some who didn't take it prior to MCAT and scored well, and others who took bchem 1, and did fine but still ran into a lot of surprises on it that bchem 1 didn't emphasize and at that point they were relying more on the \"think my way out of a box\" skills they gained from the Weinschenks, Spells, Eisens, etc than actual biochemistry knowledge to save themselves).  Like physiology, it is helpful\"ish\" for the MCAT, but is over-rated due to being so memorization heavy (so if you somehow retain all the content, you may be able to more easily answer the few non-passage based MCAT prompts, but won't be as prepped for passages) and less problem solving oriented (MCAT seems like much more of a mixture with a bias towards the aspects that can be tested through problem solving and experimental scenarios) at Emory and really most schools (peer or not) in the hands of most of the faculty teaching it (I think Escobar \"tries\" sometimes.  Maybe u/phraps has insight here) except maybe the chemistry rendition.  This likely comes from a history of bchem 1 sequences being more aligned with actual clinical/med. school biochemistry modules which just emphasize the pathways/details and them staying that way even after \"biochemistry\" that emphasized a lot of other things was introduced to the MCAT (one mentee of mine actually said his MCAT had a passage on the types of BIOPHYSICAL experiments on proteins done in my lab, for example.  I'm sorry, but a typical biochem 1 course won't prep you for that sort of thing).\n\nI honestly think things like genetics and Eisen's cell in conjunction with biochem 1 exposure are better prep. Also, keep in mind that 204 (it isn't fully an organic course, 203 is) covers some of the key concepts that will also be covered that will be covered in biochem so those two reinforce each other best.  If you can take 204 with bchem, you'll likely be okay.  I wouldn't rush to take it with 203 (Instead take a Weinschenk or Soria and do something else with the biochem slot.  Could be an easy STEM/non-STEM class or could be a medium/challenging but useful and doable STEM class)\n\n\n\n*Also, I need to make this clear.  When I say \"challenge\", I am not referring only to grading (there are lower grading courses that are NOT particularly challenging at all.  For example, an intro. biology teacher that throws huge volumes of content and then  tests the most obscure facts and details is probably just as likely to yield a lower average as one who tests more applications.  The first group wasn't challenged to learn in any meaningful and lasting way).  That is the first thing that comes to everybody's mind.  I am referring to this: [https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/)\n\nI am saying students should try to take courses that emphasize getting students to do stuff between the middle and top of the pyramid/taxonomy vs. the lower half.  The reason I bring up grades is because I know many are worried about getting lower grades for trying this because most Emory/high achieving students are very comfortable with and have mastered learning at the lower half of it before coming to Emory.  And typically k-12 biology emphasizes that lower half (a lot of non-AP instructors won't even demand applications/level 3, and many AP classes will overly coach their students to handle the specific applications on the AP exam to a point), so it can be quite an adjustment for many who experience an instructor(s) who demand level 3 in biology courses (biology and neuroscience are stereotyped rightly or wrongly as being about memorization) and certainly higher.\n\nSome professors who do this, even in intermediate courses may indeed fall in the B-/B or B- sort of average, but some will be higher depending on how their syllabus is structured As you go up, they'll become less dependent on tests anyway, so if you take an Eisen or a Spell and make that B or B+ because you couldn't get used to the tests which may test more on experiments or have lots of Free Response/data analysis, you can pad your GPA AND keep honing those higher ordered skills with upper division courses that don't have or are less weighted by high stakes exams (maybe they'll have p-sets, reading, writing, or other types of assignments that can be worked on in groups and are typically graded less stringently).  There are ways to have cake and eat it too, and you'll get the increasing GPA trend as a result.",

      "text": "Since showing is better than telling (some people may need to know what sample MCAT could look like or what life sciences STEM coursework or expectations could look like. I clearly write/wrote too much), here are some things I usually post on here along with some other stuff:\n\nHere is the old 2015 MCAT preview guide. Some sample passages and stuff start on like page 70 or so: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B456FmeCw42Bc3J6c2JSeVJHNTA/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B456FmeCw42Bc3J6c2JSeVJHNTA/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHere is another more recent I think (online in AAMC website. They have a bunch of other stuff that you might wanna look at):\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAfbWX\\_HK-eoqJLjUV8IGkWZgKkSmcst/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SAfbWX_HK-eoqJLjUV8IGkWZgKkSmcst/view?usp=sharing)\n\nHere are GRE subject tests (they may have retired biochem, but biology is still around):\n\nbiochemistry (note, for those of you who took and complained about \"convoluted\" biol 141/2 questions. Look at the last set of questions. Hell, the section before the explicitly experimental section is rough too and has long questions with long answers that require some mixture of foundational knowledge and critical thinking, as well as an ability to sift through necessary vs. unneccessary information. Welcome to science!):\n\n[https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice\\_book\\_biochem.pdf](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_biochem.pdf)\n\nbiology (very similar but more of a focus on ecology and evolution):\n\n[https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice\\_book\\_biology.pdf](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_biology.pdf)\n\nI'm sorry, but if you are at Emory and take a bunch of biology courses and they had MCQs or Free response sections that never asked these types or styles of the higher ordered questions among these (I actually know for a fact that Spell and several instructors would actually ask the same questions as seen in the biology subject tests on bio 142 exams, especially the prokaryotic genetics focused/more experimental questions), then they weren't good and you weren't getting particularly good training.  If you plan to only take those types, take your parents' or whatever donors' (whoever is covering your scholarships/need aid grants, etc) money and just light all of it on fire or throw it in a well because you could have saved money going elsewhere to be less ready for key standardized exams or whatever you'll face in graduate school.\n\nNote that people who have taken AP biology should be more ready for this style of tests and thinking: [https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap18-frq-biology.pdf](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap18-frq-biology.pdf)\n\nThis has the right idea, but requires less specific knowledge of experimental techniques and how \"raw\" data from an experiment would look like, but is a very good start and people who took such AP (or IB) courses, should not fear taking a more \"challenging\" biol 142 instructor or adapting to more challenging intermediate/upper division instructors. You already have exposure to the type of learning and tests I refer to.\n\nFurthermore, Emory's GDBBS program has these written (part 1) pre-lim exams posted and while many other biological sciences programs no longer do them (They instead have replaced it with only a mock grant write-up and defense), they are representative of what a lot of your core courses in a graduate program will demand of you and how exams or problem sets may be written in those courses. If you haven't been exposed to some at least \"lite\" version of it in undergrad, it won't be a pretty (notice the emphasis on data analysis, the complexity of the scenarios, and some prompts asking you to design SEVERAL experiments to test a hypothesis and they tell you to draw out expected results and name controls, etc. There are some professors who will get you some exposure to this type of thing, and others who will just tell you to know and regurgitate the slides, the book, or some combo of the two. No problem solving required) transition and you will be more worried about coursework when you should be worried about your research rotations:\n\n[http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM\\_SITES/BCDB/documents/qualifying-exams/2018QE.pdf](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/BCDB/documents/qualifying-exams/2018QE.pdf)\n\nAnd they have a whole database with the other years too:\n\n[http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM\\_SITES/BCDB/resources/quals.html](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/BCDB/resources/quals.html)\n\nAnd here are some of the main foundational coursework that 1st and 2nd years would do at Emory (again, usually most other programs are much more interdisciplinary and \"involved\" but these components are there too): [http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM\\_SITES/BCDB/academics/curriculum/coursework.html#grants](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/BCDB/academics/curriculum/coursework.html#grants)\n\nThis is a completely different style vs. half of the undergraduate courses offered at Emory, but again, that means like half are options that mirror or prepare for this sort of thing (which is a blessing.  Some schools still have mostly professors that emphasize memorization/low level applications only until you hit the highest level undergraduate seminar courses which not everyone is required to take.  Some folks elsewhere will leave their life sciences programs having no or very little exposure to primary literature in subdisciplines of their major because no instructors found that important enough to integrate or emphasize.  And this is really bad in the case the student has not done undergraduate research). The proliferation of courses with discussion sections was meant to mirror what this BCDB 501/502 course (glad they retired IBS 555/556 as a requirement) is doing by focusing on or getting students lots of exposure to literature in whatever area. Since most will only have experience with textbook driven learning in biol 14x, I'll admit that reading and discussing tough papers in things like genetics, microbiology, disease ecology, ecology, cell biology, or evolution may seem like a nuisance or an unneccessary increase in workload, but it is actually very helpful to both the pre-health and pre-grad crowd.\n\nAnd if you are more chemistry/chemical biology spectrum, maybe measure yourself up/compare what you learned to more advanced/graduate MIT courses (when it comes to graduate school, top tier programs tend to follow each other. The level and style of courses as well as other expectations offered in top tier and well-funded grad programs differs much less around the top 20-40 or whatever graduate programs vs. the wild departmental level variations you can see in demands and style undergraduate courses of places ranked in the top whatever of USNews. There are hardly no patterns.  Despite what some students who know nothing like to say, two schools being \"elite\" does not mean they are similar academically in your areas of interests.  Similar ranked schools have very different teaching cultures especially in areas that are under a lot of pressure to improve and reform pedagogy like STEM.  Some places have responded to those pressures far more than others with Emory, WUSTL and many top tier publics and LACs being among them): [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/).\n\nPay specific attention to biological chemistry 2 (and they do have a more interesting than normal bchem 1 course as well), and advanced organic classes (Emory has really good organic courses that inspire many students to go into it or natural products for graduate school) .  This can give you an idea of what you are getting into.  It is pretty much just a lot of solving problems that you haven't exactly practiced before.  You get practice in grad. school or a good teacher, but the teachers with higher standards will take some liberties and ask you to do at least a few items that are a step beyond the complexity that you were explicitly exposed to in lecture or a p-set and that is okay!  It's a very similar thing to those written pre-lims above.  It is unlikely that the scenarios on the exam are the same as the courses you took to prep for them.  Some will be easier, some on par, and some a bit more complex.  Again, get used to life not being \"fair\" and super predictable.\n\nSo for the chem/chemical bio folks: Don't get upset at the Sorias, McDonalds, and Weinschenks (or McGill in some rare cases.  I don't see why people get upset in gen. chem, but okay) that make you deal with complex molecules or do explain/derive complex models.  They are trying to mold you into professionals and more flexible thinkers and prep you for upper divisions and grad courses in the area.  They are basically pitching their course at the same(or even slightly higher)  level that they do at the super elite places many Emory students claimed they wanted to go to but were rejected from like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Caltech, Stanford, and MIT(lol).\n\nThat is what y'all thought you wanted right? Never play yourself into thinking you are getting the same level of training as those places (students at some other Emory tier schools have deluded themselves into believing this.  They are clueless and it is sad), but just at a less prestigious institution if you fear the type of course and learning I am promoting.  In STEM, this is the NORM at such places, and students can't really dodge such instructors and courses or complain their way out of it, so no, prestige and maintaining it is not the only reason these places prefer and feed their own students into their grad and professional programs.  They know that they generally train better than even other elites.  My point of all this is to make you aware of the expectations so that you are more likely to choose giving yourself training that ensures and proves that they are wrong (at least in your case).",
