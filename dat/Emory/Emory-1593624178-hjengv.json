      "text": "Whatever recommended range advisors give you (which I think maybe 15-17.  They usually recommend enough so that you can withdraw from a 3 hour course and remain a full time student) usually Realize the credit hour system is wonky and won't always correlate with intensity, workload, or even contact time.  Like all CWRs are 4 hours because they supposedly have significant amounts of contact time with professors outside of class to phase the writing assignments but of course not all abide by the supposed structure of a CWR.  \n\nSome courses with 4 hours have formal discussion sections/additional effort required.  You'll probably end up with 4-5 courses plus PACE/Health 100 or whatever assuming you have mostly 3 hour courses.  Either way be careful not to take per course credit hour allocations face value as some indicator of intensity level.  You may run into a 3 hour course significantly more intensive/busy than a 4/5 hour or something. You never know.",

              "text": "Huh?! No worries, I just give all that disclaimer because MOST students do and will fear or feel overly comfy with certain amounts of credit hours when it is mostly about the individual courses that comprise the courseload and how they are space.  I think they are only 1 P/F hour",

Last semester was a shit show, and by what some of my profs have told me, it won't be much better. College is a massive adjustment, and online classes are super tough. Don't be too hard on yourself, at least not right now.",
