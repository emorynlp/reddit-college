I have multiple friends who have rebuilt their schedules during add drop swap. It\u2019s likely as a freshman where you\u2019ll pick up courses you want to be in. \n\nAs far as psych goes, I believe Kazama is very good. If you aren\u2019t a hard science major, it\u2019s common for people to pick up their lab credit using astronomy (Phys 116). Dr. Bonning teaches it, and she is a terrific teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed class with her last fall. \n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. Best of luck!",

I my freshman year roommate tried to register for a freshman seminar through the music department, accidentally ended up registering for a philosophy seminar, and ended up majoring in philosophy. I was a CS/Math major but my favorite classes were the philosophy and religion classes I took for Gen ends or just because I thought they were interesting. (shout out to Dr. Gough and Dr. Robbins in the Religion department). \n\nAlso don't take 8:30am classes if you can avoid it.",

      "text": "Dr. Katrina Dickson in classics is a goddamned ANGEL for your history education requirement. Literally the kindest soul, and she's been teaching online for 20 years. Try to get her Classics 104 (HSC) and 102 Mythology (HAP?) courses if you need filler hours or the credit. The myth class was super fun, especially if you grew up on Percy Jackson or just think greek gods are cool. Don't exploit that kindness or you'll have a mob after you. Read her rate my prof, but only the good ones. They're honest.\n\nI took Philosophy 110 Intro to Logic for my math credit (yeah, you read that right). I fucking hated the TA but Dr. Jessica Wahman is good. \n\nCan't rec Dr. Eric Varner in art history enough. Branch out for your freshman seminar! I took his Caesars seminar (ARTHIST/CL 190) and LOVED IT! It's about the emperors of Rome and their art. don't be deterred by the 3-hr class time, he gives you a break and you don't forget anything between meetings. Dr. Varner is more intimidating than a roman statue but he's kind, flexible, and forgiving once you crack him and show that you care. Note: he and Dickson have been friends/colleagues longer than any of us have been alive. \n\nBiggest advice on classes? take something totally balls to the walls unrelated that's FUN and breaks up your schedule and work. Getting a B in that class or a required class you don't like (like math for me) is OK! Focus your grades on major classes, the rest will come easy.",

      "text": "Gonna quote good ol' u/[oldeaglenewute2022](https://www.reddit.com/user/oldeaglenewute2022/)\n\n\"Advice: Do not be scared or afraid of being challenged for a grade, especially in classes that matter for your career path or are of academic interest. As a freshman (even 1st semester), try to get GOOD professors and not merely just \"easy\" professors (do not conflate the two. Again, I know it is hard because students are naturally risk averse, especially those on very GPA sensitive career paths). Basically, give yourself a \"doable challenge\" freshman year that teaches you to build real study skills/work ethic, think critically (try not to choose professors that only have exams as part of the grade and then those exams only require cramming followed by regurgitation. Sounds like high school for many. Why pay or have some donor 70k of tuition for High School 2.0?), etc without overwhelming yourself. I don't know if I agree on the RMP thing mentioned earlier because some professors just have a lot of ratings so 15 so so or \"bad\" ratings out of 50+ may not be horrible. Also, take RMP with grains or even chunks of salt because they tend to be full of ratings by people with strong enough opinions in either direction to rate them. Like if you are taking someone who teaches a 70+ person lecture each year and has been at Emory for a while, I don't know how reliable the ratings are. I would actually READ the context of the ratings because sometimes they can be really petty and almost be reduced to: \"How dare you challenge me for my grade. This was supposed to be Emory State University and you were supposed to set the bar low\". For example, we have this petty rating for Dr. Thomas Bing, which is no doubt the top introductory physics professor at Emory from a person who claimed they made an A:\n\n\"We had at least 2 hours of mandatory HW a night, and that didn't even include studying. **Exams were extremely difficult because he doesn't teach everything you need to know. You need to take what he taught you and apply it to concepts you haven't seen**. Also the class itself is so fast-paced it's very easy to fall behind. Overall I do not recommend\"\n\nFrom the looks of it, appears they took it this summer and this whole rating appears like a complaint about the challenge of an EMORY STEM course during the summer. How does one expect a slow pace during the summer and why would anyone expect an Emory STEM instructor to write exam items that are identical to homeworks or problems worked in class (the stuff in bold should be a feature and not a bug at a top tier university If you've seen the exact same problem before and then are told to solve it on an exam then it isn't a problem anymore!)? This rater is a problem, but is rare because you'll find that most students DO expect physical sciences instructors to challenge them (which is why he and the top tier chemistry instructors still have very high ratings overall). And if you are in the life sciences (biology and NBB for example), be extremely careful. Students come in with \"expectation biases\" where they expect such teachers to be only focused on memorization (despite it being Emory/a high caliber school) because that is how they learned and got As in those subjects in k-12, when they really weren't supposed to be taught and tested that way even then, so you'll see even some awared winning biology teachers (at all levels too, so intro and higher), most who veer away from memorization oriented assessments/approaches to teaching, get a LOT of ratings that look like the physics above. and honestly some teachers in the life sciences with anything above 3.0/5.0 for quality should be considered (now you SHOULD run if a person can't really break like 3.2/5.0 but has like a 3.2 or lower for difficulty. This means that they are being perceived as easy but still get rated poorly! That is a red flag. Anyone above or significantly above 3.5 for difficulty but has 3.5+ for quality overall is likely pretty damned good! That difficulty range is where you should expect to see more naysayers and people complaining about being challenged unexpectatedly and whatnot). Just figure out if the bad ratings mostly come from perceived \"difficulty\" or if they come from perceived incompetence.\n\nThere is a difference and you'll have to realize that a lot of students, especially those younger students (so that would be the rising sophomores)) taking intro. courses are not that mature and may come in with problematic expectations (such as: \"I was perfect in high school and took the related AP/IB course for this in high school, so I am supposed to be coasting because I already have experience in the area. If I am not coasting, it must be the teacher's fault for not testing us only on things that they explicitly covered in lecture. I shouldn't be expected to draw connections or apply what was covered to slightly different stuff\" or \"they were tricky!\" or \"they wrote confusing questions\"...all this, what is often non-sense that essentially says \"you aren't supposed to make me do complex things or answer more complex questions in freshmen courses\") so you have to consider that context when you read some of these ratings. Don't take it just face value. Be really careful because you may miss out on VERY good teachers who really care about students because you bought into bad ratings which in total said \"Ya know, I wasn't expecting to be academically challenged in this way\" which is honestly the job of most of the instructors. I mean you have people complaining that they had to work and think hard for an A in a STEM class. No duhhh! If it wasn't that way, THAT is when you should be concerned that you are paying too much money for Emory. One could pay far less at a local state school if they wanted to be bored.\n\nI would say above RMP, maybe use us on here as well as upper classmen first to get opinions on professors and courses and try not to be superficial in terms of what you ask for as tempting as it is sometimes. Beyond whether the person asked if the course was \"easy\" or \"hard\" or whatever, ask if the material seemed interesting, if the professor seemed enthusiastic/tried to really help students learn and develop. Maybe ask if a typical weekly workload in the course involves going beyond just reviewing notes and reading (I think many gbio classes now have a decent amount of graded HW and still have weekly quizzes, so are more like gen. chem and the physics courses). Does the instructor just lecture? Is the class flipped/has lots of in-class activities? Maybe even ask for a syllabus if they have one. Try to get as much info. as you can because the \"easy\" and \"hard\" stuff can be subjective depending upon the background and academic seriousness of the person you are soliciting information from.\"",

      "text": "If you are interested in psychology, the Kazama train is a great start.  I don't know what else, but besides the person who quoted me below, I do agree with another poster that the philosophy and religion courses at Emory are excellent (would have been nice if Dr. Patterson had not retired, but there are still plenty of other awesome religion professors).  Voluntary Core affiliated courses also have top tier instructors.  If you want to explore humanities and social sciences, look out for those.  Outside of those, maybe try Dr. Lancaster's frosh seminar (political science).  The man is a legend and even those who never plan to major in political science end up loving him.  Daniel LaChance in history seems to have a great reputation.  They have a new course in history called history 100 that seems to be a hit.  There are plenty of options that will likely allow you to be more impressed (or at least learned) with Emory than feeling like you are a freshman that has to just check off requirements so is merely \"tolerating\" boring survey courses.  Of course some are more intellectually intense than others, but hey! It's Emory, even as a freshman, 2-3 of the courses (maybe even 4) you take across freshman year should perhaps work your brain cells a bit/have you do some learning and assignments at a higher level than your HS, or maybe even give you a run for the money at times.  You don't have to take the most boring/easiest stuff/people out of fear all the time. Just make a manageable schedule that allows you to adjust to college style academics as needed (though the social life might be toned down this upcoming semester :( which makes that more doable even with a couple of academically challenging courses I guess).",
