I was thinking of putting \"1762 CLIFTON RD NE\u201d for street address and \"EMORY UNIVERSITY - MAIN MSC 012345\u201d for the Apt. Is there a better way to put it or is this fine? Let me know how you did it if you\u2019ve had things delivered before through Amazon. Since I\u2019m buying a bunch of things, I\u2019m very worried and meticulous abt it. \n\nThank u guys/girls",
