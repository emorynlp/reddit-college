      "text": "Emory can be generous but they look at more than the EFC from FAFSA. For example, if you\u2019re parent have a lot of assets (ex. Stocks, saved money, 401K etc) that will impact the aid you get. If you\u2019re concerned about your finances, maybe not ED because that could put you in a bad situation if you cannot afford it. You can always reach out to the the financial aid office too and they can give more info.",

The reason for this is because I have two other siblings in college rn. If they dont meet your needs you can always try to appeal and get more money. Emory isn't like NYU, they are pretty generous in aid.",

They gave me loans for that amount and a work study job on top. My friend in the 50k range got almost full, probably paid around 3k a year. and if finances are the main issue, you can probably get out of ED commitment. Id say apply.",
