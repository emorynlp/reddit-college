  "text": "Can any bio majors here let me know if they took math 111 or math 116 for their major requirements ? The website says that we can take 7 classes from other science and math departments. I\u2019m probably just going to fulfill that requirement with physics 142 and chem 204 anyways since I\u2019m pre med. but are the math credits (like calc) still required for bio major??",

              "text": "Sure thing..but I imagine the bio doc. Is more confusing for you as an applied math person because the math requirement is geared towards standard bio majors/pre-med types(which I am guessing OP is. The doc. Should be pretty clear for them but I don't know maybe they are also QTM?). With applied math they have to build in exceptions. Be sure to work closely with an advisor when you get to Emory, especially major advisors. And maybe consider the bio QTM track or taking some of the more computational bio focused courses when they are available (like definitely take Berman's class and computational modelling) especially if you are considering paths outside of medical school (even then it could be beneficial in unforeseen ways)",

When people cling to that pre-health label too much, they tend to become super risk averse in terms of course selection and if you become that way early, you may miss out on things or professors that may have signaled that another direction is for you. But good luck though. Emory is becoming much more friendly to your type ( those who are interested in both life sciences and math).",
