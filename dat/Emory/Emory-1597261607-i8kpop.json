  "text": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m a rising third-year who is interested in finding an Emory pen pal. I\u2019ll be staying remote this semester, and I thought a pen pal might be an interesting way to stay connected and meet new people at Emory. Snail mail could be fun, but I\u2019m thinking email would be the most convenient way to stay in touch. \n\nTo any first years (or underclassman), I would especially love it if you reached out. The transition to college can be difficult, and this semester is especially daunting. I am interested in understanding how you are coping during this time, and I would be more than happy to share my experiences and offer any advice and support I can. \n\nFor anyone interested here is a bit more info about me:\n\n\\- Year: Third Year\n\n\\- Major: NBB\n\n\\- Track: Pre-health\n\n\\- Hobbies: Improv comedy & singing\n\n\\- Pronouns: She/her\n\nDrop a comment or PM me if you would like to get in touch!",
