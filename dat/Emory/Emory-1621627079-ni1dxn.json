Maybe I just didn\u2019t meet the right people, but even when we \u201cwent out\u201d it was to a shitty dive bar, and even Greek life parties are seriously lacking in comparison. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not fun? It depends on what you\u2019re looking for. If you want the stereotypical movie college experience, that\u2019s not going to happen at Emory. I won\u2019t sugar coat that for you. I personally feel that the school makes up for it by being amazing in other areas, but if partying is super important to you, I urge you w/o judgement to go to a state school.",

There are enough parties at Emory and there are tons of colleges in the vicinity along with the city of Atlanta so options are there",

          "text": "I don't know if this makes sense (plus Greek life at Emory is starting falling more towards 20-25% which I think is okay. People need to be more creative in how they party and have fun instead of relying on that anyway).   NYU is in freaking NYC so it is easy to go to parties, raves, bars, and throw parties WITHOUT Greek life. Furthermore, Greek scenes at different schools can look very different(Emory's can be good but is arguably on the tamer side even amongst privates with high Greek presences). The main differentiator between Emory and those other schools (I forget about Tulane though) is that D1 sports has significant influence on the vibe and usually elements of the big money sports scene interacts with Greek life.\n\n Even with lower Greek %s, those places would still be very different from Emory.  And Duke is nowhere near the \"party school\" it used to be despite having both of those elements. In fact some are saying it is beginning to feel sort of like an East Coast Stanford (which commonly gets complaints of not being enough of a party school much like Emory does).  There are also schools that are quite creative (like some of the upper tier Ivies) and probably more interesting than a lot of these places and they don't rely on a Greek system or D1 sports scene to fuel their social scene. It is sort of DIY. \n\n To me it looks like whether a party scene is big(at a selective private) or more \"public school like\" is more correlated with distribution of majors (like there are whole books on \"party pathways\" in college and Emory has too few or recruits too few who pursue them. The business school may in some ways approximate a party pathway but its standards are high for a business school) and whether a significant amount of students are in fluffier majors (and I could drop names of those and what elites they exist at but I won't) and Emory students heavily cluster in natural sciences, math, a business school with a curve, nursing, economics, and increasingly QTM.  These are not folks who(for the most part at least) can constantly party hard AND get good grades for their major or track.",

          "text": "I get you being funny haha but I'm down with them partying all night sometimes! Did it myself. It is just that I'm not understanding these expectations that most selective privates will feel like large publics or like \"public school lite\" socially.  It doesn't make but so much sense(And no one seems to hold HYPSM etc to this standard). Again, I think often large and continuous party scenes are created at schools with huge cohorts of students that pretty much cluster in majors that aren't that demanding or avoid the rigor within their demanding majors.  Elite privates are largely known for more consistently rigorous academics which causes social life to look different.  \n\nI think the question always should be \"do I wanna have a good time constantly and just party all the time and get an 'education'\" or \"do I wanna have a pretty good time when I can, but make the needed sacrifices at times to ensure I get a GOOD education\"(and maybe HYPSM, etc attract people who answer \"yes\" to the latter).  Emory won't stop anyone from doing the latter, but the former is harder if you want to optimize  return on investment.  You may as well go somewhere cheaper and do the former.",

                      "text": "You can basically do that anywhere if that is true.  And people at elites, even those without the SEC vibe (most in the T20-30 don't have that) ARE doing that.  Also, don't conflate focusing on \"academics\" with focusing on grades.  I see people at the \"elites\" with SEC vibes/party atmospheres do this.  If you criticize them for having weaker intellectual vitality than other schools(including heavy pre-professional schools like Emory, WUSTL, JHU), the students will say: \"We care about our grades and do school our work too but we just know how to balance\"(as if others don't-what they usually aren't telling you is that they are likely in a pretty low workload major or one with low intellectual demands OR if in a STEM, the STEM isn't really the same type as other places. And at some places, a majority of even pre-meds are choosing fluffy pathways that overlap with pre-med requirements).  That isn't the same as really \"focusing on academics\".  It is more like: \"Most of us just treat academics as a chore, get it done, and go party\". These aren't the places full of students positioning themselves to do an honors thesis when they can just earn a certain GPA and get latin honors, nor those who take the better professors (even if they are harder) because they learn more (they tend to be more swayed by personality and entertainment value). Outside of GPA boosters and ease, they sort of just flippantly select professors and courses (even within their major) and check off a grade.\n\nPeople don't actually wanna be immersed in it as much and it is notable that a lot of those places don't have the same \"style\" of rigor in things like STEM (or even some social sciences) as comparable calibre/ranked schools that are lesser so party schools (and note the latter is MOST of elite colleges and universities), AND the students heavily cluster in fluff majors one ones that give easy grades/have low workloads and are kind of high yield (largely because the student body is richer and more well connected so they get better outcomes pursuing an analogously easy pathway than students at a public with much less wealthy students) and this is probably because professors understand that the students kind of aren't there to be challenged in that way.\n\nWhen everyone is pretty distracted, it doesn't take as much for them to feel challenged by the academics, and if it goes a notch higher (perhaps to the level one would expect given the incoming credentials which say they can handle or should be receptive to some fairly advanced and intellectually demanding stuff), students in these environments will resist or buckle under the pressure because they simply aren't as receptive as their test scores and GPA suggest. They came to the school to join a social scene that was marketed to them and then get the shiny degree to leverage in the end, and that's all fine (that may be your more average student, even if they are high achievers).  But you have to be honest and evaluate whether you are one of those people and then aim your applications and enrollment decision accordingly because a lot of selective schools aren't trying to make themselves a fit for that type.  Like Emory doesn't even give GPA based Latin honors.\n\nYou have to do a thesis (which means a significant research project) in your area of interest to get it so Emory's system doesn't reward those who had a good time and did well in courses at much and generally incentivizes people to have as a good of a time as they can (in a variety of ways, not just parties and stuff), but also fully IMMERSE themselves in something academic (and departmental prizes are like this as well.  Like they aren't going to choose a student for an award for \"Academic excellence in X\" simply if they have a 4.0, they may look for the 3.8-3.9 or whatever that is completing their honors thesis or is published).",
