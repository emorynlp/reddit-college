  "title:": "How restricted will things be? Is it true that a lot of people will have to stay in their rooms all day?",
  "text": "I\u2019m an incoming freshman, and I\u2019m currently deciding whether or not I want to live on campus.\n\nWill it really be that hard to socialize? Being able to talk/hang out with people is a big reason as to why I\u2019d be going. With classes and clubs going online, and a lot of places such as the cafeteria being restricted, it seems like there\u2019d be a lot less opportunities to do that. And how would that look like anyways? Would I have to do things like go in random dorms or talk to people that are sitting outside to meet new people? I\u2019m shy though so um, don\u2019t know how stuff like that would work out.\n\nI was kind of looking forward to going to the library too (don\u2019t know if students will be able to use that) since it\u2019s hard for me to study at home. If I\u2019m going to stay in my room all day I\u2019d rather do that at my home than in Atlanta though. Saving some money would be nice, but my parents don\u2019t really care.",

They already had to reserve an entire dorm for swine flu back in 09, and I imagine they don't want to (and maybe can't now) do that again.\n\nPlease don't actively try to dodge the rules. I know making friends in college and stuff can be hard, but you really don't want Emory blowing up with COVID cases.",
