  "text": "I am a different commenter then the author of original post, but I am also a graduating senior who is saddened by my time at Emory. I think the Class of 2021 was just at Emory at the wrong time. First two years the DUC was under construction and we were eating in the DUCling. There was really no gathering space like the student center and the entire freshman quad was cut off by the construction. These factors might have exacerbated Emory's problem already with fostering a community. However, by our junior year, we finally got a lot of that back with the student center! But when COVID hit during that same year, we were again separated from our friends. The decision to bring back the freshman makes sense from a financial point of view, but man I miss my friends. I know I should be grateful for graduation even happening in the first place, but it is sad that I will see my friends for the first time in a year just to say goodbye to them. \n\nI apologize for bringing negativity to the subreddit and I hope everyone's experiences at Emory are different than mine.",

      "text": "I really wish sharing our honest thoughts about our time at Emory wasn\u2019t met with so much hostility. Not everyone is going to have a picture perfect college experience and I wish folks would be more empathetic than dismissive when they hear others point out negatives from their 4 years here. I was class of 2020 and I do feel like the class of 2021 got the short end of the stick when it comes to accessing specific campus resources in the middle of the pandemic and dealing with endless construction, offices moving, etc. Your feelings are valid and I have many friends currently at Emory who feel the same way about how COVID has completely upended the college experience they expected to have. I know it\u2019s not much from a total stranger, but I am sending you my love and best wishes! I am always here for anyone who comes across this comment if they want to talk or vent.",

I\u2019m a current freshman (going to be a sophomore) and I genuinely thought they should\u2019ve let seniors come first and not freshman. I do love Emory a lot but that doesn\u2019t mean that I get offended by someone else\u2019s negative experience. You don\u2019t have anything to apologise for!",
