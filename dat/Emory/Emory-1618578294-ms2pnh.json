      "text": "I went to Oxford. I really liked the classes I took there and the small community helped to forge strong friendships. \n\nIf Oxford\u2019s distance to the Atlanta campus was like that between Duke\u2019s East and West campuses (~10 min shuttle ride), then I would pick Oxford again in a heartbeat. However, its distance from the Atlanta campus made it a bit difficult to get involved in clubs when you matriculate there during your second semester of sophomore year/first semester of junior year. Even so, it seems that there has been a lot of effort put into unifying the two campuses in recent years - which is great to see. \n\nSo yeah, I\u2019d say maybe pick the Atlanta campus as it is easier to get involved in activities for four years from there. But try speaking to a current Oxford student to see how easy/difficult it is to get involved with Atlanta campus clubs.",

          "text": "Is having way more classes early on necessarily \"better\"?  I l started at and loved ECAS, but I'm not convinced.  It kind of assumes that those courses are run just as well or better (that there is significant amounts of quality control) vs. just being an option to choose from (and you can choose a lot of things run by some research faculty who is teaching undergrads as an annual obligation if you aren't careful. May result in an easy grade, but trashy experience).  Despite all those wonderful \"choices\", I found lots of cherrypicking (that 1st and 2nd years are often terrible at.  A course title/brief description and questionable RMP ratings are often the guide) neccessary.  And being in STEM (and I imagine this definitely is the case in some social sciences which also tend to have pretty large intro. courses on main), I can tell you that some end up with really weak intro. experiences that harm them later.  But hey, they \"chose\" that.\n\nECAS IS probably better if you have AP credits and intend to accelerate (I think math and physics that allow students to accelerate quickly) or are in a humanities area that is pretty flexible with pre-requisite structures (so you can take special topics and whatnot very early on and of course ECAS has way more).  But if you are a more \"average\"(not accelerating or anything) Emory student on highly structured tracks/majors where 1st and 2nd years on both campuses tend to take the same things in those years, I feel like that gets a bit iffy.",

                  "text": "It sounds like you had a bad time at Oxford, sorry. But for any prospective or current Oxford students reading this, here are the pros and cons of going to Oxford from a graduating OxAlum:\n\nPros\n\nOxford's small class sizes means you get to know your classmates and professor better. It's really easy to form a relationship with your prof (Ox professors genuinely care about you) and if they like you enough, you'll get leadership and research positions. AT Emory ATL, professors don't seem to be as warm in general (less or no office hours, conversations are impersonal). Also more competition for leadership positions.\n\nThere is a better sense of community at Oxford. It felt like people actually cared about each other (I guess bc it's small and convenient to hangout). My closest college friends were from Oxford, and I think it has a much better social scene. At Emory ATL, it felt like everyone was doing their own thing and it was sort of a depressing environment bc so many people i talked to felt stressed and overworked.\n\nAt ATL, I was so overworked that if I went to a party or something, I would have to sacrifice sleep or studying. At Oxford, you can have all 3: sleep, social, and study.\n\nFREE COOKIES EVERY WEEK at Oxford and events like petting zoos, bouncy castle, ferris wheel, foam parties, Dooley's tavern parties, super smash tournaments. And for finals week events, EVERYONE would go and because it's a small campus, you know so many people it's just a great time. I never had any sort of feeling of solidarity like that at Emory ATL.\n\nIf you're a bio major, Bio at Oxford >>> Bio at Emory (just comparing the 100-300 level classes). Just trust me, any OxAlum bio major would agree.\n\nOSB is really nice and new, and if you're doing bio or chem labs, they are higher quality at Oxford. I remember my orgo lab at Emory ATL felt like I was using old backroom equipment from the 90s (because I was).\n\nAcademically, Oxford performs better than Emory ATL campus. Students at the top of Emory's graduating class every year are disproportionately Oxford continuees. No, it's not because the classes are easier, it's because there's little to no distractions so you have a ton of time to study.\n\nCons\n\nOxford is two years, so clubs fluctuate wildly in popularity. Every year, it feels like the campus dynamic could change. Luckily, it felt pretty good for my 2 years being there. Also, this means your ECs are Oxford are maximum 2 years commitment.\n\nEmory ATL has more EC opportunities than Oxford. ATL itself has a ton of EC opportunities whereas Covington is a ghost town in comparison. Doesn't mean you can't get quality ECs at Oxford, but your options are more plentiful at ATL.\n\nEmory ATL food options are way better. Just facts.\n\nWill reiterate this: Covington is a ghost town compared to Atlanta. Mystic grill and other niche places are interesting for a few visits, but Covington square gets old in a few months. ATL has alot more going on.\n\nOxford social scene tends to get a little cliquey, so that's a good or bad thing depending on the person.\n\nYou're more likely to meet a prestigious researcher, writer, or artist at Emory ATL than Oxford, although depending on who you are, this might not really matter to you.\n\nMore options for Emory ATL facilities (gym, student health, study area), although considering the proportions of class size vs campus area, Oxford meets the needs of its students.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall: If you want a more personal, community based, and relaxed college experience while getting an academic head start in your first 2 years, Oxford is best. If you want more options in terms of ECs, food, facilities, city life, and length of commitment, go for Emory ATL. Neither campus is superior over the other, both produce immensely successful students and are great in their own ways.",
