  "text": "Hey guys! I received the tremendous priviledge of acceptance to Emory, but truth be told, I'm really scared about coming down here. I'll be moving across the country and I don't think I'll know anybody. I really want to come down here because of all the opportunities it holds and I could envision myself having a great time over there, but I'm still really, really, really scared. I'm afraid I might not be good enough, I'm honestly really scared of being alone, and I'm just intimidated by it right now. I still really, really, really want to come and I'm just looking for advice if you all have any. It would really be much appreciated. \n\nThank you so much for your time, I'm sorry it was a bit of a ramble. \n\ntl;dr: Moving across the country and idk anyone and I'm terrified as hell to go to Emory, even though I really want to.",

I would say Emory is much more manageable than my last school, not easy per se, but I definitely get a ton out of my classes and feel like I am learning, developing, and creating a network. The culture is not as rah rah as other places, it\u2019s less Greek than schools like USC but more so than Georgetown, but I would say that the small class sizes and strong athletics make it the top D3 small school in the nation. This isn\u2019t like Stanford or duke where you have under-qualified athletes and legacy admits walking amongst perfect SAT score admits (creates a toxic dichotomy imo). Everyone here is qualified to be here, it\u2019s becoming more international every year so you get that global presence, and the endowment is massive and they WANT to spend millions on the students.",

You'll be fine.  Emory is extremely diverse demographically and socially (you don't really need to have a \"type\" of personality to find a decent sized niche that exists at Emory), and there are so many resources to help you succeed academically/professionally, and they have (and are always enhancing) enhanced those or created even more resources to facilitate your success, so \"not being good enough\" is not an issue (the most aggressive students with high grades use things like tutoring services and other options the most, so seeking help is not looked down upon.\n\nEmory isn't a place where people are heavily judged by intelligence levels/how easy things are for them (hard work is valued and serious effort to learn and succeed is valued however), so the social ramifications of seeking help or struggling in some contexts are basically non-existent).  Everyone can get a little scared initially, but most likely, you will find your paralysis unwarranted when you arrive.  Come in with a good attitude, try to make friends, use the resources when needed, put your best effort forward, and you should be fine.",

Saying no to another school means closing a potential pathway in your life, which can be nerve-wracking. However, I would just pay the deposit, you'll like your experience.",
