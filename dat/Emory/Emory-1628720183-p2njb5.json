  "text": "Hey! I am interested in living off campus to save money. I can see myself paying $500-800 in rent including utilities and don't mind living w apartment-mates. \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations?\n\nIs it too late to sign a lease?\n\nI don't have a car, so I'd need a place that has shuttles going to Emory College. \n\nPlease help. I'm very confused and appreciate every bit of guidance and advice! Thank you!",

      "text": "hi! i would suggest joining the emory and ga tech apartments/subleases group on fb! there are plenty of people on there looking for roommates/apartments. it might be a bit late to sign a lease on your own since many places near emory are filled up and you may not be able to find a place in ur specific price range on your own. a lot of the apartments near emory start around 1k and go up to 2k so i would keep this in mind. good luck!",
