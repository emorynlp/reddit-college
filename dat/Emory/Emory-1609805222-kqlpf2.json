      "text": "Typically it's harder than the top Ivies, but a little more than 20% of the graduating class goes in to consulting (many go in to finance), but there are still various resources to have an opportunity in consulting. The firms you mentioned have all recruited on campus in the past and have had students go to each firm, but again it still isn't easy. Apart from the firms you listed, Deloitte, PWC, and EY along with FTI Consulting and Insight Sourcing Group recruit heavily on campus. If you go on LinkedIn, you can see where alumni ended up. Additionally, here you can see the distribution of what sectors grads go to and what companies students have ended up at: [https://goizueta.emory.edu/documents/BBAEmploymentReport.pdf](https://goizueta.emory.edu/documents/BBAEmploymentReport.pdf)",

              "text": "One problem I have with this is that there is virtually no good data on this and then the older data that was available does not take into account demand to enter these from those top Ivies and Ivy Plus schools so you have no idea about a success rate of applicants.  Some schools are clearly producing more students who wanna do.that stuff and thus any ranking tallying the amount that enter these firms from each school is sketchy at best.   And then you have to take into account the SE status differences and connectivity of students from certain schools in addition to that.  How would one know if it is only a matter of these places preferring certain graduates vs. their students not only spamming the firms but having \"other\" advantages that we can't see in numbers? Like Emory being one of the least wealthy student bodies among top tier publics and privates will likely affect all of that.  \n\nAlso to me, a prestige/\"recruitment\" correlation to anything like this or IB is not as straightforward as one would think.   Poets and Quants had some old data (that likely still holds) showing Brigham Young outperforming places like Brown and Vanderbilt with top IBs.  I think the person answered your question well. Those firms recruit at Emory but like those who get into them from elsewhere you need to be pretty damned good.  Do the best you can academically (and in internships) and use the career services resources to to optimize your chances. Giving you an estimate of a ranking is useless.\n\n*Another thing I'd add is that in addition to prestige and connectivity, many who get into those firms from top tier Ivies and Ivy Pluses often do academically well on VERY rigorous tracks.  Think an honors track for econ or math at places like Chicago and Harvard.  I'm sure that is even more so the case for less well connected students. You need to basically seem as if you have the same caliber of training as their \"favorites\" upon applying.  You can't really fake it at these other schools.  Keep in mind that those schools are favorites and that most do NOT have BBA programs.",

              "text": "Similar schools I have seen other people say are UNC, Rice, Carnegie Mellon, or Indiana. A big importance is networking and performance in school however, if you do poorly in school it will be much more difficult. But if you know someone high-up in a firm, you have a better chance. There's a lot of things that affect your chances, but Goizueta definitely can assist you (e.g. clubs, career center) in preparing for recruiting but of course YMMV.",
