      "text": "Only two things I can say is that Emory cares far more about the unweighted GPA than weighted, average was about 3.8-4.0 last year, so just keep that in mind. ([https://apply.emory.edu/discover/facts-stats/first-year.html](https://apply.emory.edu/discover/facts-stats/first-year.html)). Also, speaking as a VA admit, we aren't really a pull zone like New York or California. Moreover, if you're coming from NoVA, expect heavy competition. Most VA students seem to come from the Fredericksburg to Arlington range which can work either for or against you depending on your pool. Other than that, you seem plenty qualified.",

But as long as you have a good recommendations and essays (the two most important parts of the application) you will still be competitive.",
