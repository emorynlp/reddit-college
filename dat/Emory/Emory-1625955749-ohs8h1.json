  "title:": "Transfer Pre-Med Student Looking for Advice After Waitlisted for All Science Classes",
  "text": "The title pretty much says it all. I had an issue where my final college transcript was marked as a high school transcript and thus wasn't able to sign up for any classes during the first wave of registration. The mistake was Emory's processing team's but after talking to an Associate Dean, he reassured me that class registration is a process and I'll be able to get classes with due time. During the second wave of A/D/S, I was able to get on the waitlist for all the CHEM 203 classes but I'm 5th and 6th for Weinschenk sections (each is 100 people lecture) and 15th and 26th for Heemstra sections (each is 200 people). I'm also 8th on the waitlist for NBB 201 which is another 200 people class. I was wondering what the odds were that I'll be able to take both CHEM 203 and NBB 201 this semester? On another note, I saw several seats were available when I looked at Course Atlas for both classes during the first wave but again wasn't able to take them because of the lack of transfer credits due to the transcript issue. Should I try to talk to the Associate Dean and attempt to get an override into these classes? Sorry if this is a lot but I am extremely frustrated with the entire situation since I am trying to take the MCAT next year (currently a rising sophomore) but scared that I won't be able to because I won't be able to take orgo this year.",

      "text": "I think you will be able to get into weinchenk's chem 203 and nbb 201 during the first week of classes, if not during the summer, people drop classes all the time. I dont think your positions are that bad,  I transferred last year and was in a similar situation during the spring for some classes. \n\nYou can talk to the associate dean, I am not sure how they can help, but still ask it doesn't hurt. Feel free to reach out, I took these classes before (online format tho).",

      "text": "I would pull every strategy possible. You are in the age of the Emory undergraduate project that is really trying to get retention and grad. rates even higher so push all the levers. What I will say, is that your chances for Weinschenk are probably very strong because even though he is the best option IMO (for those who will take an MCAT or go to grad school at least), he is challenging enough such that a few usually get cold feet.  If you move up but don't quite make it to the top and get off, another strategy is to be aggressive and attend his class sessions the first week and inquire.  The only problem is that he is teaching in this round table room which actually DOES have limited seating, but I suspect they could possibly fit one more person per table.  NBB 201 is a giant lecture course so they may be open to overloads.",
