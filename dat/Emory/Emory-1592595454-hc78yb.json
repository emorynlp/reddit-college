  "text": "Hi I'm an incoming freshman and I was wondering if anyone had insight about what weight training PE courses are like at oxford. I've never done any kind of weightlifting and with covid I doubt I'll be able to get into it this summer because of closed gyms and sold out weights. Any info helps thanks!",

      "text": "I would agree with the first comment, it\u2019s not the best idea to take a PE class involving something you\u2019re interested in because your dreams are very likely to be crushed. There are several fitness classes offered multiple times a week, along with students that would be willing to help you get started with weightlifting. As a freshman, it\u2019s highly unlikely you\u2019ll get an optimal PE class so aim for whatever is at a good time and doesn\u2019t sound like a ton of work",

          "text": "Tai chi was one of my favorite classes at Oxford! But make sure to either take it with a friend (maybe someone in your orientation group) or try and make a friend the first day because the whole class is group work. Throwback to Childhood Games was also a dope gym class. You just play games like tag and kickball and the instructor will give days off during midterms to help reduce stress.",

I know Throwback to Childhood Games is unique to Oxford, but I believe Tai Chi is offered at both. A lot of my friends at the main campus took yoga or stress management and liked those too.",
