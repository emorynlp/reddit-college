  "text": "Hi. I am interested in pursuing Finance. I am also pretty bored this summer and I am wondering if I should learn some accounting, building financial valuation models, etc as a way to improve my chances of getting into Emory's finance-focused clubs. Will studying this stuff be helpful. Do the business clubs look for these technical skills? Is it useful to self-study this stuff or are there better things to study throughout summer?",

      "text": "Yes you can. It\u2019s usually based on your high school involvement/GPA and your personality, since there isn\u2019t much else to go off when you are a freshman. Business clubs don\u2019t look for the technical skills because they don\u2019t expect you to know anything anyways. It\u2019s more looking for passion, work ethic, and critical thinking. If anything, practice your interviewing skills. Also, don\u2019t be discouraged if you don\u2019t get in the first time you apply, the acceptance rate is very low.\n\nHowever, that stuff is worth learning if you wanna get a headstart on internship applying for sophomore summer/junior summer, as the recruiting timeline keeps moving earlier and earlier.",

      "text": "Yes, you can. In fact, most business clubs are looking for freshmen/sophomores who will join early, learn skills, and eventually take up leadership positions. You don't need to have technical skills aside from maybe a couple of clubs like Atlas or GIMG",
