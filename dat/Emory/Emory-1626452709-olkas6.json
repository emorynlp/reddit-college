  "text": "Hello everyone, i am a upcoming high school senior and i\u2019ve decided that i am going to apply ED to Emory. But i am a awful test taker. So far i\u2019ve taken 2 act\u2019s with the highest score being a 27. But i am planning on taking it again in September and the SAT in August. But realistically, i dont think ill be able to pull off a 32+ which is ideal for Emory applicants. But my hope gpa is a 3.9 with 10 ap classes by the time i graduate and i\u2019ve never taken a remedial class only AP or honors. In addition, i am a first generation hispanic whose parents never went to college and i am middle class. Also i am a officer for my school\u2019s HOSA and NHS clubs. So realistically speaking, what are my chances of getting accepted and should i apply without submitting test scores.\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention i was a GHP semifinalist if that has any value",

To be fair tho, i\u2019m a urm and was on the waitlist first before getting accepted to emory. i think it\u2019s more important on having a good personal statement and letters of recommendations than it is with stats. Honestly, if you get like a 29 or higher, i think you should report it, esp since you\u2019re also a urm.",

Looking back on last year\u2019s applicant pool, it\u2019s pretty clear that not submitting a score doesn\u2019t diminish the value of the application. I submitted a score, but, in the experiences of my friends who went test optional, it never hurt them. I knew a dude who was an incredibly qualified applicant but had a 26 on the ACT and got into Vandy regular decision with a full-tuition scholarship. I\u2019m willing to bet that wouldn\u2019t have been the case had he submitted his 26. Plus, any school is more willing to accept an applicant ED, regardless of if they submit a score or not.",
