  "text": "Hi guys\u2026. Incoming freshmen here\n\nI applied this school to study econ n business, and I was also interested in comp sci/data science so my main aim was to pursue BBA+QSS\n\nBut so far my registration became a disaster and I\u2019m super behind on the waitlist for core classes like Econ 101(19th) and math 111(32th)\u2026.\n\nSo far I only have qtm 110, ecs n hlth, first year writing, and intro to comp sci(only enrolled to satisfy f1 visa credits). What should I do now..? Should I just wait till next semester to take econ 101 and math 111? Or shud i email the profs and beg for extra seats?\n\n\nI really didn\u2019t expect this worst case scenario to happen and I m so frustrated that I might waste 80k/y to take classes I am not interested in :(",
