  "text": "What's up, I am gonna be moving to Atlanta this May and joining Emory's grad program for physical therapy. I'm not sure if there are any of you also joining the same class as me, but if you are, I'd like to get to know some of you before I get to Atlanta, so feel free to PM me. \n\nBut, I'm mostly just here to say what's up and get some recommendations of places to live around campus, as well as some recs for entertainment. Venues, restaurants, bars, parks, and just things to do in the area. \n\nI'm a pretty chill person, if you wanna help this guy navigate the area a little bit before I get there or just be friends, PM me.",

      "text": "I\u2019m Emory faculty, not a student, so I\u2019m guessing you wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with me. \ud83d\ude42 I moved here in 2018, and lived in 1133 on the Square in downtown Decatur for a year. The apartments are very nice but somewhat pricey. However living in downtown Decatur is really cool, and there\u2019s a free shuttle that goes from Decatur to campus every 10 or 20 minutes, so you don\u2019t have to worry about parking on campus which is really nice. If you can afford downtown Decatur, it\u2019s definitely the best place to live close to campus. It\u2019s very walkable, and there are tons of really good restaurants and cool little shops.",

      "text": "I graduated from the Nursing school last year but I'm still in the area working. Little 5 points is a little distance away, but super awesome. Piedmont park is a lot of fun when it's warm. It depends on what kind of food you like, music you like, etc. If you're into video games and beer, Battle and Brew is a lot of fun. There are some cool pool halls, night clubs, etc. The aquarium is a must as well!   \n\n\nWhen I moved here, I lived at Berkshire Howel Mill about 20 or so minutes away. Don't really recommend. If I could have chosen, I would have lived near Decatur for a while or in Midtown at the start of it all. I found my awesome roommate though on Facebook apartment listings and I will say there are a LOT of Emory and GA Tech students also looking for roommates and listing apartments!   \n\n\nCongrats on getting into the program, it's a really great one!",
