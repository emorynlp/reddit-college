If not, trust me, if you have been admitted and get an unfortunate or useless score, you won't be harmed.  You never know how you'll finish on those curves.  The worst that happens is you get a score(s) you can't leverage to get out of a requirement or accelerate. I think this is even the case if a prospective student.  As long as most of them are solid, you should be alright.",

I know a lot of other schools think online APs are bullshit and I\u2019m not fully following what Emory does so they may not even count it to begin with. Second, while there is a 12 AP credit limit this does NOT necessarily mean you can\u2019t use APs to bypass intro/easy classes to get to the more interesting upper level ones. Also each and every department has their own policy on how they count credits towards your major. If I remember correctly both Econ and Chem made an exception for me bc I had AP credits even though I would be going over my 12 credit limit. Most people don\u2019t really know how to optimize your AP credits so even though it\u2019s stressful I would strongly encourage taking them anyway",

Some AP credits will allow you to skip first year classes if you received a 4 or higher (5 for some cases like AP Bio)",
