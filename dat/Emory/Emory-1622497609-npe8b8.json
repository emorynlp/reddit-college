  "text": "Are Alabama and Harris the same hall/building/dorm?\n\nI might get Harris hall and I'm wondering how it is there in terms of the literal facility (ceiling height, size, cleanliness etc). Are there any other dorms that house freshmen that aren't the freshman dorms like few and Raoul and those ones clumped together on the quad?\n\nI heard that its not that great..\n\nI found this link below. Is this what it looks like now?\n\n[https://www.smithdalia.com/alabama-harris-halls-renovation/](https://www.smithdalia.com/alabama-harris-halls-renovation/)",

You know how the burgers at McDonald\u2019s on ads look nothing like the actual burgers they serve? Yeah, it\u2019s the same situation here. Technically it\u2019s the same, but it looks a lot more scuffed in person. Chairs/tables are messy, floor might be a little dirty, and it doesn\u2019t look that picturesque. \n\nIn all seriousness though, I think it\u2019s a pretty good res hall. Great location. At least you aren\u2019t in Woodruff/Clifton towers and have to walk 10 minutes to get to campus.",

I didn\u2019t live in Harris but my friends who did had to walk back to Harris late at night a lot of the times since my friends and i usually hung out in the freshman quad or in one of the dorms in the freshman quad. The hallways are super depressing and kinda make you feel like you\u2019re walking through a prison. But i will say the communal bathrooms are pretty clean and the rooms are clean and spacious. Also the study rooms are pretty nice. Harris is definitely underrated!",
