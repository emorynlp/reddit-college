      "text": "I\u2019m an ENVS alum, and while I didn\u2019t take this specific class, I can tell you that most 200 level courses normally require ENVS 131, but a lot of teachers in the department will let you bypass that requirement if you ask because 131 is difficult to get into (it fills up quick). \n\nI didn\u2019t take the AP exam, but professor Hall (who was my pre-major and major advisor) let me into her 200 level Environmental Geology course in my second semester because I had a strong interest in the subject. If you\u2019re really interested in the subject, I\u2019d reach out to professor Donaher to see what you can do, and keep a close eye on 131 to try and get in.",
