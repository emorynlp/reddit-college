          "text": "but wouldn't that lead to too much competition for certain majors? For example since Computer Science is a hot major right now, if too many people wanted to major in it after their time at Oxford and there's not enough capacity in CS classes, how would the college choose which students to admit as CS majors at the start of their junior year if they don't consider what major you wrote on your application?",

              "text": "Uhmmm...I don't think that is as relevant as you think because they probably make a prediction based upon current patterns in the college (or at both) and the propensity for people to switch majors. For example, despite how \"hot\" CS is everywhere it..like other STEMs has high attrition after foundation courses except at places so well known for CS that they attract and recruit an unusual amount of students already into it (so they can anticipate a super leaky pipeline where most ECAS and Ox freshmen do not continue CS beyons 170/171).  In addition, if they were truly worried about increase demand they wouldn't do that by making admissions the pipeline, they'd simply aim to hire more faculty (which has happened in CS).   Just as an alternative example(s), consider the fact that Emory, even after attrition has HUGE amounts of biology, chem(in fact this one is way above the national average and far above similar sized peer privates..more akin to the amount of chem majors at large publics), and NBB majors and the faculty in the latter two especially isn't but so big. \n\n If they were really considering that, the numbers would be more balanced and you wouldn't see the clustering in life sciences (particularly those considering pre-med which is a very high risk pathway) and business that you see based upon degree completion numbers.  No school, except those with engineering schools (which have very clear job pipelines) would want that type of clustering if it were selecting based on major (if anything they'd probably have a bias towards those pursuing low risk high yield pathways which is kind of what CS is IF students don't wanna drop as soon as get a B in a CS intro. Point is, I'm sure Emory would try to get as many CS folks as it can but it isn't known for that strength and competition between Emory and schools with ultra well reputed CS UG programs won't go in Emory's favor).\n\n  They kind of just do whatever (as in whatever results in a yield that meets the enrollment target. Admit a bunch of people claiming business and pre-med because that is currently a reliable constituent for the school in terms of who has serious interest in Emory vs who is applying \"just cause\").  It is my belief that they use those checkmarks as preliminary data to help departments decide how many seats to allocate to their foundation courses.  Like you'll see them start off with a higher amount of sections in some years versus others.",

      "text": "Hey!! Im currently a sophomore in Oxford :) \nChanging majors and tracks is super easy because as others have said, you don\u2019t have to declare a major at all until your sophomore year. Even afterwards you can still appeal to change your major. My friend changed her track from pre-med to pre-law last semester, I have a junior friend who has changed her major three times, I know people who have gone from Neuroscience to Polisci to business. I\u2019m a neuro major on the pre-med track and my advisor is a philosophy prof (go Mousie!) and my entire first semester didn\u2019t have a single STEM class.\n\nThe only issue I could think of is if you change your major/track later on, it may be difficult to complete the major requirements within the standard 4 years of college, but you\u2019re always able to talk to your advisor about that and overload if necessary, though it\u2019s not recommended. Hope this helps! :)",
