  "text": "So I\u2019ve been working on my SIRE application, but just received word that I\u2019ve been accepted for another internship off campus (but nearby) that I applied for and didn\u2019t expect to get. I will be working for a Dr in my field but not specializing in my specific interest. Still, I\u2019m very excited. \n\nShould I still apply for SIRE? Are there perks to being in the SIRE program that I won\u2019t experience in a regular internship? Or does it look better on a resume than a regular internship? \n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "I\u2019d take the regular internship. Ability to network, get exposed to what life is like outside of academia, etc. is important. If you want to do research, you can always do it during the school year but you can\u2019t usually do a thorough internship during that time. Just my two cents.",
