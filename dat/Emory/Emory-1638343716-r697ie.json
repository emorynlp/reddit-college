  "text": "I\u2019m interested in it since I\u2019m switching from pre med to bba but I want to know if it\u2019s worth it and what do people who are in the concentration expect to gain with it. I heard BBA student who choose to do the health innovation concentration usually plan to go into healthcare consulting, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m interested in that. Any thoughts or opinions would be greatly appreciated.",

          "text": "Planning to go through with a BBA in finance but bc I\u2019ve done basically only med-related extracurriculars and classes, I want to keep something health related in my coursework. If I don\u2019t pursue a career that\u2019s strictly finance, I was thinking of something along the lines of healthcare management. I just want to know what exactly you get out of this concentration because I\u2019ve never taken any health classes aside from HLTH 100 and want something that is stem related just out of interest.",

              "text": "Isn't that concentration still relatively new so you can't be sure because so few have done it?  Maybe contact Dr. Lampl about possibilities on how to develop towards that track.  Also, if you want to do something STEM related, and I know this is so not the Emory ethos, but you can still major in STEM without being pre-med(or pre-grad for that matter) AND it can be a major on top of your BBA.  Not only that but since you are no longer pre-med, you can actually take the better and more intellectually useful STEM courses that could maybe help you learn the research behind whatever field which alone could be more informative for a non-prehealth or pre-grad track (like the research focused bio and NBB courses often go into health related applications among other things.\n\nLike NBB's pharmacology and placebo class isn't just pure science, it discusses the business behind drug development and you get to have lectures from experts in drug development).  As for the Healthcare management thing, it appears as if you are more likely to learn about things more from a public health perspective and maybe even have some project oriented courses (like not just in the b-school, but in human health as well) which is good in terms of resume building and professional development for any \"off-beat\" (versus the typical Emory undergrad) path you may take career wise.  Also, it seems to be more linked to networking and professional development via certain lecture series and whatnot.  Sometimes there is more to a major and coursework than the content and admittedly depts like Human health, QTM, and of course all of GBS seem good at finding students oppurtunities to network or translate what they are learning.",

Or even just look people up on linkedin. There are also a few BBA people who then did a MPH you could probably find as well.",
