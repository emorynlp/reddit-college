      "text": "You probably need to talk to an advisor/faculty in the physics dept (maybe Bing who is DUS) to advise you on how to access a graduate engineering program.  The question shouldn't be about rigor (physics theoretically has enough of that) but whether or not the coursework can be tailored towards those goals and if you can take grad. classes or some at say, GT, that may help prepare you for that type of program. Also, you may want to target certain types of research projects and labs. So if they aren't available at Emory, you'd wanna do several REUs or fit a group at Tech in somehow.  You may also be encouraged to do a masters first, so just go look up the course recommendations and whatnot for good mechanical engineering programs (Do NOT conflate \"top grad program\" with \"ranked super high in USNWR for undergrad\".  The two may not overlap at all so don't get confused or bird like and only think of the brands you know now).\n\nEither way, my point is that hardly no one on here will know. That is a very unconventional pathway at Emory.  We do know that students aiming for a PhD in various physics subdisciplines are very successful.",
