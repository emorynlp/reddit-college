  "title:": "Is Emory's campus open for a visitor to drive through?",
  "text": "Hi all, I was recently accepted to Emory for grad school. I live somewhat close to Emory and was wondering if it would be possible for me to drive through the campus just to get a feel for it. I'd like to see more of the area before making the decision to accrue a bunch of debt, but I am aware that having gen public visitors is not allowed because of covid. That said, would I be able to just drive through the campus? Obviously would not get out of the car. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Most of the east part of campus is a huge teaching hospital. So the campus is quite open to the public, but the academic buildings are reserved only for students, faculty, and staff right now. As you tour make sure to walk through the quad. It is the oldest and loveliest part of campus.",
