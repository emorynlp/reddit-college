  "text": "Sorry if this is a dumb question, but how much would my aid go down living off campus? Right now I'm getting enough aid to cover tuition, housing, and part of meal plan, but would that likely go down to just tuition mainly if I chose to live off campus? Or would it remain near the same and allow me to put the money toward off campus housing?",
