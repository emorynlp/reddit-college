  "title:": "Question about AP/IB credits",
  "text": "Hi! I am an incoming freshman, and I am a little confused by the 12 credit cap emory has. With the classes I took, I should be able to skip CHEM 150 + 150L, BIOL 141, MATH 111 and ECON 101. So, a few questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Does the CHEM 150 + lab count as 3 credits or 5 credits towards the 12 AP/IB credits\n2. If I decide not to use one of these for credits (if it exceeds the 12 credits), do I get to still enroll in upperlevel classes without taking the prereq?\n3. If I skip MATH 111, do I start in 112 or 112z?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if the answers to these questions are obvious.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "1. You only get 3 even though you are exempted from lab(unlike for bio 141) as well\nExcept for calc. per this document: http://college.emory.edu/oue/documents/resource-a-to-z-files/ap-ib-equivalencies.pdf\nstates the following: \"All AP Courses (except AP Calculus BC) are equal to 3 credit hours on the Emory transcript. AP Calculus BC carries 6 credit\nhours on the Emory transcript.\"\n2. The above poster is not quite correct. The rules for credits that exceed your 12 is that most/many departments WILL allow you to leverage high passes in exams you didn't choose to advance past intros:\nhttps://apply.emory.edu/apply/first-year/tips/credits.html\n\"Beyond this 18-hour credit limit, we may allow additional exams or courses to fulfill prerequisites for placement into higher-level classes. Students should only request this after consulting with an academic adviser.\"\n\n3. Just take 112-Z. It is the freshman only version of 112 where the topics are slightly rearranged and where they review some 111 integration concepts.  It'll also be easier to make friends and stuff in it.\n\nAccording to what you listed you should be at your maximum (12 hours).",

Now is a solid time to major in it as the new curric. are now pretty well developed and now offers plenty of electives (way more than it had under the old one when I went).  Now-a-days there are enough electives to basically sort of make your own concentration in things like organic, physical/theoretical, and biochemistry (at least when coupled with 2-3 upper division biology courses like cell, genetics, and RNA bio)",
