  "text": "Hey guys, I was admitted as a Spring Admit to Oxford. I am starting to strongly consider Oxford as May 1st approaches. However, there is no financial aid info available to me about how much I'd have to pay. I'm currently choosing between USC and Oxford, but there's no real choice if I don't know what I'll be paying lol\n\nI emailed financial aid today, but was hoping someone in a similar position might know more than I do. Thanks in advance!",

There is a ba/msph for biostatistics and a bs/mph for environmental health. With that being said the human health major has a lot of elements of public health with just slightly more actual bio concepts instead of just policy. The human health/economics joint major consists primarily of policy tho.",
