  "text": "Hi All,\n\nI'm a rising senior in the ECA&S, and like the genius I am I saved my SNT w/ Lab gen ed requirement for my senior year. I am trying to get this requirement out of the way with as minimal interference as possible so I can focus on my actually important classes. Which labs would you recommend as having low time commitments and fair/easy grading?\n\nCurrently I'm considering these below but I'm open to others:\n\n1. BIOL 120: Concepts In Biology W/Lab\n2. PHYS 116: Intro Astronomy W/Lab\n3. ANT 201: Concepts And Methods in Biol Anth",

      "text": "Not too sure about ANT 201 but BIOL 120 and PHYS 116 are pretty manageable in terms of workload, idt you could go wrong with either of those classes for the requirement, so maybe whichever one seems more interesting/fits your schedule best, but yeah can\u2019t go wrong with either of those.",
