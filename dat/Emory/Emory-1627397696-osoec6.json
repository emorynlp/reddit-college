  "text": "Hi yall incoming freshman here\n\nHow does this schedule look?\n\nI'm currently interested in the BBA program and also the QSS major(maybe BBA+QSS lol). \n\nRight now I think this schedule seems bit too simple, so should I add one more class like QTM 110? Or is the workload just fine?\n\nBtw I kinda have to take engrd 101 :(\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/psjmp8mlqrd71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=f193862c2f96c886480fbabdc828023688f26ba9",

Honestly.\n\nIf you want to add QTM 110 and don\u2019t mind some extra work you definitely can. You could also swap QTM for your freshman seminar or engrd 101 and take one or the other next semester if you want a balanced schedule and want to focus on adjusting to academics/social stuff.",

          "text": "100 won't do them any good if considering the QTM major other than adding unnecessary stress and busy work in exchange for no advancement towards the major and it doesn't really build skills needed for the major as it is just a super basic stats course.  150 or 110 actually count towards those QTM concentrations.",
