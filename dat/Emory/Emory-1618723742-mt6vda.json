  "text": "hi all!! I'm a current pre-bba freshman and i am completely done with my pre recs for the goizueta application, so i've got a semester to kill to take some fun classes that are genuinely interesting to me before i apply early. I would love to hear your typical \"liberal arts-y\" classes at emory that would fill some gen eds along the way. I was thinking about taking death and dying with laderman, but that's just one idea - i am looking for some classes that are genuinely thought provoking and could expand my mindset, learn about something crazy, or just have some fun!",

      "text": "* ANT 334 (Evolutionary Medicine): No prerequisite course that reframes your perspective on disease and human evolution. Anyone can come in and learn new stuff. SNT gen ed.\n* ANT 101 (Introduction to Anthropology): HSC gen ed, fairly relaxed and could be an easy A, the same person that teaches ANT 334 will be teaching it this fall.\n* REL 270 (Sacred Drugs): HAP gen ed, pretty popular class. You can skate through with an easy A or actually put in the time to learn something.\n* IDS 200W (Interdisciplinary Foundations): HAPW gen ed, requires ENGRD 223 (Rhetorical Grammar) so it's actually 5 credits if you never took the grammar course before. Can't go wrong, the professor is well-received. Get a writing requirement out of the way I guess?",
