  "text": "I've been trying to upload my vaccination card to the HOME Health Portal and have encountered some difficulties. Whenever I press the link to the site and log in to where I'm supposed to send the vaccination card, I get a message that says \"Unable to load Homepage 'DEFAULT\\_LP'. The site is constantly loading, and I am unable to access it. Apparently this is due by July 1, so I was wondering if anyone else had similar issues. \n\nThank You!",

Should be the same page.\n\nAfter logging in, you get prompted to enter your date of birth. Then there's a blue button that says \"Enter my COVID-19 Vaccine Information.\"",
