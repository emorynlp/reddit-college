              "text": "Just review the 202 ochem because Exam 1 usually emphasizes some of those reactions. The main difference is how centered MO theory is in 203.  That would be a pain to teach yourself at a high level but at least having a basic recollection of key 202 reactions is a start.",

                      "text": "202 is NOT designed to emphasize that anyway. They just gave you a taste.  203 will do a more rigorous treatment of them to help better understand the reactions that you basically memorized in 202 so that you can extrapolate to figure out reaction mechanisms that weren't/aren't explicitly taught in class or put in practice materials.  202 was sort of about knowing \"stuff\" and the very basics of specific reactions so just focus on reviewing those reactions, the products that form, and the simpler mechanistic reasoning you learned. No biggie on the MO thing. It gets reviewed and reframed in depth.  What would be most problematic is if you forgot all the mechanisms because then you have to relearn all of that and then try to understand orbitals for them and newer reactions at the same time.  The whole point of 203 is to migrate y'all from basic memorization and pattern recognition in organic reactivity to more reasoning and mechanistically focused problem solving.",
