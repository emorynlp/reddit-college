  "text": "Hi! I'm a rising sophomore and I'm planning to take BIOL 336 Human Physiology and CHEM 203 Advanced Reactivity next year -- the former is located at 1462 Clifton Rd 230 and the latter White Hall 206. They occur consecutively, so I'll only have a 15-minute intermission between them, and the walk between the two classes seems to be 15 minutes also, according to Google maps. I can only imagine that I'll be late for my second class on more than one occasion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShould I try to rearrange my schedule such that travel distances are closer between classes or there is a longer intermission between two classes? If I do this, I most likely won't have my optimal schedule. Do professors even care (the second professor is Cafferty btw) if we're like up to 5 minutes late? What should I do? I know this is sort of a petty issue and is being asked a little too early, but it's been gnawing at the back of my mind for a while.",

      "text": "I have the same issue for two of my classes. I walked the distance and timed myself, and made it in 8 minutes. But it was definitely a fast walk, and I can imagine in the heat it would be painful and I'm not sure I could make it if it was pouring rain, so I ended up changing a few things as I don't like being late to things. But it just comes down to your preferences.",

He definitely called me out on it once or twice...\n\nThat being said, if you go quickly, I feel like 15 minutes should be ~just~ enough time to get from one to another",

It is extremely relevant for the MCAT and medical school. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the 15 minute gap. I\u2019ve had to make the trek on multiple occasions and if you walk briskly it can take about 10 minutes.",

          "text": "That class can be taught better(especially considering I've seen the versions of physiology taught at GSU which seem as if they should be taught to an Emory calibre crowd as well), and I feel like it can be reserved RIGHT before(not a whole year or more) they are about to do MCAT prep or go to medical school so that it is actually FRESH for those experiences or to serve as a later GPA pad.  It is not taught or tested in a way that leads to any longterm retention as nice of a guy as Cafferty is.  There are better classes in the biol department that will build high yield skills (and not just content knowledge) that are lasting that end up more beneficial (if only because many biology majors and pre-meds aren't taking courses that build these skills prior to MCAT prep.  I would be much more neutral if biol 141/142 had not been essentially murdered and we don't even wanna talk about the online Covid versions which were generally terrible.  Only 250 and 264 can repair the weak foundation people received from it).  That is at least my opinion on it.",

              "text": "I tend to disagree, even if OP doesn\u2019t retain everything from human phys, it\u2019s much easier to relearn the second time around when they\u2019re studying for the MCAT, and then even more reinforced by the time they get to med school. Repetition is the mother of all learning. In my experience, med school has been extremely laid back for me since I\u2019ve just been building on a lot of the knowledge from Cafferty\u2019s class. \n\nAs for evo bio, I thought that class was pretty much a joke. So much busy work and very little that I\u2019ve ever thought about since that class ended.",

                  "text": "It is, but why not start developing critical thinking skills in biology right away and save that for when they are about to start prepping is all I'm saying..\n\nAnd both are jokes (and especially if you took Real for evol), but at least evol emphasizes critical thinking and problem solving and the style of the tests are more in line with the MCAT STEM sections which are MOSTLY passages.  If you go into it knowing you are using it to learn to read literature, deal with real data, etc, you get something lasting out of evol AND probably a high grade. It's a win win.\n\n If you just view MCAT prep as gaining content knowledge (which it isn't) then something like evol will seem less useful.  Again I'd be for early 336 had biol 142 maintained its emphasis on experimental bio (so students already knew critical thinking in bio) but it doesn't do that anymore.  There are other classes that cover content on the MCAT like cell and genetics AND they emphasize the higher ordered skills so they are better than evol IMO but I get that people may be looking for ease with 203.",

Try filling it in with a different BIOL class and maybe that'll fit better. The whole walking thing is gonna take its toll, some days more than others (especially when it rains).\n\nLike the others said, it'll be a fast walk. I used to ruck march so I can make it consistently but it's not worth the hassle unless it's the only class available.",

          "text": "Well...you beat me to it.  I was just gone shut up lol.  If one is gonna take a mediocre biol class (or even a mediocre/weak teacher), why not evol. biol?  At least the general format of that course is useful to pre-meds(the time that would be spent memorizing labels of stuff and parts of pathways they'll forget by time they prep for the MCAT if a first semester sophomore in 336 would instead be redistributed to learning to read scientific literature  and/or doing a REAL problem set with authentic cases/data in 241) AND 241 probably has the same average or better than 336.  Plus it melds together several areas of biology really well to explain the bigger pic of evolution.  People under-estimate its usefulness because it doesn't sound \"pre-meddy\" or something.  Or perhaps they wanna go jog with Cafferty:[https://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/09/er\\_cafferty\\_runner/campus.html](https://news.emory.edu/stories/2016/09/er_cafferty_runner/campus.html)",

White Hall is only a little further so I think you'll be fine unless you're an extremely slow walker. Google Maps will map you along the street, which is definitely not the route you should take to get there quickly. If you take a path from White Hall up to the circle & past the freshman dorms to the bridge, I can't imagine that's more than a 10 minute walk.",
