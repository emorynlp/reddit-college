People get internships at all sorts of companies over the summer. There are plenty of companies in Atlanta as well that hire for interns during the school year. Emory is considered a target school for many companies, but the name won't get you anything if you don't do the work to prepare and apply.\n\nIf you look on LinkedIn, you can even see where current students and alumni are.",
