  "text": "I\u2019ve been applying to business related clubs for the past two semesters, but was unfortunately not able to get into any of them. I\u2019ve spent so much time of the applications and i\u2019ve applied to the same clubs both semesters and at this point i feel like i\u2019ve just been stressing myself out and wasting my time for nothing. At the same time I\u2019m panicking because I have no extracurriculars to report on my freshman year and I low key feel like none of the clubs want me. How can I build up my resume for the BBA application? Suggestions?",

There\u2019s a also a couple of clubs that don\u2019t require applications or the overarching umbrella orgs that you can participate in as a member. A lot of people join in sophomore year as well, so don\u2019t panic!!",

              "text": "Hey that\u2019s good! You\u2019ve already gotten to the resume round which is already most likely <20% of the applicants already. Interviewing is a skill that you have to practice to be good at (especially since you will have to do this for your career). I would start with being familiar with stuff on your resume. Think to yourself, what kind of questions or elaborations would they want/care about. A lot of people think they can improvise an answe (hint: they can\u2019t). It really takes time to practice formulating the right answer to even sound \u201cconfident\u201d. Start by looking int the STAR method. Also, look up common behavioral interview questions amd practice answering those with a friend or family member.\n\nFinally, sometimes you can practice all you want, but sometimes you just get unlucky, don\u2019t let that get you down.\n\nThe career center also provides mock interviews which help you get better at speaking to people you are not familiar with. Plus they can give more specific feedback!!",

Like their acceptance rate is pretty high so wouldn\u2019t you still have a good shot at getting in as long as you do well in the pre-reqs and are involved in SOME type(s) of extracurricular activities? Other than that there should be some business clubs where being a member doesn\u2019t require an application",
