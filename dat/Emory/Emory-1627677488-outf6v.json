  "title:": "Lil question about Freshman Seminars",
  "text": "Looking to be a psychology and linguistics joint major. Currently interested in MUS 190 for my Freshman Seminar but with how my schedule is currently formatted it means that I'm taking 3 classes in a row from 8:30 to around 1 PM, with MUS 190 sandwiched in the middle. I was wondering if this was at all doable and not signing up for months of torture.\n\nOther seminars I was looking at include SOC 190 (Sociology of Conservatism), PHIL 190, and NBB 190. IDK, what do y'all think? Should I maybe switch out to one of the other ones? \n\nThanks everyone!",

              "text": "It\u2019s a discussion based polisci class, you basically read some of the founding documents and great conservative thinkers and try and understand their perspective. The reason it is so great is because of lechner though - he\u2019s a genuinely amazing person with a real commitment to free speech and critical thinking.",

      "text": "I highly recommend taking a sociology class at some point! I'm a double major in Sociology and NBB and love both; however, I cannot speak to either NBB professor for the seminars. That being said, I tried my first year to take a seminar in the fall and all of the ones I wanted that fit into my schedule were gone by the time I got to sign up, but it worked out for the best because the spring seminar I took, MUS 190 (music of the Great Depression) was amazing! So don't panic if your seminars fill up before you get a chance to sign up. Definitely try to get feedback before you sign up though because some professors' seminars are interesting/fun/not too stressful while others are very intense.",

If you\u2019re interested, I say take it. Especially if the other seminars don\u2019t provide better time options",
