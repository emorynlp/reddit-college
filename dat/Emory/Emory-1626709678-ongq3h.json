My question is: do I have to do something or am I automatically enrolled? \n\nThank you :)",

      "text": "Ask the overseer of that program. It is probably something where the ECS 101 course for STEM Pathways has a specific number/section and/or a permission number.  That also sounds kind of new to integrate the program with any sort of course (even if just an orientation course), so they may not even know yet and may not be able to tell you what to do until the actual program, but you best bet is to ask.",
