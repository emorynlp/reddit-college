  "text": "Hi all, I was lucky enough to be admitted to both ECAS and Oxford yesterday, but even luckier to be selected as an Oxford Scholar Finalist. For any current scholars, or students that went through the process, I was wondering about how the scholar's interviews are run--were the interviews like traditional alumni interviews?--and how many of the scholar finalists actually become scholars.",

      "text": "Pretty sure oxford has \\~2 full-ride woodruff scholars a year and a few more full tuition scholars. They likely offer the scholarship to about 2X the number of students they want to attend, since (as you probably know) scholar finalists often have other competitive offers including merit scholarships to comparable private schools and Ivy admission. However, covid has changed yield calculations for schools so no promises it'll be the same this year. In the past, Oxford scholar interviews were individual (as opposed to group, like the Emory college scholars). I'd expect them to be more structured than a traditional alumni interview and with a wider scope of questions. \n\nMy (unsolicited) advice? Remember that the interviewers have read your resume, essays, and application, so try to show your personality and character in the interview, rather than just ennumerating your resume. Reflect on the Woodruff scholar qualities (assuming your aiming for the full ride) and think about how you have demonstrated them in the past and will strive to live them in college and beyond. The qualities, in case you aren't already aware, are forceful and unselfish character, motivation to enrich the lives of others at Emory and in the wider world, creativity and leadership, intellectual and personal vigor, outstanding academic achievement, and communication skills.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSource: [http://college.emory.edu/scholars/scholarships/scholar-qualities.html](http://college.emory.edu/scholars/scholarships/scholar-qualities.html)",

      "text": "Hello, current first year Oxford scholar so answering questions based off of last year. The other commenter was mostly right about the process but I will note that last year was pretty weird due to the sudden switch online. I\u2019m not sure exactly how the process will work this year but last year we had group and individual interviews over zoom. About 5-6 full-ride scholars are selected and a couple other scholarships are offered and the interview stages had about 15-20 people if I remember correctly?\n\nFeel free to dm any other questions you might have!",
