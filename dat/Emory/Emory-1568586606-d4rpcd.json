      "text": "If you ask 10 people, you'll get 10 answers, so here's my take.\n\nEmory has a reputation for being a place for Ivy rejects, and I guess that's technically true - a lot of people I've met here wanted to go to the likes of Harvard, Columbia, or Yale. But not one of them has said they regret coming to Emory. I think the difference is (and I've said this in several different posts) that Emory is competitive without being cutthroat. It's academically rigorous and students work/study hard, but few feel the need to sabotage others' work, or constantly compare themselves to others.\n\nI've heard some pretty gnarly stories out of Hopkins and Cornell, and every time I do I'm thankful I ended up here. I've had so much support from faculty, clubs, friends, and academic departments. The general feeling is that people want you to succeed, and if you look for help in the right places, you will. \n\nIt's anecdotal, but consider that memes on MemEmory complain about stuff like construction, the premed/prebusiness rivalry, and food. Compare that to UCB or Cornell's, which while funny, can be really depressing sometimes.\n\nIf you can, you should visit campus and tour around. That's the best way to get a feel for things, and it's how I clicked with the College. Best of luck and feel free to reach out with any questions.",

      "text": "I was a CS major but spent most of my time hanging out with humanities majors. Within that group at least I found it to be a really nice balance of smart and motivated while not being ego-driven or cut throat. People tend to be socially conscious (at least the people I hung around) and tend to be actively involved in their communities outside of just going to class and trying to get a job.\n\nOverall I I felt like the culture was academically rigorous without being cut throat. People take their studies seriously because they're smart and they care but most people are also pretty laid back and take time to smell the roses and enjoy life.\n\nThat being said I didn't really hang out with pre meds or business majors so there may be some selection bias on my part.",

          "text": "pre-meds seemed basically the same as what you described.  The pre-business folks too. They just tended to have a little more anxiety about academics for a myriad of reasons that are somewhat understandable.  People like to paint them as special groups socially when even academically, they don't differ outside of  aiming for specific post-grad plans.  I think if Emory had an engineering school, you could see creation of a sizeable sub-culture differing from our descriptions.  But Emory generally attracts the types described.",

      "text": "I know I'm a day late to this thread, but here it goes:\n\n- Emory has close to zero school spirit. None. The only time I have heard \"go Eagles\" on campus is when it's referring to the Philadelphia Eagles. I've never been to a sporting event here. Aside from the very few D3 athletes, students here are more the academic/striving-for-success type than they are spirited. \n\n- I feel like everyone says this about their school, but it is especially true at Emory: the people here are some of the nicest people you will meet in your life. My theory is that the admissions team goes out of their way to find people who value kindness, even if that means putting it before academics, which is something most top schools don't emphasize.\n\n- The party scene is very poor. My theory here is that many of the students didn't have much partying experience in high school, and therefore, don't really know how to party hard. Keep in mind, this does not apply to everyone here--just a higher percentage than at most schools.\n\n- Many times, you'll roll up to a college campus, and it's full of brick buildings from the 1800's/all this cool historic stuff. Emory is not like that. It looks a lot more corporate. Kinda like a tech company headquarters. Everything's very up-to-date and clean.\n\n- Students here are very focused when it comes to academics. They take it seriously. That being said, it never comes before kindness. Hence, there isn't really a culture of students comparing themselves or trying to sabotage others. If you ask a classmate for help, they will help you.",

          "text": "replace poly-sci with psyche, math, econ. , or QTM.  Actually looking at some data showing where major distribution is not as clustered as it used to be (used to be several as high as BBA, but they have all dropped and spread out).  Top 5 are bba, bio, nursing, econ, and psyche.  \n\nEcon. used to consistently be number 2, but I have to wonder if QTM is eating at its share.  In addition, all used to have equal to or more than 10% of the share of graduates.  Guess Emory is doing a little better in getting a more diverse range of majors.",
