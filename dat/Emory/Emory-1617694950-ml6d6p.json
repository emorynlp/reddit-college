      "text": "During the audition sign-up and process, you will have the chance to indicate your interest in joining a string quartet to the Department. The Music Department will handle organizing the quartet, including setting the membership and finding a coach for the group. Your music major status will not really play a role in this unless there is a surplus of violin players relative to cello players that limits the number of groups that they can form, in which case the majors will be prioritized, but that is not usually an issue. The Department and current students will also be able to assist you in deciding if the music major is right for you",
