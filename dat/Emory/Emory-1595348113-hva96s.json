      "text": "For me personally, I found that classes on the Atlanta campus had comparable difficulty to the ones on the Oxford campus. There wasn\u2019t a general trend of easier vs harder.\n\nIt was more difficult to transition into main campus, especially socially. If you don\u2019t have good friends from Oxford and you don\u2019t want to participate in Greek life, then it\u2019s hard to make friends and socialize.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to decide which campus is better. I think that both are pretty good and I\u2019m glad to have experienced both.",

      "text": "Keep in mind this was 15 years ago, but I found the transition to the Atlanta campus to be pretty easy.\n\nI kept up with my friends from Oxford but I also played a sport so I was able to make friends with \"Emory people\" as well.  Two of my roommates (from Oxford) joined a fraternity/sorority and I made friends that way too.  I will say that I did find some judgement from \"Emory people\" when they found out I went to Oxford.  Not sure if that's still a thing. \n\nClass-wise, I think they were about the same difficulty... but classes can be much larger at Emory.  I think 2 years is just enough time until Oxford gets old.  I am still very glad I did both, I loved my experience at each campus!",

      "text": "Whether or not classes are more difficult between campuses varies based on major and professor. In my own experience (I\u2019m majoring in biology), there was a difference in the classes I took but not necessarily in the difficulty of the content. I did notice that my Oxford classes often had more assignments (i.e. papers, hand-written assignments, projects).\n\nI think the difficulty of transition is very personal and unique. Admittedly, I did not try very hard to integrate into the Atlanta campus's culture; however, I also felt like I had an easy transition because I lived with a close group of Oxford friends. While I made acquaintances with new people in my classes, I was so busy with other things and already had my Oxford support group that I didn't feel short on friends or in need to reach out too much; however, if you feel as though you don't have a solid network from Oxford you'll have to put in some effort to branch out and meet people. I imagine it's close in experience to transferring in from another university except you'll know/recognize more people off the bat.\n\nI\u2019m pretty introverted and I actually enjoyed my time at Oxford very much. The convenience of waking up at 9:45 for a 10 am class was sorely missed when I came to Atlanta and the proximity of all my friends was nice. I liked that my bio classes were smaller and I had better relationships with those professors. While I definitely appreciate having easier access to the city and would not want to return to Oxford, I think I will always have a soft spot for Ox; I am glad I went and had my two years, but that chapter of my life has closed. The Atlanta campus is more impersonal but has more opportunities and people. Overall I think both campuses offer a unique experience and I\u2019m glad I got some of both.",
