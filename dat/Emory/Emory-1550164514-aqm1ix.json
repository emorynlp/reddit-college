I don\u2019t want to go into oxford college expecting the best but then getting less Than i accounted for. I need the most honest, brutal comments/criticisms about Oxford so I can be better prepared tor next year",

There is a ton of stuff to do on campus, but there isn't much to do off-campus in the Oxford area, especially if you don't have a car.  Classes are really hard.  Like, depending on what you're studying they're probably going to be more work that you're expecting, but by comparison, your junior and senior years will feel easy.\n\nThat's about all I've got.  People will find shit to complain about literally anywhere, but my list of complaints about Oxford is really small.",

Unlike what the other commenter said, while Oxford does have clubs and you can make yourself busy during the day, going out to clubs/bars/frats is a pain in the ass because it involves driving an hour to and from atl. \n\nOn the flip side, the academics are unparalleled and the top of Emory\u2019s graduating class is mostly Oxford students.

There isn't a nightlife scene in Covington at all, so you do have to go to Atlanta for bars, clubs, house parties etc. which can be a real hassle, but is part of the experience.  That said, looking back now, getting drunk in our Oxford dorm and getting into trouble around campus was a lot more fun than almost any night out at a bar anyway, so I don't think we were really missing out.  And then we were easily able to do all of those things our junior and senior years.\n\nI would NOT agree that Oxford isn't a place where you can socialize and have fun, unless it's changed a hell of lot more than I thought.  We had a blast, but our fun wasn't solely limited to drinking at a bar or club, so ymmv",

          "text": "There is no evidence that the \"top\" of Emory's graduating class is mostly Oxford students.  Usually 3900-4200 graduate from Emory undergraduate each year.  Even if I take the top 10%, that leaves 390 people (and Emory only awards honors based upon a thesis...so you would only have PBK left to figure this out and I suspect that ECAS and GBS folks who started on main are still the solid majority).  ECAS and GBS are just too large for Oxford to dominate in that arena (plus freshman GPAs at Emory are supposedly much higher meaning ECAS/GBS students get a head start).  What is fairer to say is that, Oxford students are pretty well represented among the top of whatever department and have definitely had success earning top graduation prizes (which take academics into account) awarded by Emory.  \n\nThey also are a bit more diverse career trajectory wise.  In particular, Oxford has produced some great scientists and other future academics who went on to pursue PhDs which is lesser so what kids on main want to do (To keep students interested in these career paths versus a pre-professional pathway, it suggests that teaching at Oxford was inspiring enough to make students want to become academics in that field which is hard to do considering the lure of higher pay from elsewhere) which is a great thing.\n\nI just don't like to speculate about relative academic performance (at least in terms of grades) because there is just little evidence, and nor does any of it matter when you have significant chunks from each doing honors theses.  Worrying about the \"Top of the class\"  (something not measured as Emory, from what I remember does not award a Valedictorian for undergraduate units) suggests that Emory cares more about grades (which can be obtained through careful course and instructor selection whether you started at Oxford or ECAS) which  of success, which it actually more so values contribution to scholarship/scholarly activities (many peer schools on the other hand do award Latin honors and departmental awards based soley on GPA cut-offs, whereas Emory just doesn't have that.  If you have a 3.5+, you can do an honors thesis).   Both campuses do a great job with that and arguably Oxford over-performs I guess.",

                  "text": "Yeah, but they are into marketing like anywhere else.  It would be in their interest to be hyperbolic when they are marketing.   I would want to convince folks that it is worth it to attend Oxford as most students end up very prepared for ECAS.  The last Oxford strategic planning document I read which was out about 2-3 years ago featured them celebrating the fact the that Oxford students had finally narrowed the achievement gap between them and students who began at ECAS.  They made it the basis of them being able to change their gen. eds (which they will beginning next incoming cohort now. they mentioned how they essentially mimicked ECAS's curriculum to gain the trust of parents and ECAS/GBS administrators...so there was a gap that maybe didn't disappear until 5-10 years ago as Oxford's incoming metrics started to converge with ECAS): http://oxford.emory.edu/academics/educational-experience/gep.html\n\nIf you want to know more for whatever reason, just let me know, and I will just PM you the document (the full strategic plan).  Either way, I was a STEM major and can vouch for the sharpness of a lot of the top Oxford students in my classes.  It's just that there were so many of really sharp and high GPA students among us (those who started at ECAS) to match.  Again, the achievement of students at Emory would not be decided by GPA simply because there are too many people who will have high GPAs.  Dean's list which is often the top quintile or quartile per class at Emory is often over 3.85!  I mean, 3.85+ GPAs just aren't that different and differences may be determined by who dodges very challenging instructors when at ECAS and who doesn't and   I've seen Oxford students do it just as much dodging as ECAS students especially in STEM. \n In fact, I had been told by Ox friends that some Ox faculty straight up advised against certain Emory STEM instructors because they were unusually challenging. It had an effect as a vast majority of say, Dr. Weinschenk for organic would be populated by ECAS students and a sprinkling of ambitious Ox students (who would opt for instructors perceived as easier.  I remember when Dr. Menger, a complete joke, taught it, and the majority of his 70 or so person class would be populated by Oxford students.  Scarborough, when at Emory, another joke, also had disproportionate amounts though not a majority like in Menger.  I found these patterns striking and it explained why many would claim \"I found Emory easier\".  Well yeah, ECAS has more choice in class and instructor selection, so of course it is easier to choose ease especially if you have the same insider knowledge ECAS students have.  You go through the rough Ox curric. and then you take advantage of ECAS and \"balance\" your schedule more.  It makes sense).  If a Weinschenk gives 16-20% A grades (A/A- combined) out to each cohort, the majority of them will by virtue of the ECAS bias, go to ECAS students. \n\n A better metric might be who did research good enough to get them highest honors (Summa Cum Laude) from their department, and I honestly just have no clue.  But either way, don't trust any \"stats\" from an admissions office unless they are willing to advertise them in their entirety on the admissions website.",

Because we all know admissions to elite schools is solely based on how \"smart\" you are.   Can't get behind you on this.  Don't get on here and judge anybody's \"smartness\" by what school they were admitted to or not.  In this admissions environment, it is ludicrous to say what you just said.  It is like idiots who say things like: \"You didn't get into X elite school because you didn't deserve to\".  Often that is not the case.  Usually its because \"it didn't have enough room for all the people who  deserved to get in, so they had to go somewhere else really good\" or \"the adcom was having a bad day or became bored upon reaching your applications\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo argue over perceptions of intelligence and admissions is silly and petty especially when you compare Emory to Oxford which are negligibly different stats wise if that is the only thing you view as measuring \"smarts\" which is just ridiculous.  Hopefully ECAS taught you better than to do what you are doing now.  It isn't cool.",

Your publication was WAY more important and indicative of your ambition and level of intelligence than a GPA or your ACT (which hardly matters if you take good classes in college).  Also, to be blunt, unless it is a top 10, non-Penn Ivy, I don't value the Ivies much more than Emory.  \"Ivy\" should not be thrown around like it is a monolith to slight or impress other people.  But the general sentiment you express, I agree with.  I met fools at ECAS (mind you I started there so don't have an Ox bias) who said things like: \"Georgia Tech can't be rigorous because it's a public school\" or \"Berkeley is a private school\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery silly elitism that I am sure is pretty at plenty of the other elite schools and Ivies.  In no way would elitism on main get me to transfer away to an Ivy League (maybe unless it is Cornell which gives more a \"working class\" vibe because of the engineering presence and the general focus on practicality).  The only reason one should transfer is based on other issues of academic and social fit, but going to an Ivy or other elite will NEVER solve the elitism problem if that is ever the problem (if anything, outside of social fit, people tend to transfer to another elite for no other reason than prestige sadly).  Much worse exists elsewhere.  If anything, Emory's is much more dialed back and based upon a bunch of non-sense that always made me just shrug my shoulders instead of getting upset about it.  People at elite schools have book smarts and can circle answers on multiple choice tests really well, but some can't think critically so project an elitism that is based in ignorance.  If I was bothered by it enough, I would have transferred to an HBCU or public honors program (though publics are so expensive today that lots of them have it to), not an Ivy.  My solution to feeling inferior or left out in some way would not to be in an environment where everyone including myself could officially thumb their noses up at others.  It would be to go where I can get a great education and have my own and others humility as an acceptable social norm.  There are so many schools outside of the elite LACs and research universities that allow for this.",

If you read the long and detailed post I wrote, it mainly had to do with moldy dorms which are a health hazard, no access to resources as everything was in a Atlanta and not Oxford, and lack of just overall opportunities. Further, the only reason I pointed to test scores is because they are posted by admissions and are generally the first point of reference when people at Emory point to Oxford students as \u201cnot as smart\u201d like OP has done. In reality, there were many students at Oxford with passion and intellect, but unfortunately about 1/3 graduate early and a good handful like myself transfer because we were tired of being excluded from all Emory had to offer.

Emory is a great institution and I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve loved it if I chose to start at main (many of my friends did and they are happy), but the disconnect at Oxford, which is supposed to be part of Emory but got no where near the same amount of attention as ECAS, was disappointing.

                          "text": "I had no intention of complaining about the other stuff you said.  I get all that.  I guess I am somewhat less sympathetic only because I think people should understand that Oxford is an LAC like environment that feeds into the research university style environment of ECAS.  Given that Oxford does not have the endowment (each Emory unit has an endowment) comparable to ECAS or even other elite and less elite LACs, I suppose I would just expect that it would have certain weaknesses outside of the academics (which I don't view as a weakness).  \n\nMy assumption was that the Oxford concept was more in favor of academic grounding and \"home grown\" experiential opps anyway.  I never looked at its locations and offerings and expected it to offer the same experience as ECAS or even elite LACs which, although often rural, are even closer to the urban core of the nearby metropolitan area than Oxford is to Atlanta (Williams and Swarthmore are such examples).  Although I can imagine it is somewhat disappointing since Em and Ox are marketed as so intricately tied together academically, which they kind of are, except if you immediately want access to opportunities that are usually taken advantage of at earlier points in the undergraduate career, Ox maybe doesn't make it as easy.\n\n\nAs for dorms and stuff...I never care to discuss this issue (caring too much about accomodations likely helps facilitate the runaway costs at ALL residential colleges).  Public schools (elites and those on the cusp or with well-known honors colleges) were the first to go crazy emphasize accommodations and dorm quality to attract students.  Privates (especially the elites) were mostly known for the academics and other types of amenities but historically had raggedy or not so great dorms for quite a while.  It took a while for most (especially Ivies and even Stanford) to get on board with renovations and all that stuff.  Most private school dorms conjure up Hogwartz or something on the outside and maybe even via a dining hall (in the case of residential style colleges), but in terms of the rooms and hallways, I never expected much from any of them.  Any private school throwing up a bunch of new dorms (like Emory did post-2007 as well as others), I kind of viewed with skepticism, but then they all started doing it (perhaps because publics were luring away talent with honors dorms and the like).  But most \"new Ivies\" like Emory, WUSTL, and Vanderbilt were the first to do that type of thing.  When I arrived at Emory (I'm older), McTrimble still existed and  it had mold and stuff.  It is kind of sad, but I heard worse stories from other elite privates or at least that truly trash dorms were more frequent.  \n\nI don't know about any social scene either.  That is always what you make of it.  At a small school in a rural area, it might get stale quickly.  I think people have to do more research before applying to schools.  What many high achievers do is look at ways to get to or closely associate themselves with the top ranked schools without even considering some of the details which may actually end up being important.  Hell, I am actually still surprised at how academically different some of the elite schools are from each other, yet most 17-19 year olds just think \"oh its highly ranked in USNWR so I'll take for granted that it will be good and rigorous in whatever I want to study.  Furthermore, I will be stupid and assume that the rankings cleanly correlate with overall academic quality\" (in reality, students should consider the range of academic interests they have and probably go to places that excel at undergraduate teaching and providing opportunity in those areas).  I've been there and done that, and then did the research that reveals to myself how naive and surface level I was when applying to college (as well as how silly some of my fellow ECAS cohort members were when evaluating the quality of a school and their experience relative to peer schools.  You find many were just ignorant or super petty).  \n\nAs a former STEM major (and now grad. student), I still find it laughable that some folks at Emory and beyond think that certain higher ranked schools (that were not higher ranked when I attended Emory) are better for their STEM field of interest at the undergraduate level in terms of teaching, research, or anything else in the area simply because the schools are higher ranked (in reality, one can do the research and figure this out to some extent.  There are even many course websites that pop up via a Google search for some schools.  Some schools invest in curriculum change and some don't and that is often available on the website of agencies that give the grants and usually the schools use their own media to publicize when they are making such changes.  One can go take one look at the Undergraduate research websites of each school and look at the organization of the website as well how robust the programmatic offerings are to get an idea of how serious the school is about funneling students into said opportunities.  But oh well, it is just so much easier to listen to friends and read USNWR rankings even though it is the next 4 years of your life).  \n\nSTEM at certain schools is just complete trash across several departments, so all I can do is laugh at folks with these silly ideas, and in the case of some Emory students, self-denigration (that is why some ECAS students like to pick on Ox students.  It really is just an escape hatch because they aren't confident enough in themselves and their own situation to compare their experiences to those at peer schools.  They ignorantly believe all of them are better based upon superficial metrics, so they find an unranked \"little guy\" like Oxford and other public schools to pick on.  It an be bad at Emory, but others at similar tiered non-Ivy elites also have their special ways of expressing insecurity.  Usually they do so by being almost annoyingly over-confident in how much different they are than slightly less ranked schools when they are the same or worse).",

                  "text": "That is believable.  Physics is very good at Oxford from my understanding (the introductory options because of their size and the fact that it uses teaching faculty get to be top notch).  However, like I mentioned, Summa cum laude is based on the honors thesis.  So her classes and GPA once it is above 3.5 doesn't matter.  Physics is not an \"elite\" undergraduate program at ECAS and not many people major in it (it isn't that rigorous because teaching in the physics department is not a top priority at Emory.  Their research is.  In addition, it is so unpopular that about 3 years ago, they had to break it up into several concentrations and majors as a desperate attempt to attract life sciences and pre-engineering students to the physics department).\n\nIf Oxford has good teaching in physics, it may \"feed\" the physics undergraduate program (most people I knew at ECAS who majored, actually double majored and typically did an interdisciplinary honors thesis or research projects via another department because those departments were better at creating an affinity towards them through their coursework, robust set of special events, and advising/general undergraduate support).  An article done in the Emory magazine suggests this is the case.  For STEM, ECAS's sweet spots are chemistry (chemistry at ECAS is generally a different animal in terms of the level of problem solving and thinking required in tests and assignments in the lecture components of key courses.  However, it is still possible to do well as many of the instructors are hard enough to have to apply a curve.  On the other hand , to no surprise, labs are better and more interesting at Oxford because it's smaller), biology (most biology follow the intro. biology at Oxford and are research oriented, but there are some intermediate classes heavily frequented by Em and Ox pre-meds that are still straight lecture and memorization oriented like.....Oxford's upper division elective offerings to bio majors minus the lab components of course), and neuroscience (the way any one person completes the NBB major is mostly dependent upon the electives which give broad options throughout several departments.  Cores are kind of challenging, but generally one NBB major will have a dramatically different experience from another overall.  I imagine for example, that a student who chooses electives hosted in chem, bio, NBB and/or even psyche would experience much more challenge than one who mostly takes courses cross-listed with or hosted by anthropology), and to some degree math and QTM (this may just be hard, but at least they teach you how to do really useful things that can be immediately applied).  Those have a lot more quality control (though there are still questionable instructors if you don't want your classes to challenge you in the right way.  It's just that most courses in these departments will require a decent amount of analytical thinking to succeed.  Physics is watered down versus what it is supposed to be from my understanding.  They likely want to retain majors.  The others don't have this problem and may actually be too big).",

You have to plan out going out hours in advance if you want to go to Atlanta. You can't spontaneously go out or get a nice dinner or go to mags on a whim. \n\nThey also advertise Emory and Oxford as having the same resources but it's simply not true. There is no pre-health advising here and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I thought I would at least get good academic advising but my academic advisor does not know anything and if I ask him questions, he just says to ask a second-year student because he doesn't know the answers. \n\nAlso I had to live in a study lounge for first semester because they over-enrolled students and didn't have enough dorms for everyone. Also the JRC is dirty and a couple of my friends have gotten sick due to the mold and have had to move out into a study lounge/dorm classroom. \n\nI also rushed a sorority and you're automatically at a disadvantage during the rush process if you go to Oxford. There is a weird stigma around Oxford people and the conversation shifts when they discover you go to Oxford. It's harder to get into a sorority if you go to Oxford. \n\nAlso, if you rush a pre-professional frat like AKPsi they will not take you simply because you go to Oxford, and the same is with some other organizations. \n\nIf you do go to Oxford I recommend getting a car because a lot of the resources and internships are in ATL.",

Seriously, think about some of the negative things that result from being in a small, rural setting at a school with a small population.  Hell, depending on your career track and educational values, small classes can be bad because it usually increases the workload and the difficulty of graded assignments and tests. You can go find people complaining about Oxford usually expressing similar sentiments to those who go to say Georgia Tech.  Imagine it being a \"grind school\", but with the social atmosphere of somewhere WAY smaller (not maybe 1/14 the size) than GT.  That is how some depict it, and all of that usually informs the complaints and concerns of current students.  I would also imagine the course selection options may be an issue, especially if you want to accelerate faster than other students.",

      "text": "I will probably provide the most honest review, no bs but again completely based on my experience. I hated Oxford College and I transferred after my first year for a multitude of reasons.\n\n1. Dorms, specifically the JRC which houses the most students, sucks. There is mold and humidity within the dorms, and workers have had to evacuate rooms to perform treatments and forcing students to live with friends for several nights. I\u2019ve had to buy a dehumidifier with my own money despite the ridiculous amount of tuition at Oxford. I\u2019ve had mold growing on my clothing and towels. On top of it all, I had bronchitis and paid $300 for a chest x-ray which determined the cause as inhalation of mold spores. Finally, the incompetent administration does nothing for the students and their response is they have a \u201c5 year plan to take down the dorm\u201d but that doesn\u2019t affect me whatsoever as I will not be here in 5 years. This is my far the worst dorm and it makes Dobbs (worst Emory dorm) seem like a paradise.\n\n2. Lack of advising and pre-professional career offices, while they advertise as having \u201cgreat one-on-one advising\u201d. There is no pre-health advising office at Oxford, while there is one at Emory; we pay roughly the same in tuition but have no where near the same resources. There is no business advising either. The woman who reads BBA apps visited Oxford once during the entire fall semester, while she visits each individual dorm at Emory, has cookie chats with Emory BBAs and has drop-in hours. Career services is a joke as it is literally one woman in a side office of the Student Health Services. She would be booked for 2 weeks in advice, especially when I needed to urgently discuss class election and she doesn\u2019t work on Fridays. You really want me to get career advice from someone who doesn\u2019t work a 9-5 M-F job? Like with the 70k tuition I pay, and you hired one career advisor for nearly 1000 students (I thought this was ridiculous).\n\n3. Social stigma associated with Oxford \nMany students on main campus view Oxford students as stupid, unmotivated and inferior to Emory because \u201cthey couldn\u2019t get into main campus\u201d. This especially permeates Greek life and social scenes like bars and clubs. I had many friends at main campus from my hs and as they introduced me to their new friends from Emory, the reaction I got was \u201cOh you go to Oxford, I heard it sucks\u201d. Yes, it does but I hated how that was used as a conversation point when we were supposed to be out having fun. Additionally everything is so much harder to reach because of the 2 hour drive there and back. If you\u2019re someone who likes going out, be prepared to spend a ton of money on Uber so you can travel from buttfuck GA to see some ounce of civilization in Atlanta. Oh, and if you plan on rushing Greek life, don\u2019t expect much as they don\u2019t want to take Oxford students. \n\n4. No internship fairs or networking opportunities \nLiterally every single internship fair is located at Emory\u2019s main campus, so you\u2019d have to drive an hour to get access to resources that you\u2019re paying for.\n\n5. Food is absolute trash \nYou will get bored from the same rotation of scrambled eggs, sweet potato, and turkey sausage every morning. When compared to the DUC at main campus, the DUC offeres more options and they have really delicious omelets. On top of that you have Kaldi\u2019s, Cox hall with places like Twisted Taco and Maru to to get dinner at and they accept the Dooley Dollars which are part of the meal plan. I did not have any of that at Oxford, and I was always envious of my friends at main campus because they didn\u2019t realize how lucky they were for simply having options. Also, they have Emory Village within walking distance which has Chipotle; the nearest Chipotle to Oxford was a 20 minute drive.\n\n6.  Non-legitimate clubs \nOne of the biggest selling points of Oxford was leadership opportunities, which is true if you wanted to be president of \u201cpsych club\u201d or \u201cbusiness club\u201d but you will have a difficult time getting leadership positions at main campus because you\u2019re coming in as a junior. I say non-legit clubs because main campus has an actual investment fund club, consulting club, impact investing club, entrepreneurship club and more which are producing tangible reports, working with real money and business ventures and getting to grow as professionals. Furthermore, it\u2019s hard to join these clubs even when you are at Emory because you\u2019re coming in as a nobody while other students have been members since there freshman year and have formed connections simply from being at the same school. The clubs at Oxford just have general body meetings, making it much more equitable to high school than worthwhile college experiences.\n\n7. Isolated \nI\u2019m a social person who likes going out and the entire atmosphere was isolating and depressing. If you want to go to restaurants, shopping or bars, it is all in Atlanta. \n\n8. Uncooperative administration \nStudents recently complained how their parking spots were turned into visitor parking, so students with cars who paid for parking passes no longer have access to those spots. Let me see some facts and figure about how many visitors Oxford gets because it\u2019s nothing. Those lots stay empty. Kids from main campus don\u2019t even visit Oxford, so the administration is completely kidding themselves if they believe they\u2019re getting copious amounts of visitors.\n\n9. Immature and Unmotivated students \nMany students at Oxford came because they simply are not ready for an actual college. Classes are about a 5 minute walking period and there is an attendance policy for most classes which makes it a glorified high school than a college. Furthermore, from my perspective as a business student, there simply is no comparison between Oxford and main campus business students. Although there were few who were motivated, looked for opportunities, did internships and had high achievement in their classes at Oxford, this is the expectation rather than the exception for pre-business students at main campus. Many were much more motivated (on account of having legit investing and business clubs) and knowledgeable because they got to directly interact with the BBA advisor and the older students who were currently in the B school.\n\n10. The void you feel while attending Oxford. \nThe majority of the student body lives in a state of anticipation as they can\u2019t wait to get to main campus. I felt like I was throwing half of my undergrad experience away, and I was surrounded my people with similar sentiments as my ow resulting in an overall lack of spirit and joy on campus. \n\nOverall, I did not enjoy my time at Oxford for the reasons outlined above and I am much happier at my current institution. Hopefully you have a smoother time than I did. \n",

Most people seem to dislike it here. Even though they don\u2019t directly state it, their dissatisfaction with Oxford becomes evident when the clearance section in the campus bookstore is filled to the brim with Oxford spirit gear. The grand majority of students tend to only wear clothing that has the Emory name printed on them. Most students will avoid mentioning that they go to Oxford on their Facebook and Instagram pages, too. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the social stigma attached to Oxford causes people to avoid associating themselves with the school, but it nonetheless indicates the amount of pride (or lack thereof) its own students have for it. In general, complaining about Oxford has pretty much become a normalized activity on campus. It\u2019s typical for Oxford students to bond over complaining about the rural location, difficult classes, small student body, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that many students overload on classes and graduate a semester early from Oxford simply because they don\u2019t want to be here. It\u2019s gotten to the point where administration has to constantly adjust its graduation requirements and give students incentives for staying on Oxford\u2019s campus all four semesters. Almost all of the major leadership positions on campus require you to remain at Oxford for the entirety of your sophomore year, for instance. Kids who received merit scholarships from Oxford are also required to remain there for two years in order to remain eligible for them. Except the administration\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t working\u2026at all. Last month, \u2153 of the sophomores graduated a semester early.\n\nEven though there are clearly some cons to attending Oxford, it\u2019s still a decent school that has superb academic opportunities and equally wonderful professors who care about you. I\u2019m hesitant to call it a bad college, since everyone has different opinions on what constitutes a good one. I consider it to be more niche than anything else. The truth is that most 18-20 year olds want a more \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience (and there's nothing wrong with that). They want to live in a vibrant city, be apart of a large student body, and easily access parties and other fun activities. Oxford is a far cry from all of that. It\u2019s isolated, small, and there\u2019s not much to do here except study. Oxford isn\u2019t a bad school; it just doesn't offer what most college students are looking for in an institution.",

People should go into Oxford like it is an LAC version of ECAS or else they'll just be \"doing time\" until they get to ECAS where they won't get school spirit, but they'll get access to other things that a larger school would have that could compensate for the lack of traditional \"spirit\".",

              "text": "If people graduate early, it suggests that the curriculum is not compelling enough to keep students there for both years, so I don't blame them for changing it.  Another reason they want to change it to be more demanding is because the current curriculum is too much like ECAS even though Oxford doesn't have an ECAS vibe.  This means that students come in thinking it is just like ECAS and that they can, again, just \"do time\" at Ox and continue on to ECAS.  Oxford is basically an LAC yet draws a HUGE percent of pre-professionals like ECAS.  Most pre-health and pre-BBA students would have been better off starting at ECAS or another school altogether.  If they change the curriculum to more \"serious\" (addition of the Discovery Seminar, and the \"milestone project\") and different from ECAS, perhaps they can change the recruitment patterns (this would require much more effective marketing IMHO.  In addition, even ECAS and the Arts and Sciences units of several other elites are re-visiting their curriculum and general education programs because regardless of if students end up staying at least 4 years, they KNOW that the gen. ed curriculum lacks coherence and isn't very compelling.  So, even if Oxford is doing it to keep students there, at least it is making meaningful changes that will properly educate students in the way they claim they want to.  I started at ECAS, and it was all over the place.  Ensuring students attained most skills and a certain level of thinking was basically left to the departments where students would major and of course not all deliver the same quality of academics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey need to stop juxtaposing themselves against the ECAS experience as much as they do now and make it crystal clear that it will be very different and that it should be for a niche crowd of students like a lot of 4 year LACs) to those who actually want a more intellectually intensive curriculum.   Also, Emory has the same problem with those wearing other gear.  Students at neither have a traditional \"pride\" and are kind of elitist (as one would expect from a bunch of decently well-off kids from regions of the U.S. that put a premium on attending very specific schools).  This happens at lots of non-Ivy/Ivy Plus elites and those without an intense \"big money sports\" scene are especially susceptible.",

I'm involved on campus and have a lot of things going for me academically, which is neat. I'm glad that I chose to attend an institution that has challenging academics yet isn't overly difficult. A lot of people will disagree with me on this, but I don't think the classes at Oxford are *that* hard. Some of the courses that I've taken here are easier than the APs I've previously taken, and I went to an average public school. But regardless of what I've accomplished at Oxford, I'm deeply unhappy here for many of the reasons that user student1576 pointed out (lack of resources, rural location, overall pessimism of campus, and other things). To be honest, I wish I wasn't so caught up with Emory's prestige and ended up committing to school where I could have a more traditional college experience. If you haven't already committed to Oxford, I would go somewhere else, do really well there, and potentially apply to Emory's main campus as a transfer student.",

          "text": "The first two sentences and the last two contradict is all I'll say.  The amount of \"hand-holding\" at Emory somewhat depends on size of a class, but there is a lot to be had if you take lecture track faculty.  I would never say that Oxford has \"too much\" hand-holding.  It is an LAC environment.  It is what it is.  If most ECAS 1st year and 2nd year students had the graded work-load Oxford students had, they would really want and need the same thing.  However, courses are larger, so those that give problem sets and assign supplementary work that is OPTIONAL (ungraded) only  \"do for self\" options like chem, bio, and phys. mentors which Ox also has.  However, if you had to engage primary literature seriously in a lecture and lab component in your general biology course, then I assure you that students at ECAS would demand more faculty interaction/assistance to do these assignments.  \n\nThis was the case when I went and is the case today (even those who took honors versions of courses when they existed).  I mean, it has been shown that students even at the most selective schools have trouble with properly using the vast resources of the huge libraries that exist at these universities because it was rarely a part of HS education.  Whatever you call \"hand-holding\" is likely needed for more beginning classes at Ox than at Emory.  Most survey level teachers at Emory who teach near or more than 100 students per section are not giving assignments that require the same level of engagement or skill-sets.  Even a lot of the freshman seminars are watered down.\n\nAs for networking..gotta be honest.  Let us not pretend most ECAS students are \"networking\" in their first 2 years.  Most are clueless and I don't call rushing a Greek org. \"networking\".  Is it easier for those who want to, sure.  But I'm not gonna sit here and pretend we mostly knew what we were doing.  There is a reason the Career Center and things like PHA are revamping themselves, as well as reasons why they are piloting \"Emory Edge\", and completely revamped the undergraduate research programs to include research ambassadors, research partners, both mentoring programs for those in UG research, as well as a matching program.  This is all because it is easy to get lost at a decent sized university and many students don't know what is available and how to access it.  All of the changes proliferating at ECAS would be considered \"hand-holding\", but it is obviously needed if they want the desired levels of participation and success in these arenas.  Not to mention, ECAS has always had unusually robust academic support programs.  None of this stuff would be the case if they thought ECAS and pre-BBA students just \"got everything\" and knew what to do early on.  \n\nThere would also be no Emory Undergraduate Experience Initiative spurring all the enhancements I mentioned if they thought Emory was doing a good enough job already.  If more \"hand-holding\" will make Emory students more successful and engaged with its oppurtunities, I am down for it and will also not criticize Oxford for already having some of that style of guidance.  And if more of Emory's survey courses could integrate serious research and primary literature exposure at the expense of some more faculty guidance, that would enhance the experience of students in terms of mentoring and intellectual growth.",

                  "text": "I don't know what you are talking about.  I am not talking about busywork.  I am talking about a greater abundance specific TYPES of assignments (such as analyzing and seriously discussing primary literature in a 100 level course) that demand higher levels of cognition being existent in lower division courses.   I am also not talking about grades.  You should know by now that I am never stupid enough to conflate grades with rigor.  If I did that, I would have to just write off Harvard, Yale, etc as \"not rigorous\" because they have had a very high grade inflation over time and to be blunt, those schools at the intro. level, despite their sizes, have classes that try to mimic the types of demands at places like Ox and the 4 year LACs.  For one, most of them have \"sections\" run by TFs where the \"sections\" are usually employed to do extra work that is more cognitively complex than what can be done in the lecture (whether it be challenging problem sets or reading the literature) period.  \n\nThe reason they can do this is because graduate programs at these schools are so consistently strong that they have enough qualified TFs to handle guiding students through the extra work.  Oxford, even though it doesn't have a TF system, just integrates it into the lecture component of the course (in the case of non-STEM courses, but in the case of STEM, lab and lecture) and let some mix of the faculty (who are more available) and undergrad. TAs in the case of STEM do the guiding.  ECAS, to create something that remotely resembles this uses mostly undergraduates in most departs.   And depts like Political science actually recently dropped the discussion sections from most of the intro. courses where they used to exist, so back to lame exams, and maybe a short paper for them!\n\nI only evaluate based upon the cognitive complexity of the demands.   There are also several ECAS classes that have \"busy work\" that go towards the grade.   Bio 141/142 now has mastering biology assignments.   Chemistry has either had ALEXS (w/e) or Aries (back in the day) for its introductory courses.   Why not just tell them, \"ALEX won't be graded but pace yourself with the syllabus\", have the optional problem sets with the bio and chem mentors and then replace the \"busy work\" grades with something more thought provoking?  \n\nThe beginning level course work at Oxford is likely more cognitively demanding (and you can tell by the syllabi which are detailed in terms of the course goals of the assignments) because they get the luxury of giving out such assignments when there is no more than 65 or 70 to a class.  I experienced the same thing at ECAS.  Instructors who capped their survey courses to a lower number were likely attempting a more engaged pedagogy and gave assignments that were intellectually richer.  Soria, for example, gave us problem sets accompanied by a paper or two. And we had to read the paper to extrapolate what to do on the problem set.  This can't even be achieved by Weinschenk because he teaches 100 in each of two sections.  These assignments were usually integrated into the course grade or extra credit to be added to what were often low or mediocre exam scores.  Why would it matter if I am exposed to higher level demands and material?  \n\nI'm sorry, but sitting in lecture courses whose grades are mainly based on some exams (often dominated by multiple choice and other low level items) and a very short writing assignment is not what I call \"rigor\" no matter what grade distribution it churns out versus some other class.  Either way, I know the difference.  ECAS does have some sizable survey level courses that meet the standard of rigor I mention, but they won't be as common.  It is inefficient to do what Oxford instructors do when your class size is 100+.  I used to grade things so would know.  I and the course director would likely cry while grading if the assignments and exams were more complex.  It is extremely hard to do.  Also, notice how, in STEM, the introductory labs (including biology now) DO NOT have lab reports.  This is for a reason.  Never would I call lab reports \"busy work\" as learning to write is important (some STEM majors who won't do research starting at ECAS can potentially graduate without ever having to do scientific writing in their major).  My main point is that Oxford students are more likely to be exposed to real rigor earlier on, whereas ECAS students will see more of it as they approach the upper class years (and yeah, one would hope that if you are in a 300 level seminar style course that it would be more intellectually challenging than a 100-200 level course that attempts to pull off the same style.  By 300 level, it should be assumed students know more) simply because the section sizes are too big to do but so much in and because larger size and more departments confers more choice in course selection.   It isn't because one \"school\" is better or overall more rigorous than the other.  The different sizes just have consequences in terms of how  the education is delivered and when each cohort will experience meaningful rigor.  Discussing any relationship to grades at elite private schools is a useless endeavor.  Emory, one of the lower grading elite publics/privates has an average graduating GPA of 3.4!   That is really high.  One would think none of us were really being made to learn anything in the classroom, but that is a discussion for another day.  ",
