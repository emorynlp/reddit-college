  "title:": "Suggested meal plans for off-campus upperclassman",
  "text": "I will be living off campus this year and am unsure which meal plan I should get (if any). I am able to cook but don't particularly enjoy it, and I'm worried that I won't have enough time to do so frequently during a busy semester (not to mention the time it takes to get from campus back to my apartment). It might be more swipes than I'll end up using, but I'm thinking of getting meal plan D as it seems to be the most cost effective (less money per swipe when subtracting dooley dollar costs from other meal plans) and I can add dooley dollars whenever I want anyways. \n\nDoes this seem like a good idea? What do upperclassman generally do?",
