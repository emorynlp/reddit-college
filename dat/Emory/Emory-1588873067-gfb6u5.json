  "text": "Prospective transfer but the big cost is posing an issue to my fam.\n\nOn the website it says it is about 55200 or about 27600 per semester for tuition expenses alone.\n\nSince this is an estimate, was wondering if you guys usually pay this much or how much it actually costs for yall.\n\nOh, and please also tell the amount of credits you're taking since that also helps too!\n\nThanks",

      "text": "Hi there,\n\nThe sticker cost is about what you say. However, financial aid at Emory is great and they will be more qualified to answer your questions.\n\nAs for credits, you\u2019re either full time and pay it all or part time and pay by the credit. \n\nHope this helps!",

      "text": "As u/TCG_Mike said it's around that range. I should add that full-time is the same cost whether you're 12 credits or 19-22 credits (this was helpful to me for specific reasons, so it's notable).\n\nAnd I know you only asked about tuition, but housing, parking permits, health insurance, and others fees like (recreational/athletic, mental health/counseling, activity, etc.) also add up here and there.\n\nHere's some ways to pay it off. Apply for financial aid, obviously. You might get a university grant this way. Look for scholarships. If you're a resident of GA, the GTEG can take off a few hundred dollars per semester. Federal work-study and subsidized loans are available depending on your family's income. An option further down are unsubsidized loans but they begin accruing interest as soon as you take them out, unlike subsidized loans where school is finished first but are harder to get (watered down explanation). I'd say private loans are a very last resort.\n\nAnd as mentioned already, the financial aid office has always been responsive and helpful whenever I made changes to my enrollment or had any questions.",
