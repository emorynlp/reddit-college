          "text": "I hate to burst your bubble with the grade deflation (they actually don't have it despite what they told you.  Their grading is in line with a lot of privates and selective publics for those courses) thing but Emory grades EXACTLY like those two in core pre-med courses (except that Georgia Tech has a few unusually low grading sections of physics and calculus).  What I will say is that Emory's pre-med courses are a lot \"warmer\" (partly because section sizes are smaller than basically all of those schools, even at ECAS where section sizes are maybe 1/2-2/3 the size of a VU or GaTech, but especially at Oxford where it may be 1/3 or less per section. This means that it is easier for professors to do more than just lecture via powerpoint and give tests for the grade.They can do group activities in and out of class, give graded HW assignments which all help to spread the grade out from high pressure exams. Basically you get many opps to show competence) and taught in ways to keep students relatively excited about those areas.  So I think you made a good decision (I can't say it's \"right\", that'll depend on how YOU experience it starting next year) based on what I know about the STEM curric. at some of these other places, Emory's (along with its professors in them) are a bit more \"interesting\" for sure.\n\nWhile the grading is certainly not ultra generous as you are expecting, they clearly do care more about learning than just weeding people out so you'll see a lot of people perservere even after not earning the best grades in some core courses simply because they found things like bio and chem interesting.  Expect to work and think very hard (as in, learn in a good way, not get a lower grade due to pettiness or a bad classroom environment) at an Ox.  You dodged no bullets on that front but this will benefit you, trust me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way, congratulations and get excited!  Once you get there you won't be worrying about things like grade deflation.  You'll probably be making friends, having a good time, and honestly thinking about how folks at larger schools probably aren't getting the \"style\" of life sciences/pre-med education you will.",

          "text": "\"although I highly doubt going to Emory for undergrad gives applicants a significant advantage\" yeah this is absolutely true unfortunately. Emory med gets about 14k apps a cycle so just going to their undergrad doesn't help, although it allows you to have EC experiences at Emory hospitals like scribing And volunteering or working with Emory research. If you can work at the cdc that would look good as well",
