      "text": "I wouldn't be surprised if none of those people taught last year or ever at Emory (look at fall 2020 and see if any did and if only some did, narrow it to those).  Usually 111 is mostly grad students and a couple of faculty (as it is at most) and it's possible none of them are good.  My understanding is that math 111 gives standardized assessments and they usually make people sweat, even those who took HS/AP and/or ended up making some sort of A which is a far cry from what it used to be in the dino ages when I attended.  \n\nThe grad. Students, especially the worse in teaching quality, would usually water down their assessments to compensate so many sections would have mediansin the 90s because the tests would pretty much repeat book problems with different numbers.  Now there seems to be one or several course directors (likely including Garcia) who obviously wanted to make 111 mimic other intro STEMs in rigor, but this also means it has learning asisistants p-sets/sessions and other resources that it lacked before to support you through it.  \n\nBut seems like the days of easy breezy calc. 1 are long gone (I'm betting there was pressure from QTM where many are social science concentrators who may not have had calc. in HS and if they get some weak sauce stuff for 111, they are screwed for math 210 and any upper division QTM course).",

              "text": "Yeah, I don't think they've revamped Calc. 2.  Was that during the semester? It looks like they got to calc. 1 and poured resources(mainly the LA problem sheets and sessions) into it so that they can give harder common exams across sections.  112 may be untouched for several reasons:\n\nA) Most pre-meds (who are mostly NBB and bio majors with a minority in chem and anthro I think) will take math 116 which is intense enough simply due to the content, but could also be made more challenging depending upon the instructor and how they decide to test and quiz students (Garcia, for example, tends to veer away from cookbook math and will ask more conceptual Qs as well as use the computational problem types that require more algebraic manipulation and \"tricks\" from what I've seen)\n\nB) QTM majors are required to take math 210 which is also intense due to content (and an application lab) and because they apparently put a somewhat rigorous professor (actual faculty member) there.\n\nC) Many math and physics majors will have BC credit so will start in the 200 levels (221, 212, 211, or even honors 275/6 if they ever bring that course back. Kind of sad to see it disappear).\n\nThat leaves 112 as the foundation course that serves the least amount of students (maybe econ majors and a few chem majors, and those with AB credit only who aren't pre-med. Physics majors?) so I don't expect the math dept to do much about that. Most of the pressure to be more rigorous is probably on math 111 and 210 which feed into 116/210 and upper division QTMs respectively.",

      "text": "Never heard of any of these instructors, they're probably all grad students. There are endless resources for calc 1 online and at Emory. People that struggle with calculus tend to do so because they have a loose foundation in algebra and trig. So, if you are iffy on those, now would be the time to review. Khan academy is a good place to start.",
