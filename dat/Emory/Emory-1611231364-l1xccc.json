  "text": "Hey all, just a few quick questions that u guys may be able to answer. For context, I am a freshman entering my first spring semester here at Emory. I am thinking about doing the dual degree program with Georgia tech in order to do economics at Emory and mechanical engineering at Georgia tech. My question is do u think the program is worth it and if so, why? Another question I have is whether or not economics is a good major to do at Emory and what are the job prospects like. (I would really appreciate it if a senior currently completing the program could offer me some insight).",

      "text": "Ask yourself why or what would you want to do with the engineering degree? Do you plan to use it for grad. school or a job? If you do it, are you willing to maximize the degree's worth by doing Tech's co-op program?  To me, an engineering degree should not just be done for \"fun\" or as back-up especially in a long drawn out dual degree program. I'd say only do it if you are viewing economics  as a supplement to the engineering degree (maybe you could make connections at Tech's business school when at Tech).  But I wouldn't go this route if it costs you lots of extra time and money and you just wanna say \"I did something challenging that could maximize chances of me getting a good job\".  There are ways to do that at ECAS if you're serious.  I'm sure people who are doing/completing it will say good things but you need to know why YOU are doing it.  They may have been doing it for totally valid reasons that make it worth it for them but wouldn't make much sense for you",

      "text": "very few people do the dual degree program (on the dl, it's widely acknowledge to be a 3+3 to 3+4 program since many credits will not transfer). If you want to do an engineering degree, honestly your best bet is to tranfer to a different university ASAP. Otherwise, content yourself with double majoring in the physics or math departments",
