  "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI had a few questions about class enrollment on August 9th for freshmen.\n\n1.\tDo we sign up for the classes that we put in our cart via OPUS? Is there like an exact method someone can detail?\n2.\tWhat are the enrollment appointments? Is that where we sign up for classes or is it through OPUS?\n3.\tThis is more of a personal question, but does my schedule look okay for a PPL (Philosophy, Politics, Law) Major on the pre-law track? \n4.\tIs Film 101 a popular class that many people want to take? Do the spots fill up fast?\n\nClasses: https://imgur.com/a/joKhjSo\nClass Names: https://imgur.com/a/NJNjmMV",

      "text": "Thursday looks pretty packed. Might be better to drop PE or take HLTH/ECS on Friday. Also, not entirely sure about this since I\u2019ve never taken PE so don\u2019t know how they\u2019re like but might not be the best idea to go straight to another class after having taken a PE class.\n\nOther ppl would also probably tell you to take a seminar in a subject that\u2019s new and outside of something you\u2019re really interested in. Personally think it\u2019s fine to take something in whatever though. \n\nThere should be a guide somewhere on how the sing-up process works. Don\u2019t remember if it was online or in my email. Pretty much though an enroll button will appear in your shopping cart once registration opens. You reload 1-3 seconds before it starts, then it\u2019ll show up. Click the boxes of the classes you want and press enroll. You\u2019re done. You should also know how swapping works too in case you can\u2019t get a class.",

      "text": "For number 3: Phil 110 is definitely a good class to start off with but I will warn you that it is very different from most other philosophy classes and some people just get logic or they don\u2019t. If you don\u2019t that\u2019s ok but just make sure to go to office hours to get it down. Ppl is a pretty small major so you can take it easy your freshman year on the major courses, I didn\u2019t start taking Phil classes until my second semester.",
