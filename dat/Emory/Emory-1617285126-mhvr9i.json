      "text": "Generally you can find cheaper off-campus housing than on-campus. \n\nUpperclassmen on-campus housing is on the Clairmont campus. Towers is the cheapest housing option, if you share a bedroom - it's generally considered the worse of the buildings and has a reputation for frequent fire alarms. Laundry is shared. The most common towers floor plans are 1-bedrooms (you can supersingle or need 1 roommate) and 2 bedrooms (you need 1-3 roommates depending on super singles), but there are some 3 bedrooms (you need 2-5 roommates, depending on supersingles).  URC and CRC are both considered nice. You get a private room in both of them and in-unit laundry, and in CRC get a private bathroom. For URC, you need to find 3 roommates to fill an apartment. CRC you need 1 roommate to fill the 2 bedroom (the most common apt layout), but there are also some singles and a few triples. If you can afford it, I'd recommend CRC or URC, depending on how important a private bathroom is to you and how many potential roommates you have",

      "text": "I loved living off campus in Clairmont Reserve my junior and senior years!  Cheaper and nicer than on campus, and a 7 minute walk to the Clairmont shuttle. Also, it meant we didn't have to move out in between school years which was amazing. We bought a lot of our furniture second hand/got old things from relatives, so it wasn't too hard to furnish the place.",

      "text": "Off campus is definitely gonna be cheaper. Clairmont has its ups and downs, but being far away from main campus can really be a drag sometimes. I lived in Highland Square which was within 15-20min walking distance on main campus, where as Clairmont is much further unless you like biking :)",
