      "text": "Slow inflation/get what you earn (most inflation occurs in humanities where some professors don't wanna fight with students who expect high grades due to a reputation for easy grading in such depts.  The social sciences can have some but are generally more rigorous and serious grading than many students expect so be careful).  Grading in STEM follows more selective public universities and the slower inflating privates (like VU, Penn, Cornell, and JHU, and maybe Northwestern).  Some at these comparable schools would characterize what they have as \"deflation\" but that is inaccurate. It's simply \"less inflated\" than some other top tiers and a lot of the top tiers with higher inflation have much more complex pre-med STEM courses on average than places with lower inflation so I think it balances out.  If Harvard wants to curve their \"intro bio\" (which equates to an advanced/intermediate cell bio/biochem hybrid at lower tier elites. The course not only emphasizes an unusual amount of experimental biology but teaches students a solid amount of organic chemistry. It would be like if chem 202 at Emory had a purely biology focus and also blended in content and problems from Emory's OLD biol 142 which was much more complex than it is now) to a B+ while Emory and those other schools target a B-/B in their less complex analogs, that makes total sense to me. \n\n The trickiness only occurs when you have a professor (and these professors are deservedly popular at Emory) IS at the level of the analogs at the schools with the most rigorous STEM curricula and then are told by the department to target the same average as other sections. In such cases, it is fair within the Emory context, but slightly unfair when compared to other schools (like when you have a professor like Weinschenk or Soria at Emory, they'll stick to department norms of B- or B in years with strong performers whereas the WUSTL course or the Harvard course at the same calibre will curve to B+).",

              "text": "Yeah don't worry about \"deflation\" stuff.  It generally doesn't exist in STEM anywhere (the student bodies that complain about it are usually quick to compare themselves and their courses to places where courses are generally more intellectually rigorous and have a bad gauge on how challenging their own courses are.  The fact is, they didn't expect to be challenged in STEM at a top tier college for whatever reason which is weird. Emory is on the lower grading side of privates but I think students are less delusional and maybe less entitled about expectations than some other students on average so you don't see them screaming \"grade deflation!\" en masse when asked about STEM.  People just suck it up and do the work for the most part. It certainly isn't the worst top tier in terms of intellectuality and attitudes towards learning especially considering it's a pre-professional factory) Courses can just be objectively challenging which you kind of want. \n\n Just do the work and thinking and you'll be fine. In high average (80%+)courses, your grade will be assigned on a traditional scale. In lower raw score average courses, the professor will curve scores upwards to the target average.  You shouldn't be afraid of either scenario. In fact, the latter may be better because even though your grades on tests won't look like HS where its always 90+(and you get some sort of A for that), you have more room for error and can at least get exposed to harder problems and concepts without a penalty. STEM professors who give you a top tier uni experience won't screw you over grade wise (in a medium/standard difficulty course, a B will require an 83 and 90 starts the A range. In a challenging course, maybe between 65 and 75 is a B and 75ish and 85ish+ is some sort of an A depending on how tests are written. The latter system is basically more like the British system); they know they are challenging you. Likewise, professors who aren't know they aren't so you better be perfect in their courses",
