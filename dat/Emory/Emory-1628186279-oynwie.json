  "text": "I\u2019m part of STEM pathways so ECS 101 is pre-registered for me so I can enroll up to 7 more credits on the first day of registration.  I for sure want to enroll in QTM 100 because there are more limited amount of seats. For the remaining 3 credits (QTM 100 is 4) should I enroll in a freshman seminar course or chem 150 lecture since I know both courses will fill up quickly too?",
