  "text": "Hey guys!\n\nI\u2019m a transfer student, and I was wondering what a normal room at the Clairmont Towers were like. The pictures on the website are a little confusing because there are some pictures of a really modern hotel-looking room, and a less extravagant room that looks a little old. Any pictures will from the Towers or other parts of Clairmont housing will be greatly appreciated!!",
