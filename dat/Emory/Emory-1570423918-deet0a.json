      "text": "Ok, jesus christ. I don't want the second sub to go down . . . These are actually unrelated to Emory, but you seem to care about getting good and clean (in terms of malware) software for free.\n\n1. IRC thread, sub is like pirate we all know what that one is. Good websites for research papers, textbooks, ebooks.  I never buy books anymore. I can find the really good to somewhat lesser known ones, and those are all I need. Then IRC, the more advanced way of finding books. You also don't need to pay for MIRC if you do it right.\n2. Now this one is pretty damn critical. It's a godsend in its rarity, and getting it shut down would be blasphemy. If you look up \"microsoft office 2013-2019 reddit free\" it'll show up. Super easy to get the full, up-to-date microsoft suite. You can also get the win os . . . there may or may not be very simple ways on there to get Adobe products too . . . Verified of course.",
