You could try the Asian Student Organization, but even that heavily represents East Asia. If you want the same kind of family vibe/clique that FSA at other schools tend to have, you can try the Vietnamese Student Association.",

I just feel like Tech and Emory are more so sibling schools (in terms of collaboration, selectivity, wealth of student body, and even many demographic characteristics on the surface at least) so it makes more sense to compare them.  Main difference is that Tech is public so may reflect metro Atlanta and GA far better (majority IS.  Emory may only be like 15-25% GA depending on year).",

And maybe it\u2019s just a bias due to my ties, but one reason I transferred here was because I had Filipino connections in the Atlanta area too so I was also surprised that Emory had so few.",
