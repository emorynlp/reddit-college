Would taking differential equations before linear algebra be impossible to do?\n\nThanks in advance!",

              "text": "Yelton is one of the better multivariable professors, from what I've heard. I had him (albeit online) and he's a pretty nice guy. He's not a stellar teacher (there aren't many stellar teachers in the math dept from what I can tell), but he's fairly accessible and approachable; RMP is a bit harsher than it should be to him, imo. Things will probably be different in person, but the people who I've talked to seem to think he's better than Shull. Make of that what you will.\n\nOf course, you'd have to weigh that against the diffeq professors next semester; I unfortunately don't know anything about any of them.\n\nAs for linear algebra, I took diffeq before it and it wasn't terrible. In retrospect, it probably would have been nice to have taken linear algebra first, but it's definitely not a must if there's some reason you really need to take 212 first.",
