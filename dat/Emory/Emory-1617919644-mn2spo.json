      "text": "Tbh it\u2019s almost a no-brainer. You\u2019re going into a prestige oriented field where one school is a T20ish college and the other is a T70. Over that Emory has a renowned business school. Emory is much higher in the pecking order and in that field brand matters a lot. Not to mention the price is the same. The prestige, networking, quality of life, and opportunities would be much greater for no extra price. Even you prefer out of state. So I think the decision from a rational standpoint is pretty clear. If you want to work in high finance like banking/consulting then Emory is the move",

          "text": "I think the question is if the person wants to work harder to stand out/be competitive and maybe not have the social life of a stereotypical state school vs. maybe having to work less hard, standing out, and being near home and perhaps able to have a more \"American Pie\" or \"college movie\" experience. I basically agree with you but the allure for the latter is strong now-a-days and I kind of get it (It didn't have allure to me but American media has crafted this imagery around the college experience that neither Emory campus fits but so well).",

I'm sure it's still possible though. The path through Emory would be far more clear. \n\nIf you're planning to do like a f500 rotational program and work your way up the ladder, I'd take the state school",
