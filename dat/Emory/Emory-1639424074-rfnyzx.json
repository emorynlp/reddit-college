                  "text": "Maybe you're being cheeky but I don't think that is how it works(many places above us are remote and are in places with FAR worse public transport than ATL metro) but I'm not mad at Emory's current position (theoretically some of these schools above us have done so by the wildest marketing schemes and upon anything but a superficial analysis, we'd realize they should be ranked only as high or lower in the 20s somewhere) so what do I care? It costs when you actually try to admit a range of students.\n\n There is no magic bullet(specifically magic bullets that don't involve changes in disposition or makeup of the student body towards academics or career aspirations) for Emory becoming more \"prestigious\" except for better programs and better financial aid accompanied by much better marketing.  When you're Emory, you actually have to become better to advance in the rankings while some schools just stats whore and sell fun/nice amenities while improving very little in areas that make their students have better outcomes.  It is what it is.  And also, keeping it 100, current Emory students have to demand the things that would make it actually better and I'm not just talking nice dining, housing, and amenities (like a light rail line). There is a ceiling to how high that'll take a place. Ask WUSTL(which based on research calibre and academics may be slightly under-ranked IMO) and Vandy.  Maxed out stats, ever lower admit rates and very nice campuses, but hover around 14-15 while schools with similar or lower stats and less stellar facilities stay above.  \n\nThe T10-12 schools typically have different cultural and academic characteristics that make them stand out that Emory students seem uninterested in or straight up wouldn't want Emory having. I personally would even like the Georgetown model where its prestige and performance in terms of post-grad success far outperforms the ranking(they actually look more like T10s in many areas regarding this) because they have extremely good undergrad programs (between in the classroom and out of classroom experiences) in areas they excel in as well as strong career and networking infrastructure. Then there is also Berkeley which is on a different level versus many places below the T10 or so but gets punished for being big basically(when smaller places aren't even taking advantage of that small size as much as they should).",
