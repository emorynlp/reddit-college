  "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nWe (the Emory Robotics Club) are hosting a Hackathon next month. It'll be a 36 hour competition the weekend of April 11. We've got prizes, food and the chance to come together with kids from all over the country to make something really cool.\n\nAlso, there's no experience required, we're setting up a sort of \"Novice Cup\" for anyone who just wants to come out and learn (we'll help you out along the way, don't worry).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. Sign up now because spots are limited and handed out on a first-come first-serve basis!\n\nRegistration (free):\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/emory-hackathon-2014-tickets-10142680029?ref=elink\n\nWebsite:\nhttp://emoryhackathon.org/\n\nFacebook event:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/677213218989086/",
