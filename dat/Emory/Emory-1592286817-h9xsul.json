I\u2019m also skeptical whether they can actually keep up with administering covid-19 tests during the semester for symptomatic people and their close contacts.\n\nAnd more importantly, whether they\u2019ll give us the option of P/F (so I can slack off for one more semester \ud83e\udd74) if they kick us out again",
