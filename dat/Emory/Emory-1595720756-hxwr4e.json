  "text": "Hey there, I'd like to preface this by saying I'm not a student at Emory (Yet! Hopefully soon), but I'll be applying in the fall of 2021 as an ED applicant. Unfortunately due to a certain virus who shall remain unnamed, I haven't been able to visit campuses at all. Emory is my dream school, and I want to know more about what it looks like for real, not just YouVisit. Since campus is opening, could I possibly just take a stroll through campus with my family given we adhere to the proper guidelines (masks, etc)? Or do I need to specifically schedule a tour with Emory?",
