      "text": "I guess I\u2019d say Fevans = Clifton > Woodruff > Harris (Fevans vs Clifton comes down to whether you value a great location or the privacy of an apartment more)\n\nClifton Tower: apartment style (either 4 or 6 people) which is super nice. Recently renovated too. It\u2019s pretty far from everything though (it\u2019s next to SHS, across Clifton Road)\n\nFew/Evans: really nice rooms, they\u2019re new as well. Location is great, standard double rooms\n\nHarris: if all your classes are in the bschool, this is the best location. If not, it\u2019s pretty bad. Has lots of singles but is generally not as nice as Few/Evans, and it\u2019s pretty old\n\nWoodruff: suite style rooms and the cafe are definite upsides, the location (next to Clifton Tower) is a drawback",
