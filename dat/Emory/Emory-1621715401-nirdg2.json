  "text": "Hi I\u2019m an incoming freshman and I\u2019ve injured my knee really bad. I can barely walk and will be like that for a while. Anyway so are there any accommodations for people in my situation. I had a similar injury freshman year of high school and it took about 7 months to recover. However it\u2019s much easier to handle in high school because the buildings are really small and they assigned someone to help and it wasn\u2019t that difficult. However the walks seem really long in college and I can barely get up for more than a couple of minutes. So it would be great if you guys knew if there were any good accommodations that I should look for. Also do the Rez halls have elevators?",
