Not just a professor he is an excellent human being and he is one of the best people i have ever met in my life. I went to one prof banerjee's class and freaked out and left. Also ik a person who literally changed their major because of Prof Banerjee's class. That does not mean prof banerjee is bad hes an excellent professor but hes relatively more difficult. \n\nI repeat SALTZMAN IS THE BEST AND COOLEST PROFESSOR EVER. TAKE HIM WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED. YOU WONT REGRET.",
