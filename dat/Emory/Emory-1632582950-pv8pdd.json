      "text": "Not to question your research methodology, but I see you are posting this survey across various subreddits. Aren't you basically asking redditors their opinion, which will not accurately represent the Atlanta student population?\n\nThe people  on reddit  will skew white/techy/liberal/upper-middle class. You're also only to get responses from people who see this and take the time to do the survey, which are likely people with stronger feelings on the issue.",
