      "text": "Inflation or deflation compared to what (I feel like so many who talk about this, even college students in the thick of things, have no understanding or barometer for what this is and how to measure it.  People who complain of deflation are making stuff up based on: \"Well I was perfect in high school and I studied and worked harder than I did in HS sometimes and only got a B or B- in the course here so this school must be grade deflated\".  No maybe their study strategies have not been adapted for the new demands of the university or college and those demands are much more complex than back in HS. That is just \"harder than most HS classes\" not \"grade deflation\")? \n\nInflation is merely a trend where grades tend to increase over time.  Almost ALL schools have that and elites definitely have that.  Emory has it but it is in the lower tier of elites in terms of the amount of inflation that has occurred. For privates, put it in the Cornell, Penn, Vanderbilt, and JHU group.  People call these other places \"deflated\" but they really just have slower or later inflation than other schools. Generally people at Emory don't complain about grading so most would likely characterize it as \"fair\".  I really don't know many schools with \"unfair\" grading despite how some student bodies complain more than others.  What you should be worried about is how difficult courses or certain majors in terms of courseload/number of requirements and complexity of material and assessments. That and your willingness to adapt and work hard will ultimately determine how you do, not grading patterns vs. other schools.\n\n  For example, many of the places known for high inflation like HYS and them have REALLY challenging gateway STEM courses in terms of cognitive complexity so them being curved slightly more generously than analogous courses elsewhere actually makes a lot of sense. And even with that curve, the mean and medians for STEM will be in the B range (instead of the B or B- of schools that generally do less complexity, they may curve to B+). The real inflation EVERYWHERE primarily comes from humanities and some social sciences which have very different grading norms and assignments more susceptible to subjectivity (which allows for more grade negotiations by students so professors don't bother giving many \"low\" grades) \n\nThis is what you should worry about at Emory: Non traditional chem curriculum. 1st 4 courses deviate from what you see at most other peer universities and would be considered \"harder\" in terms of the content and framing of content (organic 1, chem 203, for example uses MO theory as the framework for the whole course as opposed to something quickly touched to never be seen again beyond the first unit or so). No doubt IB people have an advantage over AP in the first two chem classes as they emphasize conceptual/structural chem and organic chem more than standard gchem sequences which are a plug and chug math fest that most STEM majors are used to from HS chem and AP. The \"organic\" sequence has a first course more reminiscent of what an HYPSM would cover.  The 2nd \"organic\" course is something else altogether (material science, biopolymers, etc.  Organic is the foundation you use to understand it all, but it goes beyond just standard organic reactivity)\n\n\nBio and physics are fairly \"normal\" (no Emory special sauce except the teaching style and active learning in bio I guess) with bio 141 in particular being almost an \"AP +\" sort of thing.  bio 142 may deviate away from AP some but is super manageable.\n\nThe NBB major is the challenge because unlike most neuro majors at other schools it is more regimented with 4 core courses with maybe 3 of them being quite a challenge for most (NBB 301 is like an interdisciplinary chem, physics, bio course. Quite problem solving oriented. 401 is writing heavy and emphasizes reading primary scientific literature which is very different from textbook learning and many schools don't require courses like it for neuro majors). The GPA balance will likely come from how you choose electives but if you choose to take it easy with electives, you should probably choose more rigorous chem, bio, and NBB core professors to ensure you get the MCAT skills and prep from those.  \n\nYou also.have courses that are less complex content wise but ultra tedious like QTM 100.  And other courses that have apparently become quite rigorous in terms of the level of problem solving or understanding they expect vs. the past like math 111 and math 116(a weird life sciences calc class that covers some multi, linear, diff eq, and stats/probability. I think only JHU has an analogous course), all a part of the NBB and most pre-med heavy majors.\n\n* Either way, grading hasn't changed much. Of course virtual learning results in some temporary extra inflation but when it ends, courses will go back to normal.\n\nAcademically, Emory's pre-med type courses and curricula will be most similar to the interesting things that you see at say WUSTL and JHU than other similar caliber peers (I am removing most other top 10 schools from the discussion because, again, many are on some other stuff that separates them from other elites completely). I guess the D3 schools just do things differently.\n\nMaybe with other schools/in the future, ask \"how are the STEM courses that pre-meds take and how do you think they differ from HS, AP, IB, or curricula at other schools?  Do you think these changes make the courses more challenging and interesting than average? Do teachers create artificial rigor by putting 'tricky' questions and unreasonable time constraints versus adding complexity or real applications? Do things like biology and neuro courses only emphasize memorization and regurgitation of content or are they kind of or mostly problem solving and research focused\" \"Could any differences help for the MCAT?'. \n\nAsking about grading patterns without the context of the types and caliber of courses (and like I explained in exhaustive detail above: No, students at elite schools are NOT learning the same stuff.  That throw-a-way line people say just isn't true. There is a lot of variation within this group and at colleges in general, but especially within the elite tier of schools) you'll take is not gonna get you useful information about how you'll experience the curriculum.  Like Harvard's first year life sciences/biology course is more similar to an advanced or intermediate biochemistry or cell biology course at other elite universities and colleges.  If you aren't willing to work and think very hard, it being curved to a B+ vs. a B/B- of the easier courses elsewhere won't save you.  You may just end up at the bottom half of the Harvard course and get a B in it and get a B+/A- at the \"deflated\" school where the faculty pitched a less complex or intensive course.",

              "text": "Yw, make sure you ask the questions you actually want answered.  I have always seen how these little inflation/deflation threads go,  You have idiots in STEM at some Emory tier elites who actually try to convince themselves that their school is hardballing them or something vs. say...a Harvard because the average in the course is a level lower so they would come at you and say \"we have massive grade deflation here\" when they really just mean \"for some reason I find it challenging here and I don't like that\".  The fact is, every school challenges its cohort in STEM.  Less selective schools just have to use easier assessments and assignments to challenge their less well selected students.  More well-selected schools do the same with their more well selected cohorts.  \n\nWhen people at selective schools claim \"deflation\" they are basically telling you that for some odd reason they expected the academics (even in STEM for which selective colleges and universities are known to be tough) to be similar to much less selective schools (they'll say things like: \"I would have easily gotten an A at my state school\".  Yeah, except they chose not to go there).  You need to ask why they think they are getting lower than what they wanted and the answer isn't magical \"grade deflation\". Simply ask why do they find the coursework challenging and they may describe it for you.\n\nSometimes it may be the teaching quality or relative lack of formal support services but they won't know that because students do tend to assume that teaching and academic support works the same way at other, especially similar caliber schools, when it doesn't.  Some schools have way more robust academic support services as well as encourage teaching methods in STEM that allow students to perform better with harder content and problems than other schools. That's just a fact. Maybe ask: \"Do they do lots of active learning or is it just lecturing and powerpoint slides for most pre-med courses here?\". Lecturing is usually fine for memory courses but active learning and other methods work well for problem solving and critical thinking focused courses). \n\nThese things should matter if you are pursuing anything STEM related. If in life sciences, rote memorization vs. problem solving and critical thinking focused in those courses matter because the MCAT is more like the latter, so you'd wanna ask stuff like: \"Are biology and neuro courses here challenging because they require you memorize every single detail or because they require far more critical thinking than typical HS life sciences courses? What has been y'alls experience with life sciences courses\"?  Many schools have lots of faculty in biology and neuro who have moved towards emphasizing critical thinking, problem solving, and experimental biology in these historically memory based subjects and some places only have a few faculty who you'd have to cherrypick into and most overwhelmingly, even in upperdivision courses, emphasize content intake and regurgitation. \n\n Another way you can ask about this is by asking: \"How many bio/neuro courses have you taken that require students to read several primary scientific research articles vs. just learn via textbook and slides?\" as the MCAT is passage based and designs its passages based on those research articles (has figures from them and everything so if you take courses that get you to learn how to read those, it helps way more than pure textbook learning which tends to strip out how the science is done and real data figures). And if you don't want to ask all these questions on the thread, ask if anyone at that school is willing to be PMed some questions about their STEM course work experience as a pre-med student. You want details that go beyond: \"Awww it's so damned hard to make a solid A\". You want to get into why so you know what skills you may have to hone or develop to win at that particular school (will you have to be able to memorize way more and way faster or will you have to problem solve your way out of a paper bag because teachers put problems only perhaps vaguely related to ones you practiced that separated As from Bs or Bs from Cs)?)",

      "text": "> OSFL has finalized the spring 2019 grade report for Emory\u2019s Greek organizations. The all-Greek grade point average (GPA) for spring 2019 is 3.503, comparing well with the non-Greek average of 3.527.\n\nThe average gpa for undergrads here is about a 3.52. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty good, and it\u2019s more or less in line with the average GPA of other schools like WashU and Hopkins. Not many universities have an average undergrad gpa of 3.6+. Maybe Brown, Duke, Harvard, Stanford, and Yale...can\u2019t really think of any others.\n\nIn general though, I\u2019d say most intro science classes usually have an average of B-/B. I think this gets a bit better once you get to upper level courses, but I\u2019m not really sure. Some humanities classes definitely have grade inflation though, especially non-intro ones. Well, outside of b-school courses, since apparently they actually limit the amount of people who can get an A.\n\nThere\u2019s definitely grade inflation rn because of Covid (even in the intro science classes \u2014 the average grade for chem 150 was a B+/A- last sem), but that\u2019s not going to hold true once everyone\u2019s back on campus. The nice thing about Emory though is that you have plenty of resources to help you succeed (free tutoring, learning assistant sessions over the weekend) and everyone is willing to help, including your professors and classmates. \n\nFor the most part, there seems to be a kind and collaborative atmosphere. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t mind if the classes here can be a bit harder than usual \u2014 everything else makes up for it! And plus, I\u2019ve gotten the impression that most people who take their classes seriously end up doing well, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about your grades here if you can dedicate a good amount of time studying for your classes each week! That\u2019s easier said than done though; not procrastinating and being responsible in college is hard.",

          "text": "Technically Emory should be getting the \"grade deflation\" complaints that places like Cornell, Hopkins, and VU get but I think it is largely mitigated because it seems from what I've heard from friends who went to such places, the professors in STEM at Emory make it \"funner\" and use more diverse (maybe even more effective) teaching methods.\n\n A pure lecture with only exams as your grade feels more stressful than maybe pbl/active group based learning in class sessions with a mix of tests, quizzes, and assignments (group and otherwise) for the final grade in lecture components. Students feel better when less of the grade rides on the \"big tests\" regardless of how.tough those tests and assignments are and how the final averages end up.  Basically it seems many Emory profs (and it does look like a pattern or something that was orchestrated in the life sciences and chemistry such that most profs do it. Thank ole retired Pat Marsteller for a lot of it) make weeders not \"feel\" as much like weeders. Students just try the best they can and that's it. No need for constant accusations of deflation or oppression.  Plus things like epass and the LA system are very well developed (like well over a decade old). Believe it or not, some peers just recently (like 2-3 years ago) developed somewhat similar programs and they aren't as robust.\n\n*Now if only physics and math got the memos",

                  "text": "Well, the 100 and 200 levels are CRITICAL foundations for these upper division courses.  It is believable that the 300 levels have a bigger variety of teaching techniques because they are smaller, but 100 and 200 either needed to get on board with that (many are capped at like 60 students or less in math for example which is smaller than bio and chem's 100 per section yet the latter do a lot more) or become more consistently rigorous (intellectually not just workload).  I know things like physics 15x and the 200 levels are such toss-ups depending on what professor you get. This is especially for math-people who choose to use an AP BC credit, which are a lot, will start in the 200s and it sets the expectations for what they think math at Emory is like.  Imagine breezing through a 200 level course(s) and then hitting a 300 or 400 level instructor that actually pitches the class at the appropriate level you would expect high achievers at a top tier university to engage.  I promise most students aren't going to blame the 200 level faculty that pitched a joke course that was supposedly the foundation of later ones. In fact, they may celebrate them (you even see this when students switch professors across a semester in a sequenced course. If the 2nd one is more demanding, even if the demands make them develop better and are meaningful and not just extra work/petty, they'll still blame that prof and reminisce about the past semester). They will direct their ire at the 300-400 level professor that is technically doing what they are supposed to do rigor wise or choosing a \"weird\" course format that they don't wanna be bothered with.\n\n The problem with physics 15x is that only one section is offered so whoever that is sets the level of learning students entering the physics and other physical science (chemistry which either physical or natural) majors or pre-dual degree folks.  They really need to entertain getting an honors intro. physics (and maybe steering stronger students towards by sending invitation or something.  Flattery can generate some demand for such courses) section like most of our peer institutions and the math dept have (math has lots of entry pathways for students based upon AP credit and experience including the 275/276 sequence...now teaching quality and intellectual rigor over there is loosey goosey too as a I said, but they have the right idea.  As solid as chem and bio are overall, I think they should consider having more entry pathways for STEM majors and pre-meds as well).  Physics 15x tends to have large chunks of students with AP physics and/or both AP math credits and yet, unless with Bing (and maybe even with him) the course does not seem comparable to the calculus based courses targeting future physics and engineering majors elsewhere (including to places dual degree students will transfer to like Georgia Tech) with high selectivity.  In fact, it actually mirrors the classes that at least half of these other schools have PRE-MEDs take (like half of our peers have any STEM major or pre-meds take a calculus based physics class, in many cases a life sciences focused course with biological applications and whatnot. Emory offers no such thing and crowds all the pre-meds into a trig/algebra based class with who knows what professor that does who knows what and then an under-developed inconsistent calc. based course for more serious STEM majors).  \n\nI've heard that courses like math 111 make more sense (in the context of a top tier school now. Doesn't mean that students like it. Lots of Emory students took AP or honors calc. in HS so expect ease or to learn it the same way so naturally resist it.  In the early days of math 116 which has lots of modelling and whatnot, it was written about in a publication how the AP crowd was most resistant because they thought they had an idea of what \"math\" is.  I think both math 111/112 always had a reputation of being a cakewalk at Emory before Garcia came along so this probably plays into student expectations as well) than in the past because it appears they have Garcia influencing or basically redesigning that class to be the level and rigor of the life sciences courses (and with the same academic resources attached to it), but there is just so much inconsistency in physics and math generally.  I get that math serves way more students at the 100-200 level (even 3 in some cases) than there is demand so that places limitations, but most physics departments elsewhere have figured something out where they at least offer 3 tiers of first year/entry level physics courses consistently pitched and taught at a level one would expect top tier students to learn at.\n\nThis may be because many other physics departments micromanage the entry and foundation level courses in a way that ensures no matter who teaches it (or even the teaching method), it is done in a certain way and at a certain level.  Chemistry and biology (despite a couple slacker gen. bio teachers always existing) at Emory clearly have much more quality control so that the floor doesn't completely drop. God knows what you'll get from semester to semester in physics and math at those levels and of course when a student (anywhere really) gets something below par that made it easier for them to score high, they aren't going to complain no matter what they have to take in the future.  When in the moment, very few undergrads think long term (I've been there, I'll admit it).  \n\nYou just think: \"Oh this professor makes it really easy for me to 'succeed' when they make it easy, and they are just so kind\" and it only seems common for students at Ivies (and maybe other Ivy Plus) to gauge their education vs. what friends have at similar schools (Emory students are more likely to compare to their friends at a local state school even if they have friends at other top tiers which is weird because it suggests that, for whatever reason, students are really hoping or thinking the rumors of their \"elite\" university generally being more demanding than a run-of-the mill public school aren't true) so that they know they aren't getting short sold or fed some mess far below what the place claims it gives. Those at other schools just assume what they are getting is normal for that tier of school so they don't know or choose to investigate.  You just know something is odd when students expect things like high raw test and quiz averages in physics and math courses at Emory. That expectation wouldn't be there if it had not been the status quo/Emory had been in line with schools it aspires to compete with (mainly that top 10 group. Emory is generally similar to some private schools below that). Also, telling that many 100-200 level maths at Emory don't have the robust academic resources (like learning assistant sessions) and whatnot.",

Or was it just giving students more time or a different format on basic tasks due to Covid? Basically, do the changes serve a purpose beyond lowering the stress levels of the student and teacher because usually when active learning and other things are tried in other departments, it is to build a course structure that would help facilitate higher level learning and problem solving than in a passive lecture (which is okay primarily for memory/algorithmic problem solving demands and not much more) and not only to dissipate feelings of stress. It is basically like instructors figuring out how to make students jump higher and think deeper about concepts presented in class without students knowing that is what is happening.\n\n In a pure lecture format with maybe a couple of \"optional\" practice assignments (like book problems) between tests, students will easily figure out if they get lectures covering A,B,Cs, cram that practice which is largely A,B,Cs and a couple of sentences, and then hit super highly weighted tests where the teacher expected them to understand a mix of A,B,Cs,sentences and paragraphs. It's probably why many pure lecturers, even at places like Emory just stick to A,B,Cs (repetition/recitation of class stuff and assigned problems with slightly altered variables) in assessments. They don't wanna be bothered by complaining students but also don't want to set up the infrastructure (they either don't want to design their own problems or they don't want to grade extra stuff) to help students go higher.",
