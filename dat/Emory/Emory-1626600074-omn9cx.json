  "text": "Hi! Just a quick question. Is it worth scheduling biol 141 lab 15 minutes after biol 141 if that means almost no classes on Friday? \nIf I\u2019m to take it on Friday, class will end pretty late (around 5:30)\n\nAlso, would you recommend O\u2019Toole or Abreu?",

      "text": "I would say so. You're already in the building. There's not really any prep you have to do before you go to lab except bring your PPE. For me, there was a short 10-minute quiz before every session but that's it.\n\nNo class on Friday is great. But bio lab was a little distracting on Wednesday afternoons, that's when chem midterms were.",

      "text": "I think those two are about the same quality level so I could recommend O'Toole since she only has a single section of 141 and then one of 240 so may have more time for you and fellow colleagues in the course as 240 is relatively low maintenance to manage vs.. a large intro. Abreu has 2 sections of 141 which historically has been sort of a pain for him to manage from my understanding.",
