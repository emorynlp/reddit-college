      "text": "This class hasn't been offered in forever (in person at least. And given the difference between COVID online renditions of STEM courses and their in person analogs, I have no idea how reliable the people who took it last spring will be) and I don't have a syllabus.  I just remember a friend enjoying it and showing me some of the content/materials.  Do not expect to be learning more signaling pathways and whatnot of the brain (or at least don't expect its focus to be the details of those more so than the experiments and data that tell you they work and how you can inhibit them).  It seemed more experimental biochem/pharmacology(maybe even chemical biology) focused which is good if you haven't taken an MCAT yet and haven't had exposure to much beyond just kinetics and chromatography (note that there will likely be a bigger focus on chemistry, biophysical concepts, and structural biology vs. Just cartoon drawings of pathways and macromolecule interactions) because learning any sort of biochem or cell biology this way helps for an MCAT if pre-med or for graduate level research and courses if you are going that route.\n\nIt probably isn't as good if you expect or desire a more content overload/memorization oriented course (like a lot of biol 301).  I think it is pretty case and active learning oriented as well based upon how my friend described it so beware if you rather sort of just chill in a passive lecture and cram for assessments as they come up.",
