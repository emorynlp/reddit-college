      "text": "I suspect that is a no if AAS is like most (or all?) other departments. I only say most because at one point I think some NBB 190s did count but I think they stopped doing that a while ago.  You are better off confirming this with a Director of Undergraduate Studies and it is not clear if AAS has a person designated as such but maybe it is basically the lady on the sidebar of this page: [http://aas.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/oxford-continuees.html](http://aas.emory.edu/home/undergraduate/oxford-continuees.html)\n\nAdmittedly AAS is quite vague about what constitutes an elective so maybe you'll get lucky.",
