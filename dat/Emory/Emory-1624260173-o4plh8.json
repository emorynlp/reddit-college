      "text": "1)This answer is yes (I think GBS provides a decent amount of info about career outcomes in the BBA section)  I think GBS has one of the highest starting salaries from an undergrad b-school which is impressive since a large chunk stay in Atlanta (which has relatively low cost of living) and since most aren't flocking to IB and stuff. Obviously there are plenty of things to do with the BBA(Emory's at least) and plenty of companies that pay well without overworking people.\n\n2)You may wanna specify what you find confusing about the QTM website so commenters can clear up whatever it is. Is it specifically about the BBA concentration (which isn't necessary. You can end up with great internships and a great job with other concentrations simply due to the quantitative and computational training in many courses)? I find it quite clear even though the major offers lots of pathways and lots of professional development options (some which only majors and minors can access portals and additional info. for). Also if you are thinking you'll do anything QTM related which is not AMS major, you'll want to consider a disciplinary concentration that will be paired with the quant training even if it is the BBA (which will be a little rough I guess).\n\nBTW, unless you are on a serious pre-professional trajectory like pre-health or pre-law, you should be keeping a very open mind about choosing whatever the heck the 'right' job is at this stage. In fact that really shouldn't be on your mind this early as it has so much time to develop and evolve.  However, you can easily research into different options and what their descriptions and salaries are in different regions and take advantage of all the networking QTM/Emory has to guide you.",

              "text": "I don't understand what you mean.  It is basically an \"applied\" statistics major with the applied part meaning that it will try to expose you to more realistic case studies associated with various disciplines (vs. sort of just pure math based statistics) and the range of electives reflects that. It also likely emphasizes statistical computing much more heavily than most stats majors elsewhere. It sort of originated as the project of faculty in the political science department so of course there is bias towards problems that political scientists or policy makers will deal with but it also has some more generic, humanities, and traditional STEM focused electives (though generally treat QTM courses like they are STEM courses. They are run like them, and many courses will have faculty that give exams and problem sets that intentionally challenge students which makes sense since the goal is to not just train students to be obedient and execute taught protocols, but to be able to generally solve a problem or think through a project independently).\n\nAlso, if you were already leaning towards business or whatever, you should recognize that QTM will likely make you sweat intellectually (you have to take higher level maths than just calc. 1 unlike most of your BBA cohort and then some of the higher level core courses and electives expect you to actually use the foundation you gained from say: math 221 and math 210 which is not necessarily even the case for STEM majors like biology and NBB where they want students to take up to calculus 2, but very few courses have students apply knowledge from them) just by itself, but so would CS when added to something like finance (which is allowed and people have done).\n\nI think I see what you are doing:  Trying to slap together major combos that may be the highest yield in terms of lucrative employment aspects, but really a single among the options you are exploring is enough to do that.  You may want to entertain exploring pre-reqs for all such paths in the 1st year and 2nd year and then choose a single pathway and stick to it.  If you want to pick up some extra skills, since you will have a lot of pre-reqs of each covered, you'd be able to take upper division courses in whatever discipline if you for example are in the business school. The exception is QTM which will bar non-majors from some electives.  But you should not feel pressure to do a whole double major. Most jobs aren't looking for specific majors or labels on your transcript so much as evidence of specific skills and skill-sets, so you can develop those without majoring in something (just by dabbling) especially when combined with internships and other experiential learning opps.  Like I think CS is pretty permissive in terms of who takes what after CS 170/CS 171.\n\nEither way, use your first to years to figure out what you actually enjoy learning so you can choose a sensible path that ensures you can graduate on time, perform solidly, and actually have time to truly immerse yourself in whatever department(s) to get mentoring and access to different experimental opps they offer. You don't wanna be caught in a situation where you are only able to sort of do school work for a grade and then never apply what you are doing OR take on majors so heavy that you have to half-ass both or one of the majors.  Figure out what you feel you will enjoy enough to get a full-immersion experience and not just what you think looks on your degree or transcript.  The former will result in better job outcomes. Trust me, the superficial hoop jumping we did in HS to get into college is less valuable from college to employment (or grad. school) and it is much more painful when you don't actually enjoy or see the value in what you are learning.  And you should definitely think twice about some of these if being challenged by the material (and falling short of an A/A- sometimes) will frustrate or deter you (basically, if you are among the many high achievers that only likes something that either comes or is made super easy to them).\n\nBe honest with yourself and determine if you would actually LIKE to engage the more rigorous parts of Emory vs. just tolerate it because you are pressured to \"easily\" get a lucrative job after graduation. The pathways you propose will basically force you to engage it (whereas a BBA alone won't necessarily.  You can get a good job while not being but so challenged in terms of the actual content and cognitive complexity if you don't want that aspect. The main challenge is just the grading curve and many ambitious enough to even consider a CS double major may end up at the upper 1/3 of the class anyway as long as they don't slack).",

                      "text": "Eh...course hero has \"some\" material from QTM and the bschool has a lot of stuff on there.  There are plenty of old math course websites as well slides for newer ones like math 210 that come up if you type \"Emory math 'X'\" on Google. For coursehero just donate some of your HS stuff and then you can some stuff from an Emory course I guess.  I wouldn't worry about it now. Just enjoy the ride and try to talk to upper classmen and RMP with a grain of salt to select the BEST professors you can.  \n\nAnd note that these aren't always the 'easiest' professors (a bad professor can make it such that you score lower or mediocre in a course on exams or psets significantly simpler than a harder prof. with better teacher.  You also want to be careful in cases where the course serves as a foundation for later ones. You don't want to be weaker than peers who had more complex demands in a later course that usually curves grades for example).\n\nEither way, beyond a certain point, looking at materials won't do much because it is so much more specialized than HS and often in STEM oriented and quant areas, exams aren't necessarily written to directly reflect the slides or notes. Many problems could be extensions from it or ask you to derive or make a leap/judgement to solve a problem and unlike HS, many college exams will put a lot of weight on the hardest types of problems at concepts you practiced.  So you can take a look and the material/slides and have no idea of the depth and style of demands on assessment of the material and most classes have very few exams or psets posted on these sites.",

      "text": "I think the guy before me has covered it really well but I\u2019ve done a lot of research on the B-school and stuff. The average starting salary for Finance majors at the B-school is like 80k without bonus and the bonus is like another 12k. This will all likely go up by the time you graduate. The most lucrative thing from the B-school is management consulting and Investment Banking and the b-school is very strong in both and is probably the top school in the south along with Duke, Vandy, and UVA. The Wall Street network is also very good and Emory routinely sends people there. Consulting and placement into Elite boutiques is Emory\u2019s strength. Also recruiting seems to be on the upswing and has reached the point where any finance major who wants will break into at least MM IB. It will probably get even stronger. Also the addition of QSS will probably make you competitive even for hedge funds, Quant research, and data science roles in business. Very few but some do even manage PE out of undergrad which is generally not possible from like any school in the country barring like 15-20",

Basically, approach Emory as if it doesn't \"send\" people anywhere and instead you have to use its resources and academic training to send yourself where you want to go.  This especially goes if you don't have familial or family friend connectivity to these fields.\n\nNo matter which path you choose, expect to work hard academically at Emory and expect to have to network and use professional development resources to build your skills, experience, and resume/profile.  This person likely gives you \"hope\" because they just make it sound like \"the school\" is doing x,y,z, but even if you were at Harvard there are no damned guarantees and you need to keep in mind that your profile will be competing against many strong (as well as well-connected) applicants inside and outside of Emory.  Be deliberate in course selection/skill-development, taking experiential opps, and tapping into networks/learning about different career paths.  Don't just go to Emory (or anywhere), take some classes, get a GPA, and expect major to happen because \"recruitment\" is on an upswing because so is the talent recruited to Emory in the first place.",

          "text": "Y'all really need to wait until you get here instead of making GIANT inferences about what you THINK your research is telling you and what that means for YOU(if anything).  They could look all that stuff about the start salaries up and we really have no idea how recruitment to whatever will perform over time because that is largely up to what students do in the classroom (course selection and performance) and how they leverage co-curricular and extra curricular oppurtunities which is why I tend to emphasize all of that while you, an INCOMING student is always painting things as if simply being at the school is explaining all of this. Emory and those other places you mentioned are very/ultra selective so of course they all have successful placements whether they are a target or not.  What is more important is that they have different student bodies (like VU and really all these places. has a pretty wealthy in comparison to Emory, Duke, and UVa to some extent, so those students are often well-connected in ways they won't tell people and probably don't have to engage the type of rigor of academic curriculum that most from the other 3 do to get it.\n\nFor example, supposedly HOD at VU is known to be a relatively simple major in terms of demands and content, yet it places well partly because it integrates an internship requirement and because many in it are likely pretty well-off.(Well-off/connect, universally high GPAs, internship complete before applying probably helps = success in accessing some of these areas whether you had to stretch yourself academically or not) They generally also seem to target different career paths and cluster in different majors.  If you remove the whole BBA thing, Duke and Emory may be most similar in having a huge cluster of people in or migrating to stats/more quantitative majors whereas at UVA it is econ and their b-school doing much of this and at VU, it is HOD and/or econ (as many with HOD apparently double major).",
