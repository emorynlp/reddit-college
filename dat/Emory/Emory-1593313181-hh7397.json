      "text": "Pro tip for picking classes: make sure you have all your classes in your \u201cshopping cart\u201d before your enrollment window comes up, so when it is your turn, you can enroll instantly. I know some people were fooling around on opus during their enrollment times and lost their class because of it lmao \n\nAlso know that the health class is really easy, it\u2019s literally show up, and like 15 minutes of outside work and get an A. So don\u2019t worry about that being a hard class. Your freshman seminar, while useful for exploration, be wary of the teacher. If the teacher has like 15 bad reviews on ratemyprofessor.com, I\u2019d avoid it even if it was a subject I wanted. Also take a seminar outside of your course of study or intended course of study, it\u2019ll expose you to new people outside of your major (or eventual major). \n\nIf you plan on doing premed, or prebusiness and are for sure wanting to do it, look up the requirements and just hit them ASAP. Your counselors will probably say you have time to explore, but in reality, the sooner youre sure of yourself, the easier your life will be.\n\nYour meetings with your advisor will be generally useful. Just know that it\u2019s more of a heat check, to see if you\u2019re keeping up. It\u2019s a group session where your advisor will just sort of walk through a presentation and take questions. Don\u2019t really expect them to overhaul your schedule unless you schedule a one on one thing. This was all that I could think of right off the bat, if you have anymore questions, I\u2019d be happy to answer! Good luck and welcome to Emory!",

      "text": "Apparrently, y'all have messages targeted directly at you that have kind of already specified some of this information: [http://college.emory.edu/orientation/internal/email-communication/first-year-emails/june-24.html](http://college.emory.edu/orientation/internal/email-communication/first-year-emails/june-24.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep an eye on it I guess: [http://college.emory.edu/orientation/information-for-you/updates-messages.html#coronavirus](http://college.emory.edu/orientation/information-for-you/updates-messages.html#coronavirus)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdvice: Do not be scared or afraid of being challenged for a grade, especially in classes that matter for your career path or are of academic interest.  As a freshman (even 1st semester), try to get GOOD professors and not merely just \"easy\" professors (do not conflate the two.  Again, I know it is hard because students are naturally risk averse, especially those on very GPA sensitive career paths).  Basically, give yourself a \"doable challenge\" freshman year that teaches you to build real study skills/work ethic, think critically (try not to choose professors that only have exams as part of the grade and then those exams only require cramming followed by regurgitation.  Sounds like high school for many.  Why pay or have some donor 70k of tuition for High School 2.0?), etc without overwhelming yourself.  I don't know if I agree on the RMP thing mentioned earlier because some professors just have a lot of ratings so 15 so so or \"bad\" ratings out of 50+ may not be horrible.  Also, take RMP with grains or even chunks of salt because they tend to be full of ratings by people with strong enough opinions in either direction to rate them.  Like if you are taking someone who teaches a 70+ person lecture each year and has been at Emory for a while, I don't know how reliable the ratings are.  I would actually READ the context of the ratings because sometimes they can be really petty and almost be reduced to: \"How dare you challenge me for my grade.  This was supposed to be Emory State University and you were supposed to set the bar low\".  For example, we have this petty rating for Dr. Thomas Bing, which is no doubt the top introductory physics professor at Emory from a person who claimed they made an A:\n\n\"We had at least 2 hours of mandatory HW a night, and that didn't even include studying. **Exams were extremely difficult because he doesn't teach everything you need to know. You need to take what he taught you and apply it to concepts you haven't seen**. Also the class itself is so fast-paced it's very easy to fall behind. Overall I do not recommend\"\n\nFrom the looks of it, appears they took it this summer and this whole rating appears like a complaint about the challenge of an EMORY STEM course during the summer.   How does one expect a slow pace during the summer and why would anyone expect an Emory STEM instructor to write exam items that are identical to homeworks or problems worked in class (the stuff in bold should be a feature and not a bug at a top tier university If you've seen the exact same problem before and then are told to solve it on an exam then it isn't a problem anymore!)? This rater is a problem, but is rare because you'll find that most students DO expect physical sciences instructors to challenge them (which is why he and the top tier chemistry instructors still have very high ratings overall).   And if you are in the life sciences (biology and NBB for example), be extremely careful.  Students come in with \"expectation biases\" where they expect such teachers to be only focused on memorization (despite it being Emory/a high caliber school) because that is how they learned and got As in those subjects in k-12, when they really weren't supposed to be taught and tested that way even then, so you'll see even some awared winning biology teachers (at all levels too, so intro and higher), most who veer away from memorization oriented assessments/approaches to teaching, get a LOT of ratings that look like the physics above. and honestly some teachers in the life sciences with anything above 3.0/5.0 for quality should be considered (now you SHOULD run if a person can't really break like 3.2/5.0 but has like a 3.2 or lower for difficulty. This means that they are being perceived as easy but still get rated poorly!  That is a red flag.  Anyone above or significantly above 3.5 for difficulty but has 3.5+ for quality overall is likely pretty damned good!  That difficulty range is where you should expect to see more naysayers and people complaining about being challenged unexpectatedly and whatnot).  Just figure out if the bad ratings mostly come from perceived \"difficulty\" or if they come from perceived incompetence.\n\nThere is a difference and you'll have to realize that a lot of students, especially those younger students (so that would be the rising sophomores)) taking intro. courses are not that mature and may come in with problematic expectations (such as: \"I was perfect in high school and took the related AP/IB course for this in high school, so I am supposed to be coasting because I already have experience in the area.  If I am not coasting, it must be the teacher's fault for not testing us only on things that they explicitly covered in lecture.  I shouldn't be expected to draw connections or apply what was covered to slightly different stuff\" or \"they were tricky!\" or \"they wrote confusing questions\"...all this, what is often non-sense that essentially says \"you aren't supposed to make me do complex things or answer more complex questions in freshmen courses\")  so you have to consider that context when you read some of these ratings.  Don't take it just face value.  Be really careful because you may miss out on VERY good teachers who really care about students because you bought into bad ratings which in total said \"Ya know, I wasn't expecting to be academically challenged in this way\" which is honestly the job of most of the instructors.  I mean you have people complaining that they had to work and think hard for an A in a STEM class.  No duhhh!  If it wasn't that way, THAT is when you should be concerned that you are paying too much money for Emory.  One could pay far less at a local state school if they wanted to be bored.\n\nI would say above RMP, maybe use us on here as well as upper classmen first to get opinions on professors and courses and try not to be superficial in terms of what you ask for as tempting as it is sometimes.  Beyond whether the person asked if the course was \"easy\" or \"hard\" or whatever, ask if the material seemed interesting, if the professor seemed enthusiastic/tried to really help students learn and develop.  Maybe ask if a typical weekly workload in the course involves going beyond just reviewing notes and reading (I think many gbio classes now have a decent amount of graded HW and still have weekly quizzes, so are more like gen. chem and the physics courses).  Does the instructor just lecture? Is the class flipped/has lots of in-class activities?  Maybe even ask for a syllabus if they have one.  Try to get as much info. as you can because the \"easy\" and \"hard\" stuff can be subjective depending upon the background and academic seriousness of the person you are soliciting information from.",

              "text": "I think people over estimate how GPA defined it is (it certainly is but people act as if you need to CONTRIVE a 4.0 and keeping 3.5-3.7+ in GBS or econ. isn't hard even with challenging instructors).  And also, it is kind of tricky with GBS because because the options are restricted and you'd be in competition with students who can handle more classes and think better than you because maybe they took better classes when back in ECAS and STILL did well.   I say folks should just not go to Emory for finance or anything if you'll dodge that and would keep in mind that you still need reference letters and some would come from professors.  Who do you think would write the better ones? Those who challenge students for the A or those who know they make it super easy? Think about the whole picture. Again, there are ways to expose yourself to the proper level of learning and academic challenge without overwhelming yourself such that you can't do well.   I've seen lots of people go out of their way to contrive a high GPA in ECAS to get into GBS by taking ultra light course loads or only joke courses go on to under perform in GBS where the course load is consistently heavier per semester and the courses are harder/curved and more competitive.  \n\nSomeone used to thinking and working and still performing well is primed to do well in GBS on a consistent basis which is probably why lots of double majors (GBS/ECAS) do EXTREMELY well and place well too.  \n\n The problem is that you and others frame it from the vantagepoint of DEFEAT before you even get in the course with the types of professors I am talking about.  That is essentially admitting \"I can't handle a challenge even with a great instructor. If they are challenging me, it means I won't make the A\" and should make you question why you'd think you can handle finance which is very intensive in terms of hours and intellectual demands at times.   Don't use that attitude. Have a growth mindset and keep the WHOLE picture in mind like:\"who cares about me as a student? Who will really reward me for putting in the work?\".  College professors do not flippantly write strong rec. letters because someone got an A in their class. \n\nEven in more challenging courses, PLENTY of people make A grades.  Like on the harshest GBS and econ. curves for core courses, 35% make some sort of A.  You have to find other ways to stand out in such environments.  \n\n*You have to find a balance that allows for and then assumes that you can do well in a challenging instructor's course. Emory is a waste of money if you feel like you must actively dodge most of them and again, if you are pre-GBS or even doing econ, you may not have many choices.  And remember that your goal is to TRAIN for whatever position so that you can adjust to it well and do well at it.   It isn't to just \"get there\"(you need to probably go through internships first anyway).  Think of the journey in between and about what courses taught by who is serious about giving you the skills needed in that field.  Think beyond the superficial \"who will make me do the least for an A\" because those people aren't always good and often don't really care about you. Trust me..  Find your battles to pick that are worthwhile and important for your development or developing a work ethic/whatever and then find easier courses to balance those out and afford you the time to maximize your performance in the \"battle class\".  That is how I view it.  You'll know who and what these classes are because they are pretty well celebrated even by students that came up short and didn't make the A range.  They are the ones where merely doing decently means you learned a lot of useful stuff or skills and they are highly appreciated.  One such class is apparently B-law with Allison Burdette(sp?) in GBS but I believe she is unavoidable because all students must take it. I forget. But there are a few others.   Either way, don't assume that an A is ridiculously hard in a challenging course. That isn't always the case. A lot of them end up with grades curved UP at the end anyway.  When I say \"challenging\" I refer to cognitive complexity of demands and not just grading.  The two don't always inversely correlate.  Some teachers who know they are asking students to do more will provide lots more oppurtunities for students to get a strong final grade whereas an \"easier\" class may require near perfection that most won't hit (God forbid you take an easy GBS class where grades get curved down vs. normal scale or an econ. with an A cutoff of 96 because they know they made it a little too easy cognitively)",

The professors are overwhelmed too and the infrastructure doesn't support the online stuff as well as in person (style of assignments has to be changed and whatnot).  A semester like the one coming up (and maybe spring) is fairly risk free in comparison to average in person semesters.  Even \"challenging\" classes end up less challenging due to the conditions.   It should be a prime oppurtunity to do well in whatever without freaking out.  Just do what you want to do/take interesting classes within reason. And if you are going to GBS, of course you should use AP where available to get out of some of those pre-reqs.  Just move on.   Calc. 1 is harder than most expect, Dsci is too in comparison to AP stats. Econ.  If you have AP for one of them, then the other is very doable. Unlike some STEM classes like chemistry, intro. econ is not \"special\". Those who use AP won't be at a disadvantage.  Econ 101 and 112 are really basic. Hell, you can also take business econ. if you plan on going to GBS and that will fullfill ALL of the econ. requirement.  If you have all those, what you could ask yourself and a counselor is if you are ready to try something like financial accounting. But again, I don't know what you are majoring in. I only assume it is business/finance, but there are multiple pathways to IB.",

You basically just need to be in the top 70% or so to get a B.  And looks like this course is taken by a lot of older b-school students so after/during recruitment anyways).\n\nAlso, here is a nice article that discusses GPA.   Keeping a 3.5 at Emory (or any top school), even with a few tried and true challenging courses as a non-STEM major isn't hard at all: [https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/low-gpa-investment-banking/](https://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/low-gpa-investment-banking/)\n\nIt looks like they also account for selectivity/competitiveness of the school along with major to some extent.  What you want to do is do the best you can overall, but do especially well in courses that MATTER.  Like the article mentions frontloading easier courses, but that is a little hard to do/be meaningful when you are going to join a 2 year BBA program, meaning that you need to do well in financial accounting and also calc. 1 (note that this is now standardized, so no, you can't just find an easier teacher) and Dsci (I think teachers for this are usually very similar intensity/style but doesn't matter because it is fit to the distribution below anyway) if you don't have AP credits for those.  If you do, dodge them and take some more GERs and things that teach you to think and write.  It's a win win because they emphasize those skills, are decently challenging, but likely assign mostly As if you just do solid work.  They don't overwhelm.  The GERs, as long as you don't take advanced courses that clearly build upon previous courses or take someone who is absolutely insane just cause, you shouldn't have many problems even if the teachers do have some useful rigor.  If you are not pre-business and majoring in something else, then this means you NEED to do well in intro. courses in that major, and those are typically giving lower grades for a variety of reasons.  \n\nAgain, those courses may not have professor level options or they may be effectively standardized where they use the same tests, case studies, assignments, and general course structure.  No matter how objectively challenging/busy the course is, you'll be graded on the distribution:  [https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/curriculum/standards](https://goizueta.emory.edu/undergraduate-business-degree/curriculum/standards)\n\nSo you need to just perform well vs. peers.  Now you can choose alternative pathways/majors, but unless they are STEM, the threshold for GPA expectations increases even more and if you choose the smaller humanities majors, you'll end up with less choices not due to quality control but due to faculty availability.   Even in the higher grading social sciences humanities, often there will be quite a few teaching core courses (especially introductory and intermediate levels) that find some way to dole out lots of Bs regardless of how objectively busy/difficult their course is (and in things like philosophy, some may just find things like logic hard.  Others will find more writing intensive courses harder for them, and whatnot).  Your \"choices\" and ability to take the supposedly easier courses/professors may mostly appear once electives open up in some majors, so the sooner the better. Electives and special topics courses naturally have less standardization/quality control.",

They usually make it such that you can log-in via your username/password and view course evals.  Again, this is like the syllabus thing.  Many other universities, even other top tiers that also like to be so secretive about their academics, integrate current and past syllabi from sections into their course atlases/registration softwares and they clearly encourage wide participation.  Given the level of professor variation in teaching at Emory, this could also be great for students and help students put together information from evals with how a course is run (because again, too many students just talk about grades and \"difficulty\" in evals.  Honestly, I would only use the written portion of student evals if available and ignore the bubble-in portions because the latter is notoriously unreliable because students are often neutral and a) just trying to get it done or b) predict a grade they didn't want so often punish the professor in the bubble-in section just for that.  The correlation with expected grades is just way too high).",
