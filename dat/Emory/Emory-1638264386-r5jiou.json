My roommate has been pretty inconsiderate and it only got worse recently, he snores very loudly at night to a point where eye masks+ ear plugs arent enough. It's gotten to a point where its affecting my phsyical and mental health but I'm not sure if I could get a room change without any medical disabilities. Is it possible to change rooms without having someone to swap with and  who should I talk to?",

I applied for a change during the window in January last year and got approved, but it wasn't until late Feb that I actually got a new room because they kept assigning me rooms that weren't available (3 times!)\n\nIt got to a point where I was showing up to the housing office in-person every day for a week.",
