  "text": "I had a blast in the class this year with Joel Silverman, but he says that he needs more people enrolled in the course to keep it going.\n\nIt's digital photography focused, and Joel let me know that if you have basic knowledge of how to operate a dslr he can override your photo I requirement.\n\nThought I'd include a hint of what you might work on if you join. This is a cyanotype I made for the class.\n\n\\*edit: He needs new people by friday so hurry if interested!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xecbd6y90w261.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be20a134350a9e1ebb3878954261ec52404504c",

I was on the editorial board as the Photography Editor and president of photography club. I actually wished since I enrolled at Emory that I could skip Photo 1 so I could learn new photography skills. \n\nI also have my own DSLR, a Canon 80D, which I can use for coursework. \n\nThis sounds perfect for me and I'd be super interested. What do I have to do?",
