Admittedly, Emory econ. courses seems to have become more math oriented overtime (and their adding little \"labs\" to courses for experiential/computational components).  Some of Emory's close ranked peers didn't even require econometrics until fairly recently.  Given all this, it may deserve the designation more than others but there is some politics behind this move.",

One thing that is true is that they get insanely talented students because of the reputation of that program and many of the faculty in it.  It is kind of amazing that it happened to become one of Emory's undergraduate strengths, but I think Emory gets this JHU sort of treatment where most people assume it is only superlatively good in areas you expect top tier schools to be good at (namely STEM), but it is actually super strong in many other areas that one may expect to only be strong at say..an LACs.",
