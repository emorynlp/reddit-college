  "text": "Covid and online learning are really difficult for me, and I had a really bad depressive episode for the last two weeks and got super behind in chemistry. I don't think I'll pass at this point. \n\nI want out of chem, but I'm finding it difficult to find any resources for withdrawing. \n\nI'm a second year and I'll have 12 credit hours if I drop this course. Can anyone point me in the right direction?",

      "text": "I believe that extended partial withdrawal is only allowed in your first 2 semesters (so you are not eligible). \n\nTalk to an OUE advisor about your options. If you need a medical intervention (like intensive psychiatric treatment), then with a doctor's approval and permission from the dean, you may be able to withdraw from all your courses. A less intense option might be to take an incomplete in Chemistry if you feel you are not currently able to finish the class due to a mental health crisis (but think you can finish your other classes). You will have to complete the class, but you'll have more time. \n\nAgain, you need to talk to an advisor (and perhaps your chemistry professor) to see what options you have. Remember that neither your professor, your advisors, or Emory want to see you fail. But to get help, you have to ask for help.\n\nAnd finally, if you do fail, know that it's not the end of the world. Plenty of folks fail a college class, but still graduate and have happy successful lives.  College grades generally don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things and I think there will be extra understanding for Covid era grades",

          "text": "Ah. That's unfortunate. Thank you for the information though. \n\nI've sent an email and am planning to meet with my advisor. I've made them pretty aware of my general state recently. Medical intervention is probably more trouble than it's worth. It's never done anything for me aside from rack up a bill haha. I think I can finish my other courses, so I'll look into an incomplete. Thank you.\n\nI feel like I'm in hell; this semester can't end soon enough.",
