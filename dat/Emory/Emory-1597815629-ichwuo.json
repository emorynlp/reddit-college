  "title:": "[GUIDE] Courses That Require Using Emory's VPN",
  "text": "I had to do this for one of my courses and it's ridiculous. CHEM 203L students, you'll need this. You have to download a licensed modeling software that is only usable when you're connected to Emory's servers. If anyone else has a course that needs to use Emory's VPN and they're living off-campus, here's how to set it up. Mods u/oldeaglenewute2022, u/OrangElm, and u/jackschnei please verify. \n\n\n**STANDALONE INSTALLER METHOD:**\n\n* Head to Emory's VPN Tools website: [VPN Tools](http://it.emory.edu/vpntools/). Download whatever standalone client works for you (Windows/Mac).\n\n* Install the standalone client. It should be called BIG-IP Edge Client. Open the application and log in with your Emory credentials.\n\n* Click Connect. Make sure that the VPN is set to vpn.emory.edu. Disconnect when you're done using the program.\n\n**BROWSER EXTENSION METHOD:**\n\nImgur album guide is [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/9taPXPk). This is a Windows 10 guide and is .\n\n* Use Chrome to set this all up. I primarily use Firefox but occasionally it's incompatible with certain extensions. This method works on Chrome.\n\n* Google \"Emory VPN\" or use this link to access it to log in with your student ID and password: [Emory VPN](https://vpn.emory.edu)\n\n* You won't have the browser app needed to use this function because this is your first time. A dialog box will open and you need to click \"More Options.\" See [image](https://i.imgur.com/TQRb1C7.png).\n\n* Click \"Install/Reinstall Endpoint Inspector.\" It will prompt you to download a file called \"f5epi_setup.exe\" and you will need to allow administrator privileges when prompted. See [image](https://i.imgur.com/t4KQSei.png).\n\n* Follow the download prompt. You will not get an \"Installation Complete\" notification; it just disappears when it's done. Doesn't take more than 5 seconds typically. Follow Step #2. See [image](https://i.imgur.com/FSavsV7.png).\n\n* You may have to log in again depending on how long it's been. Once you're in and are able to use the browser app to log in, click this panel called \"EmoryNetworkCores_NA.\" See [image](https://i.imgur.com/OSh0UPB.png).\n\n* You will be prompted to download a file called \"f5vpn_setup.exe\" because you won't have it. Go ahead and install. That is the application that actually allows you to use Emory's VPN when you click the panel.\n\n* The installed application is automatically opened when you click the panel. It will connect you to Emory's VPN. This is the window that shows information regarding your connection. Now you can use certain licensed software that requires you to be in Emory's servers to work (e.g. Spartan Student Edition V8). See [image](https://i.imgur.com/A7zC6My.png).",

I'll let the others verify.  Good luck with 203-L (Spartan can be slow as hell doing the calculations too..I don't prefer it)!",

          "text": "I have never used Spartan before, but there's always a first time for everything. I didn't bother checking for a standalone client but thankfully u/schumi23 chimed in with the link. That makes things a lot simpler but I'll leave the browser extension method up in case they want to use that.",

If this helps at least one person, I'll be gucci at the end of the day.",
