  "text": "Hey all. I've been toying with the idea of getting an emotional support dog some time in the future(at oxford) for anxiety.  was wondering if anyone knows of them on campus and what the rules are surrounding them. Would I need a single? How big could the dog be? Are they widely accepted? Any info would be helpful. Thanks",
