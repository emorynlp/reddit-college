  "text": "I\u2019m planning to take Chem 150 in the fall. I personally have a weak background on the subject and I\u2019m considering to enroll in Kindt\u2019s online section. For those of you that had taken him online fall of 2020, would you recommend him? How difficult was his class out of 10? I couldn\u2019t find answers to my questions on RatemyP as most of his ratings were from his 202 class.",

      "text": "I took him, his class was medium hard but I doubt there's an easy chem 150 class last fall. He cares about his student's learning so he'll answer questions in lectures and sometimes that is great while other times it ends up being 15 minutes on something we don't need to know for class. It can be interesting though. There were a bunch of quizzes graded just on completion then some that were graded on accuracy. Do well on the aleks knowledge checks, that will lead to less aleks homework later on. Tests are fairly hard, but outside of that I didn't think anything was too difficult. I got an A and definitely had to study for tests, but I've taken harder classes.",

          "text": "What I would warn OP about is that the pace and arrangement of topics and the calibre of exams is different for in person 150/202 (and really most of the STEM classes).  Like 150 or 202 exams even with an \"easier\" professor during in person learning is a bit tougher than the exams given during  Covid and the Covid exams for 150 and 202 online sections were standardized. \n\n They will have to seriously work regardless and I figure they may as well choose an instructor who can teach the conceptual and structural/ochem stuff better than kindt. I'd have to wonder if Kindt returns for 202 which may be another factor. Like he may be handing students with a shakier ochem foundation off to harder professors for 202 .  Admittedly Kindt likes math so maybe his students can funnel to Mulford if Kindt doesn't return (or even if he does. Mulford does the math and ochem stuff a bit better tbh and that can be beneficial for 203 which is probably \"returning to normal\" as early as this fall)",

      "text": "Also I think you should NOT enroll in online if you go to campus and you may not even be allowed to.   They may not even offer online chem in spring and you need a strong foundation for 202. Chem 150 is NOT designed for people with backgrounds and in fact is meant to sort of even reorient how those with a background think about chemistry (which is mostly math if they did AP) so those with experience will have most of their advantage on exam 1 where much of the material overlaps and then the playing field sort of levels off as the course progresses because they start emphasizing a very conceptual framework.  Take the strongest/most effective instructor you can for 150. \n\n If you don't like it or don't do as well as you want, then maybe seek an easier 202 option.  But best to go into a medium, hard, or easier 202 prof. With a strong work ethic and conceptual framework from 150 then to have a slightly weaker one and then risk ending up stranded with tough 202 options where most students have better training or who are used to taking tougher exams.  If things were like last year with Covid, I wouldn't care much because of the amount of standardization, but this slightly post-Covid environment means these courses will likely be kicked up a notch and you'll be more likely to be held accountable for previous 150 material in chem 202, especially the ochem and more conceptual stuff. Heirarchy and foundational knowledge matters as you progress through chem courses more so than say...bio (or even physics where E&M may or may not click for people good at mechanics and vice versa because they require different styles of thinking).\n\nEdit: I'm pretty sure the course atlas for 150 at one point(not anymore. 150 removed the more detailed info it had at one point) stated that Kindt's online section was reserved for those not returning to campus. Also, you should worry that Kindt will likely try to be fair and give the online section the same tests as his in person section and those tests will likely be substantially harder than last fall's if it was anything like previous(non-Covid) years of 150.  And people who took the online 150 last fall found even the tests they were given kind of tough perhaps due to the online/virtual learning structure and environment.  Averages were apparently similar in normal in person years with the harder exams which is telling.",
