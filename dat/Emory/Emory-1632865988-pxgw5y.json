      "text": "Are you on main campus or Clairmont? If you are at Clairmont you don't have to fill anything out. If you are at main typically there is an application process and they will move you to Clairmont during the break (so you have a kitchen). The app isn't out yet but it typically comes out mid October. You can email them in a few weeks and see if it's up yet.",
