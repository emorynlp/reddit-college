  "text": "Hello, I am a HS student considering Emory, and so far I really like the programs and interdisciplinary nature of the school.  However, I have a few questions about life at Emory. \n\n1.  I would like to go to a school that is diverse in many ways: racially, socio-economically, geographically, and ideologically.  This includes political diversity.  While I know that professors and students at most elite colleges are mostly liberal, how fair are professors towards political views they do not agree with?  Do they bring their personal politics into the classroom and/or not respect other political opinions?  How do they treat religion?  Do they respect religious beliefs or mock them? Obviously, each professor is different; I am just curious about trends.\n2. Emory's website says that they highly value service.  Is this interest reflected in the student body?  Emory seems most interested in diversity and service from their mission statement but based on real-life experience, what qualities do the students seem to value?\n3. Has anyone taken the Voluntary Core Curriculum?  What were the classes like?  How much do you think it helped your education?",

          "text": "I pretty much agree with all you said but I'd revise 2. to say that many are going to do \"service\" whether they are intrinsically service oriented or not to pad their resume because Emory, like other top tier schools is full of world class hoop jumpers and if service appears to be a high yield hoop, many will jump through it whether they enjoy it or not.  What I will say is that Emory seems to value that in admissions in ways that other schools may not. Like it has more room to target those types because while its stats definitely are that of a super high achieving student body, Emory has not yet become a stats whore Tier 2ish elite private (there are maybe 2-3 I can think of easily) desperately chasing after tier 1 Ivy/Ivy Plus (Harvard and crew) stats without doing much to chase the other attributes that make those schools highly successful primarily because they were trying to massage rankings before the formula changed to diminish the value of selectivity.\n\n\nEdit: I've heard that Voluntary Core experiences and courses can be great for those who are serious about developing their writing skills and who want to engage with faculty and scholars more closely.  Definitely a good path for folks that lean more in the direction of wanting more intellectual engagement as part of their early UG experience, plus it definitely has many of the top tier social science and humanities teaching a course so connecting with them is a plus. However beware, many of these folks have high standards in writing, in class discussions of readings, etc.",

      "text": "I can comment a bit on 3. I've taken around 3 VCC courses and I really do think they are a lot of fun. I think they really offer an opportunity to explore humanities/liberal arts outside of my STEM major in a relatively low-stress environment. The professors are really invested in your intellectual growth and one of these classes even lead to a research experience for me which was also really interesting. The classes, for the most part, are discussion and/or writing focused which really allows you to engage with the texts critically. I think normally, you are also required to attend some lectures outside of class which can be annoying, but they relaxed some of those restrictions due to COVID.",
