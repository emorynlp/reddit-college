      "text": "Not a freshman on my first year, I was a transfer. So I hope it's okay sharing what I thought were cool.\n\nI took CS 170 and I learned a lot. It might be too rough as a \"free credit\" class and it is truly a big chunk of your time with timesink assignments and quizzes every Friday that you *have* to keep up with. At the end of it, you'll have a thorough introduction to Java and you'll have some exposure to the computer science world. I ended up taking CS 171 and CS 224 right after before deciding CS wasn't worth mixing in with premed at the moment (maybe after).\n\nQTM 150 was on a similar vein, except way easier. You learn how to program in R and it's a 1-credit course. It's a two-course sequence with QTM 151 following it but I only took QTM 150. It'll only count for a QSS major but if you have space for one credit to specifically learn R then you might as well. If you need QTM 100 for your major, don't bother since you'll learn a bit of R there (not as focused, though).\n\nI also recommend ANT 101 since anthropology itself is very holistic and interdisciplinary. You might find something in that huge field that might interest you. Archaeology, linguistics, biology, and culture. Those are the four fields under the umbrella of anthropology, with hints of religion, sexuality, and psychology. On top of that, it's just a pretty chill course in general and fulfills the HSC requirement.",

What I did was look for classes 385 in subjects that were interesting to me but not needed for my major! And even though they are labeled 385, they often don't have pre-requisites nor are \\*too\\* challenging, but look at the syllabus before a/d/s ends to ensure you can handle the course load. I have also seen some labeled 285 as well that follow the same standards.",

It's a tour of sorts through philosophers from Ancient Greece to modern day and their theories on what it means to live well or to have lived a good life. I had Professor Stuhr and would recommend him, but it was definitely intense - we had a 300 word paper due each class on the reading assignment that I really struggled with initially, but I feel has made me a much better reader and helped me focus my writing more. Overall a very interesting class that I personally benefitted from a lot - from what I've heard, other professors are less demanding.\n\nIntro to logic (PHIL 110) is also a valuable course that I just finished this summer - formal logic wasnt entirely my jam, but it was still pretty interesting stuff, and evaluating arguments and learning fallacies as part of being able to construct a better argument is definitely a valuable skill.",
