      "text": "I originally wanted to get a degree in biology to work with animals. I came to that decision at the start of high school. I held onto that dream throughout high school. Then, my first semester of college comes and halfway through it I realize that majoring in biology might not be the best choice for me. I did not like taking science classes because a lot of the topics just weren't that interesting to me. I also wasn't very good at science classes. I just always struggled through them.\n\nI was at a loss, though, of what to do. I started to reflect on myself. What did I like to do? What are my interests? What am I good at? Answering these questions for myself actually gave me the answer I needed. I thought about becoming a high school English/writing teacher since those were always my favorite subjects in school. I still wasn't sure, though, because I knew that teachers get treated like crap. It wasn't until I had a conversation with my English professor that I really realized that teaching my favorite, best subject would be something I would love to do. I love to read and write and I've always done excellent in my English classes. I always seemed to love English since I was a child. Now, I am pursuing a degree in English Education. I hope to become a high school teacher and maybe one day a professor. \n\nSo, what I'm trying to say is that inspiration can come from anywhere. Mine came from my English professor. If I hadn't been in that class and hadn't had her as a professor, I might not have realized my dream. My best advice to you is reflect on your life. What are your interests? What are you good at doing? Also, make sure it's something that you are actually going to enjoy. Don't pick something because it's the best paying job or has a high demand. It's okay to consider those factors but don't make them the final deciding factor. You probably want to enjoy what you do and if you are spending thousands of dollars to get a degree in it, you want to make sure you don't regret it. Research will also be your friend. Look up careers that go with majors that interest you. Take career assessments. The more information you have, the better decision you can come to. I hope this helped! (Sorry for long story. Wanted to show you where I got my inspiration from.)",

      "text": "I wanted to major in some sort of engineering, but Chapman University didn't really have an engineering major like mechanical or electrical (well... they had a partner program with UCI, but no one really did it). I was 18 and naive so I went for the closest thing to it and selected math.\n\nI committed fully and bought a bunch of books that would talk about mathematicians and all that so I could gain my interest. After I got my bearings set I took as many math courses that I could. I was determined to graduate early or at least finish my major early. I eventually had to take computer science in my sophomore year.\n\nComputer science was really difficult, but the job market made me really excited since I would have a lot of student loans. I decided to get a minor in computer science. After a semester I decided to switch my major to computer science. Since I had done so many math courses by that time, my advisor told me that I should try to double major and if I couldn't do it, that I would just pick the one that I wanted more (there were a lot of overlap).\n\nI graduated with a double major in math and computer science. Tbh I don't think the double major helped me out in my career as much as I would have thought. It is NOT seen as two degrees, it's seen more as if you were maybe a little more busy in college than your piers.\n\nI graduated high school in 2008 when housing market was crashing was happening. I was very timid going into college and feared I wouldn't be able to get a job. I also went to a private school and racked up about $200k in student loans. I was highly motivated to pay them off and I needed a good job.",

      "text": "How I came to choose my major was in the identification of areas of study that I enjoyed, which are geology, history, and biology. I wasn\u2019t really that keen on focusing on only one of those and a triple major would be ridiculous, so I decided to find a field that combined all my interests, which ended up being Anthropology. So, that motivated me in a sense because I could still get decent exposure to all three fields. However, the real motivation that kept me in the field was after taking my first excavation class. I enjoy archaeological lectures, but actually excavating and working in the field is something that cannot be beaten!\n\nSo, I\u2019d go with something that sounds genuinely interesting to you. Then, take a class or two that are within the field that look interesting and see if you enjoy it. If you do, then stick with it and build up your plans for what you\u2019ll do after graduation.",
