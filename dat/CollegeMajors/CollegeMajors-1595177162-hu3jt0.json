      "text": "You should be fine. In CS and cyber security degrees they usually require you to take some programming fundamentals courses so you shouldn't worry about your current lack of programming experience. The more you learn and know before school always helps though.\n\nI've met some people who had never programmed until college and they were able to get through.",
