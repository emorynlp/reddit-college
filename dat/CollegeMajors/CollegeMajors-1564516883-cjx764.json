  "title:": "Going to college next year undeclared",
  "text": "As an incoming first year who has no dream career yet, I was hoping to get some advice about choosing a major.\n\nIn high school I excelled at calculus and Physics ( mechanics + E&M) and generally enjoyed learning cool things about how our world works and being passionate rather then being anal about grades. I also did a research project on how commercial honeybees respond to non ionizing radiation. I enjoyed doing the research and learning things on the way, but don't see myself being a researcher as a profession.\n\nI've considered joining the military becuase I like the idea of doing weapons engineering or something of the sort, but otherwise, I feel like I might just end up majoring in some random engineering field in college and getting a job that is ultimately not related to engineering. \n\nIf anyone has any thoughts about what someone like myself should do, or knows anyone I can talk to, I'd greatly appreciate it.",
