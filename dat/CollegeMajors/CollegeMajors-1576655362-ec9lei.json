  "text": "How does it differ from a straight-up mathematics degree in terms of classes?\n\nWhat are the pros and cons of this degree?\n\nWhat job opportunities does it open up? If, say, I were to pursue a masters in economics would this bachelors degree serve me well?\n\nThanks for any input! I\u2019m just looking for some general discussion here so it\u2019s all on the table :)",

      "text": "Usually it will require courses outside mathematics. Economics is a frequent option although some are more narrowly focused on the physical sciences. Some go as far as requiring a minor in a cognate discipline. It is also very common for it to require more programming and stats than a pure math degree. \n\nWhat's omitted? Some of the advanced pure mathematics courses need to be left out of the default program to make room for this.\n\nRe: Your comment about economics -- there are a few places that have an undergraduate degree in mathematical economics as well.",
