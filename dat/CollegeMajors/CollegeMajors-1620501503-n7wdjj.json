  "text": "I'm trying to choose between these two tracks: \n\n* Environmental science major, bioinformatics minor, philosophy minor\n* Bioinformatics major, environmental science minor, philosophy minor\n\nMy questions: \n\n1. What different jobs could I get with each track? I have a general idea, but it's always good to have some more input. \n2. I took AP Calculus BC and Calculus III (multivariable calculus) in high school. I did well in these classes, but I took them a few years ago and can't remember most of the content. I would preferably like to use AP credit to fulfill one of my math credits. My question is how important is calculus to bioinformatics? How much math is actually used? (I'll talk to my counselor about this too)\n3. How difficult would it be to have 2 minors? I'm also going to be playing D1 soccer and we practice 3-4 hours per day. \n\nI would also appreciate other advice/comments",

      "text": "What is your intent for having two minors? Keep in mind a minor is usually 18 credits (~6 classes) at most schools. That means 36 credits that may or may not count towards your major. That is a ton of extra time and work for something that doesn\u2019t always mean much to employers (your major matters way, way more). \n\nI can\u2019t really speak for environmental science, but bioinformatics is a very hot field with very high demand right now (especially with COVID, a ton of jobs will continue to pop up). Your strong math background makes you an excellent candidate for working in data science or data engineering. Maybe browse some of those topics and see if they appeal to you! \n\nI do have friends who were environmental science majors and I will say *all* of them who wanted to work in the field had to go back for a masters or PhD. Bioinformatics doesn\u2019t necessarily require the same because of its tech orientation.",

          "text": "Thank you for the advice!\n\nMy sister had two minors (computer science major, math minor, Japanese minor), so I thought it would be alright. \n\nI was leaning toward my second track (bioinformatics major, environmental science minor, philosophy minor) before, but I also looked into data science and it sounds like a good option (I've taken AP Statistics, so this helps some too). My school offers a data science major, but not a minor. I might go with a data science major with a bioinformatics minor and aim for a philosophy minor if I have the time. The data science major is 65 hours of major courses, the bioinformatics minor is 18, and the philosophy minor is 15 (if I go through with it). I'm new to all this, so I'll also be sure to check in with my counselor to see what they think.",
