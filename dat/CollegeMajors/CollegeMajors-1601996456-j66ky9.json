  "text": "Hi, I'm a senior in high school and I'm struggling to choose the kind of engineering I want to do. Ideally, in the future I would like to open a firm which works with large corporations to prevent, dispose of,  and re-purpose waste in the most green way possible. I want to specifically focus on chemical waste. I'm especially drawn to chemistry and I'm not extremely interested in water quality and air quality. However, I want my degree to actually allow me to help the environment or at the very least NOT HARM THE ENVIRONMENT. So which one should I choose?",
