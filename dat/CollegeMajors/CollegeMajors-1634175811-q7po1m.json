  "text": "I can\u2019t decide which of these majors to pick in. \n\nI\u2019m currently at community college as a 18 yo freshman and have a couple factors that are impacting my choice. \n\nMy family is in poor financial standing for the long term so I feel the urgency to make money soon, and these are both solid degrees/careers able to make six figure salary\u2019s.\n\nI also urgently want to move out and be more independent on my own, so there\u2019s that too.\n\nI\u2019m more of a big picture thinker and struggle with lots of details, as I can forget, but I like stuff like strategy and planning and stuff like that. I\u2019m good at being social too, but not too much. I like to work with my mind and be intellectually challenged.\n\nI think computer information systems is already a great choice, i think I\u2019ll be able to graduate definitely, has great career prospects and salaries, etc. I can graduate in 4 years.\n\nBut I\u2019ve also been looking at pre-engineering and becoming an engineer working on really interesting stuff like robots and computer parts and stuff. \n\nIt would take me 5 years to graduate, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll fail the more difficult classes and be held back and take longer\n\nI\u2019m interested in science and technology. Math is not my strong suit, but I\u2019m willing to work on it of course.\n\nI think my strongest skills is writing, and getting my thoughts into paper, but I don\u2019t think any writing related degree would lead to good career prospects.\n\nI can\u2019t do something like computer science because it starts at calculus and I\u2019m starting at precalculus so that\u2019s off the table.\n\nBoth of these degrees would lead to me likely sitting on a computer looking at a screen pretty much, right? \n\nI could become a software developer too with just the information systems degree and some self-teaching which can lead to interesting jobs\n\nBut engineers can also do more variety of activities (more hardware related) and can see their inventions come to life physically. and that interests me too because I do like variety.\n\nBasically I\u2019m worried wether information systems would get boring and there\u2019s better, more interesting work to be done in engineering. Or if it\u2019s just a different type of work? \n\nIs it really worth taking the risk of failing badly in debt with possibly no degree for engineering work? \n\nWhat do you guys think? Should I take the safer option and do information systems or fuck it full send and go for pre-engineering?\n\nI keep going back and forth between these two, I\u2019m super conflicted.\n\nOr something else?",

      "text": "Are you talking about bachelor or associates degree. \n\nI'm not very knowledgeable about pre-engineering, but I would have to think it's less useful than information systems\n\nHonestly, you don't necessarily need much education to get into IT. To jump into the field you can just get a couple certifications and maybe an associate's degree. If you know what you want to do within IT and are good at it, you can manage to work your way up to a really nice salary, possibly without much college education.\n\nTake some time to explore your interests and options. Get a part time job in some form of IT to try it out.",

              "text": "You could also consider that your associates may not matter that much for when you get a bachelor's. Sure pre-engineering will prepare you more for engineering classes, but it's not necessary. \n\nI think a information systems associates degree can be fairly valuable alone. If you wanted to go into engineering after for bachelors you absolutely still could.\n\nI'm not saying you should pick what you want to do solely based off salary and career opportunities, but do something you actually enjoy.",

                  "text": "Really, I can? The farthest information systems goes into math is like calculus 1 and that\u2019s it, no physics or any other sciences, or engineering electives.\n\nI think i have to really just commit to either more science and math or just technology but i see good upsides to both of these paths so it\u2019s hard, \n\nI think i might just take the risk and go engineering because I can always go back to IT, and it doesn\u2019t seem to work the same in reverse.",

Note that both can be six fogure salaries. One thing to note is that you don't always need a degree (BS or AS) to get a support role, sometimes you only need to pass the comptia/cisco exams. If income was urgent and I was in your position, I would look at postings for level 1 tech support positions in your area and base my decision from therr. Do they require a degree, or just a cert?",
