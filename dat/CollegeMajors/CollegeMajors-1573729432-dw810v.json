  "text": "Hello, I am considering putting down computational biology as a possible secondary major on my college applications (specifically UPenn)  but I have my concerns. I have a love for computer science which is the main reason for considering this major. Additionally, I have a spent a lot of time in the past year in the hospital and have accrued an interest in medicine during this time. I genuinely want to help people in the medical realm and I think using computer science would be what is most appropriate for me. The thing is despite me having spent a lot of time in the hospital and seeing a lot of things I never thought I would and getting surgeries done I never thought I would, I am still a very squeamish person. As a kid I would faint at the sight of blood. Although I have gotten less squeamish since then I still have to admit that a lot of things make me light headed. So I guess what I am asking is how intensive is computational biology? I know you don\u2019t know enough about me to say for sure but if you have taken it or know a lot about it let me know what you think. Thanks so much for your time.",
