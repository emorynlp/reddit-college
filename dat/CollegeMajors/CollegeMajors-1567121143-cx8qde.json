  "text": "Hello! \nI am currently a second year college student pursuing chem major/pre-pharmacy. After reconsidering my future career plans, I decided to switch into either biochemistry or computer science. This is because I would like to be creative at work (drug design and formulation or video game design/ 3D modeling..) while being able to apply the principles of science and mathematics respectively. I find certain aspects to be interesting in each field and can\u2019t  decide which major to choose due to the fact that I haven\u2019t had a computer science related experience. Moreover, I have spent two years studying chemistry and biology courses so my parents tell me that changing at this stage wouldn\u2019t be the best option. I am confused since I feel that cmpsci provides me with the thrill of being continually challenged but would also make me a little bit regret leaving the healthcare field. I feel passionate about scientific research especially how chemistry can affect our bodies and contribute to the human psychology. But I also love mathematics and never mind spending any amount of time on solving problems no matter how much effort they take. That is why I am having difficulty in reaching a conclusion.\n\nI appreciate it if you throw in any advice :))",
