  "text": " I am currently majoring in biology with the hopes to go to medical school and becoming a pediatrician. Right now it is my second year of college and I am currently struggling with my classes a lot, especially chemistry, no matter what I do, how much I study, I cannot seem to be getting any of the material. So, i am thinking of changing my major to education, to become a science teacher, i do not know if its the right decision though, since well becoming a dr pays waay better than becoming a teacher. I dont know if im thinking of changing because of the stress i am under with my current classes or if its because what i really want to do. How do i know if its a good decision and not just an easy way out? I feel that if i change i would just be a failure and a quitter and i hate that. Please give me advice on your experience or anything, thank you.",

      "text": "I dont think changing your major just over chemistry is very realistic. I was once a bio major and decided to change because I hated chemistry, bio labs gave me anxiety attacks, and I saw no stability in the field I wanted to go into. Every major is going to have classes that are hard or that you struggle with. Although, I dont think people who get into the medical field for only money are fulfilled. Choose a major that you have interest in that will provide a stable future and you'll be fine.",
