      "text": "CSC FOR SURE. I was doing business then switched to CSC myself. Art / music / acting isn't really going to be a great future for you money wise unless you have great recognition and a bit of luck etc. Business degree doesn't really help with any of these either. My advice is do CSC major, grind through it, find a secure job / career, and use that money to work on your acting / arts / music. You can pay for additional classes etc and have more access to things with the money you get from your tech job. Eventually if you the opportunity arises you can quit the tech job and do your other job full time. If not it can still be on the side for you.",
