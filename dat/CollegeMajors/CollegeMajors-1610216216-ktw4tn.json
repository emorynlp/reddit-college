  "text": "The title pretty much says it all, I applied for the biology major not knowing that there was a health science major but I still have time to change it. So, I wanted to know if there were any suggestions on which major I should go for if I want to pursue nursing.",

      "text": "Isn\u2019t nursing already the major. All the schools I know just have you be a pre-nursing major and you take all the prerequisites needed. Usually this gets you the AS in allied health or biology or both. And then you apply to nursing programs whether that be the AS/AA in nursing, then transfer to a university to get the bachelors which is like only a semester or two more. \n\nThe other option is you get accepted right away to a university and just get your bachelors there. \n\nThe biology major and health science major is different as it is not for nursing. Unless the health science major is like the Allied health courses, otherwise, health science is like public health/ healthcare policy/admin type work. I\u2019m not sure what school you go to but I\u2019d ask a counselor to clarify this for you because you shouldn\u2019t be majoring in either of those for nursing. Let me know if you have more questions.\n\nUnless you\u2019re going to do an accelerated nursing program afterwards then that\u2019s an entirely a different story and you could just choose either major, preferably biology so you can also take the nursing prerequisites if needed, and then apply to accelerated nursing programs.",

              "text": "Prerequisites are just the classes you need to take in order to apply to nursing programs. For example, anatomy, physiology, chemistry, etc. it usually takes two years to complete. Some courses have a sequence to complete them. Like my school for example, I had to take a biology course first, then anatomy and medical chemistry in the second semester in order to take physiology the third semester. It just depends how your school handles it. And then you have to also take math at least up to calculus 1 or just intro to statistics. Again, it depends on the school. Also, some schools require you take a medical math course where you learn how to do all the conversions and stuff, but the schools around me teach that in the nursing programs so it wasn\u2019t needed yet.",
