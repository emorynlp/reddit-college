I really want to major in Aerospace, but i haven't really pushed myself in math and science in high school so i don't know what my limits are and if i'm smart enough to do that. \n\nI don't know should I just major in econ or business?",

              "text": "Honestly, employers don\u2019t care about your major. They just want to make sure you\u2019re capable of not being a dumbass /s. If you\u2019re hoping to make six figures out of college, then I\u2019d tell you to tone your expectations down. Other than that, a history degree is as useless as any other degree lol :). \n\nAs for majoring in Aerospace, you mentioned that you don\u2019t know your limits. I would focus on finding those limits, if they exist, and take a few math and science classes. You\u2019ll surprise yourself. Intelligence is malleable; just because you got a C in Algebra II doesn\u2019t make you bad at math. \n\nMake sure you\u2019re picking up marketable skills and network around. Engage with your professors. Apply yourself. A Computer Science Major can make a lot of money or very little, depending on their internships and networking.\n\nAlso, DONT LISTEN TO REDDITORS. That includes me. What the fuck do we know? Look up data. Go to the BLS and check out demand for difference occupations for the major you want. Listen to DATA, not ANECDOTES. There will probably be some Ivy League elitist who\u2019ll tell you that history or aerospace \u201cmay not be for you\u201d or that they are \u201cdead ends\u201d. Just don\u2019t listen. Bottom line, look for facts and data. If you look at my profile, you\u2019ll find it littered with attempts at validation by complete strangers. It\u2019s sad, really. Some people have decent advice, but you need to make sure the advice is truly applicable to your situation. \n\nLastly, can anyone tell me why it\u2019s bad to stay in college an extra year? Other than financial strains, I see nothing wrong with it.",
