  "text": "I'm not sure if this is entirely the right place to ask but...should I consider dual majoring? For the last few months I've been torn between a certain art major and a computer science major and I want to know what is the general consensus on dual majoring. Other than costs and heavier workload, what are the downsides? What are the benefits? Should one not discount the idea or avoid it like the plague?",

      "text": "I know a lot of people who did two majors, and most don\u2019t regret it. If you decide not to, a major in one and a minor in the other should be fine. If you love compsci, definitely major in it. If you\u2019re only choosing it because of parental pressure to do something practical, keep in mind that your major is usually less important that what you do outside of the classroom, like internships or digital design experience via your school newspaper website. I also know a couple of people who majored in art, and it worked out well for them because they also developed practical skills and experience outside of class.",

After college, I really want to get my foot into the game industry and I'm already learning programming, making my own games, trying to build up my portfolio, etc. before I get to college. But, still, it's hard to know if I should choose this art major or computer science, as I hear downsides and upsides for both. \n\nYou say that your dual majors and minor \"work for you just fine,\" but I also must ask, how heavy is your workload, exactly? Do you feel like it's a bit overwhelming at times or feel like it *could* be overwhelming for underprepared folk?",
