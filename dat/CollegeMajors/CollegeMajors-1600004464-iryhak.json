I would avoid medical billing at all cost b/c those jobs are being automated away like crazy. And I don\u2019t know much about criminal justice but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019d need to go to grad school for that.",

              "text": "Social sciences are just very popular in general and have almost no return on your investment in either terms of time spent attaining the degree or potential of paying careers. Most psych/cj majors don't become psychologists or lawyers, they end up working in a completely different field because their idealistic jobs requires a Master degree at a minimum, but usually a PhD and the simple Bacherlor's jobs have no career advancement so you will likely be eternally stuck as a lab tech. Should you go the PhD route you will have an okay salary (between 50-80k) but you will have a mountain of debt from all your years of study that essentially makes your salary null.",
