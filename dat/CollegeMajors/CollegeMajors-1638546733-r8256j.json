  "text": "I am an international high-school student (senior) applying to college abroad (USA, CANDA, EUROPE) in a few days. \n\nThe problem is that I don't know what I want ro major in.. \n\nNow I know this is common and fine, but I would like to have atleast a preference set.\n\nNow I have so many interests, like so many. If I had to categorise my passions and interests, I'd say its everything humanity has contemplated or produced. So it ranges from art to sports to fashion to music to science to math.... and so and so. \n\nBut I would like a job where I travel alot alot, and is interactive and not really sitting in the office. A job where I'm constantly moving and meeting new people and has to do with the future and is revolutionising the world we live in, like AI, or genetic engineering and so on. Money doesn't really concern me but it would obviously be nice to have some.\n\nAny suggestions? \n\nThank you.",

You will also have to take extra classes in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, whatever you end up wanting to work in. \n\nBecome a technician and work hands on and almost never in an office, you'll probably meet some people too. Doesn't usually require a degree, but it is hard work.\n\nWhen defining your interests you literally said \"everything humanity has contemplated or produced\" which doesn't help. See if your university has an exploratory degree program or declare a really broad major like business and take a ton of electives to figure out your interests. \n\nIs there anything that specifically interests you? If not, I'd start looking around for info about general topics. Go into Wikipedia's Chemistry or Physics or Biology or whatever else and find the subdisciplines where you can get a breakdown of what can be done with a degree in that field. For example: organic chem, inorganic chem, materials chem, biochem... Nuclear physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, biophysics... Zoology, microbiology, molecular and cellular biology...",
