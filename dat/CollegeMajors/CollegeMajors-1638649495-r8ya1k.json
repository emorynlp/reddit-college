      "text": "You might want to look into UX design. Most colleges don\u2019t have a UX design or informatics major, but a lot of people seem to move into that field from related fields, like graphic design. It pays very well and mostly relies on design skills, a little tech know how, people skills, and common sense.\n\nIf you like writing, look into UX writing or tech writing. An English or communications degree with some extra computer science coursework would help you get there. \n\nMarketing can pay very well once you have a lot of experience and/or get into management, especially if you work for a tech company. However, your first job or two will probably have mediocre or low pay (note: this is true for most fields).\n\nWhatever you do, if you\u2019re concerned about job prospects, try to do an internship before you graduate, even if it\u2019s just 10 hours per week of social media work at a local nonprofit. It really, really helps.",

The sad news is that just about anything that focuses on a lot of creativity is going to have garbage pay. If you like helping people, perhaps going into the medical profession could work well for you. Education is kinda like psychology light, but is much more likely to get you a job in the feild",
