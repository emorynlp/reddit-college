  "text": "I'll be in grade 12 in September, and I don't know what to major in. \nI would consider myself as a creative person yet also good with numbers. \n\nMy best subjects in school would be (so far) math, accounting, art, and general business. I'm good at science too but I wouldn't say I really enjoy it. \n\nI would like a decent paying career that's stable.\n\nI have considered business before, but my parents don't think my personality is suitable since I'm not super friendly or talkative.\n\nI wouldn't say I realllyyyyy like math, I do enjoy math classes, I understand it, but I can't imagine doing super advanced math.So far my brother is doing CS, the math looks so hard, plus I'm not the best at programming.\nParents always wanted me to be a doctor, but I dont really like science. \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Sorry for rambling, I'm just lost.",

      "text": "It's OK, im an incoming freshman, and im lost too.\n\nYou said you don't like science so that's off the table. Don't bother majoring in something you know you won't enjoy.\n\nYou said that you would consider business/accounting...but your parents don't think you would be a good fit. You don't have to be super friendly nor do you have to be talkative to succeed in that specific career. Friendly, yes. Talkative? Not necessarily - you need interpersonal skills. There are different branches of business you can do btw. And don't worry if you don't possess certain traits right now that would benefit your future career - that is what college is for. You grow and you develop these skills.\n\nYou say that you enjoy your math classes. It's OK if you can't imagine yourself doing advanced math and being successful at programming at this moment.\n\nIf you're really stuck maybe browse through YouTube and watch some career videos on general business/different business careers/accounting/CS/etc. I did that a lot and I'm kind of gearing towards the direction that I want.\n\nI know people say that you have time to think about your major, but it doesn't hurt to do some research.\n\nIt's OK, you'll be fine.",

              "text": "With a lot of majors you might have to pick between passion vs. pay. Most of the cool or interesting fields that people are passionate about are very competitive and don't pay well since so many people want to do them compared to the demand.\n\nEven if accounting doesn't sound very fun, it does give you the skills for a specific career that pays well. I have friends who majored in something they're passionate about and still ended up in boring jobs (and not well paid ones) just because that's what's out there.",
