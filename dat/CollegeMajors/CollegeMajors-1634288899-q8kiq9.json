Personally, I didn't study until I was 30, and I think it was a wise choice because I saved a ton of time and money and got a major in a field that is helpful to me and that I enjoy. Figuring out what you enjoy, what is needed in your area or in your target area, what is practical, and what you're good at is important before deciding on a career.\n\nI decided to study at an online university called USILACS and it was the right choice for me. If you want more information about it, I can make that available to you.",
