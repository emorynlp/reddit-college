Im planning to major in wildlife ecology/biology but I have read online that it is hard to find a job and it does not pay well. Is there any other job that pays well but has something to do with outdoors/wildlife? Example would be marketing for a company like The North Face.",

      "text": "If you wanna do marketing for green companies and ngos then major in marketing or communications. Basically any job that most other companies need done (design, engineering, programming, accounting, human resources etc) are jobs that you can probably find in the nonprofit sector. \n\nIf you want to have a more hands on role in an environmental career/working directly with nature or in the outdoors is a priority, consider botany, zoology, horticulture, landscape architecture, geography, geology, oceanography/marine science, forestry, etc.",

              "text": "I mean it really depends on what kind of job you are looking for and how important it is for your career to line up with your interests and values. Personally, I think your major should reflect the career you want more than the career you think will get you a job easily. There are tons of jobs out there that don\u2019t even require a 4 year degree so IMO like why put all that effort into something you don\u2019t even like. I wouldn\u2019t let a competitive market be the sole determinant of whether or not you decide to pursue a career, because not to be a blind optimist but I truly believe motivation, hard work, talent etc pays off in the end. But for example if you wanted to be a marine biologist but the job market and the amount of schooling and effort is an immediate turnoff then it\u2019s probably not a career worth pursuing. \n\nMarketing on the other hand has a lot of jobs but it\u2019s also very saturated, so I\u2019m not sure if it will be inherently easier to find a job with that major. I also wouldn\u2019t really recommend it if you prefer hands on work because it\u2019s really not a particularly hands on job. \n\nI listed quite a few majors and career paths that require different skills, different levels of education and have different levels of projected growth/job availability. I think it would be more helpful for you to identify what kind of tasks and activities you enjoy and what kind of subjects you like and see how you can connect that to environmentalism. For example you can be an educator at a zoo or a museum, a veterinarian at a wildlife reserve, a grant writer for a nonprofit, an architect who prioritizes sustainable designs, an agricultural worker who develops sustainable farming methods, a lawyer who specializes in environmental law, etc. the options are pretty limitless.",
