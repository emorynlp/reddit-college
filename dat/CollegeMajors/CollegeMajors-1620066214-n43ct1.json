  "text": "I am currently approaching the end of my AA and was wondering if I should major in psychology or business. I would want to do psychology however I'm not sure I'd be able to find a good-paying job as I would only want to go for my master's degree. For business, I'd probably go for my MBA in accounting or maybe financing.",

      "text": "I would like to share my personal story to help others. \nI majored in psychology and now I work with kids for minimum wage. I consider myself luckier then my piers since I minored in child development. I was able to find a job before graduating, but horrible pay. \n I regret my major with a passion. I don\u2019t recommend this major to anybody it\u2019s a waste of time. I\u2019ll have to go for a masters and I still won\u2019t make enough money. I had an idea I\u2019d become a psychologist and didn\u2019t care as much about money. The reality is I wasn\u2019t mature enough. Now I wasted 5 years of my life and feel depressed thinking about how much time I wasted. \n\nI was actually thinking of switching to business, but people/parents kept saying you have to like what you\u2019re studying. The reality is you have to struggle if you want to have a good major in college. My bf became a civil engineer and hated his major and thought of switching multiple times. But, he knew he had to struggle to have a high paying job. Now he\u2019s making a good living wage and has tremendous room to grow. He also loves his job! I hate mine and I enjoyed my major. \n\nGladly I\u2019m still young and I didn\u2019t get a masters or have student debt since I took the community college route. If you\u2019re thinking of becoming a mental health therapist, school psychology, or other field of psychology major in something else that\u2019s useful. Anyways, you only need the pre reqs to get admitted to a masters. But good luck! They\u2019re incredibly competitive. Psychology is common sense I learned 0 valuable skills which is why it\u2019s hard to obtain a job. You could try HR with psychology but you\u2019ll have to start from the absolute bottom. \n\nI picked this major because I enjoyed it. Sometimes what you enjoy is not the best option. I wish I forced myself to study hard and get a degree that will actually be rewarding and pay me well. My job isn\u2019t horrible, but the pay is and it\u2019ll always be horrible with Psychology. I\u2019m getting out before it\u2019s too late. I would only minor in psychology if I had the chance to redo it. \n\nI would highly recommend business, there\u2019s more room to grow and you\u2019ll always be able to neg\u00f3ciate your salary. Psychology is very fixed. California has high prices for items/gas and psychology jobs aren\u2019t increasing their salaries. So if you\u2019re trying to be in a fixed salary and no room to grow Psychology is perfect. I\u2019m now changing to accounting.",

      "text": "I don't know if I am the best person to answer this, but I'll try.\n\nI know it's hard to choose between two. (I'm also struggling with this myself between speech pathology and Computer Science) But I came to realize that ultimately, it depends on what career what you want to do with your life. Instead of thinking the major per se, think of the career and the type of lifestyle you want. Research careers like crazy! You might be surprised at what you find! I would also say look at Youtube videos on the day of our lives in terms of careers in these fields and even though it may be hard during this time with COVID-19 (I'm also planning to do this), by the end of the semester try to job shadow others near your area and be prepared to come in with questions. Make sure you show your appreciation and be thankful for it when one finally agrees. Some people will say no in the beginning. *Be open to try new things!*\n\nHowever, if you choose psychology, you do need a Master's degree and with some fields, a doctorate is also required. Without a Master's in Psychology, it's unfortunately deemed useless. If you want to do research rather than counseling in psychology, you would definitely need a doctorate or something related in terms of that.\n\nFor business (I'm currently majoring in this, but I am planning to change it), major in something more specific especially with the ones you mentioned with finance or accounting. It's more \"marketable\" that way and try to get your Masters in Finance or your CPA in Accounting.\n\nTry talking to your family members (sometimes this helps) or even a career counselor. In more extreme cases, try to take a gap year and work to save money for college while doing the things I mentioned above. (I would've done a gap year if my family allowed it and I don't see anything wrong with this.)\n\nAt this age, it's pretty normal to be confused or stuck between a few options or so. But know you are blessed to have the opportunity to choose! :) (Many people in this world do not believe me) Also realize that it's never too late to do change in your mind! Heck, if it's possible, do both in these fields or find a way to combine both! Regardless of what you choose, you need to make a good living **AND** it's important to like it for your mental health and sanity! If you have one without the other, it's usually not a good combination from what I have seen here on Reddit. (I have seen posts and comments where people were in high-paying careers but they were absolutely stressed and miserable and left their career field entirely.) Best of luck!",

Business is definitely a better and more versatile degree at the bachelor level, while Psychology requires grad school to find a job in the field. \n\nThink of an MBA as DLC in a video game, it\u2019s a good thing to have, but it\u2019s not exactly necessary unless you want to go into higher positions of corporate leadership.",
