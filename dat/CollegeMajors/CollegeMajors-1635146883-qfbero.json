              "text": "Well what postmaloneismediocre said for STEM and Business degrees but I'll give a general overview\n\nFor STEM degrees:\n\n(S)cience:\n\nDegree examples: Biology, Psychology, Biochemistry, Physics, Environmental Science\n\nExcept Physics, all the other science degrees are mainly for students going into medical school or plan on obtaining a Master's after. If you don't plan to go to medical school, or plan to get a Master's, best not to major, cause you won't make much and most jobs require at least a Master's if you're not going to go to Med school\n\n(T)echnology\n\nDegree examples: Computer Science, MIS/CIS, Information Technology, Cyber Security, Game Development\n\nTons of jobs, tons of demand. Good work life balance, able to find a job quickly, great pay. Hard, but rewarding. You should do internships, self-made projects to stand out to employers\n\n(E)ngineering\n\nDegree examples: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Civil Engineering\n\nThe best one from STEM. Hard as well, but rewarding. You can make A LOT right out of college, and you'll find tons of jobs. Great work life balance\n\n(M)ath\n\nDegree examples: Math, Statistics, Applied Math\n\nYou can get almost any job in the job market, cause employers will see you as very smart. You can make good money. I don't know too much, if you're interested, you can do more research.\n\nFor Business degrees:\n\nDegree examples: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Management\n\nMany jobs for all of them, some pay more than others, but Accounting is probably the best because it's flexible and pays well, whereas there are tons of jobs in the market.\n\nHere's a video rankings STEM degrees:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lDnLcPjOnEA\n\nHere's a video ranking Business degrees:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DrsAStEN7tY\n\nThis guy's channel is great for finding which majors are good, which are bad, and how to find what major you want\n\nIf you have more questions, don't be afraid to ask",
