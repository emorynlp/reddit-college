  "text": "Hi! I\u2019m(18/F) thinking to major in CS. I have done some research and found out that a CS major is heavy on math and science and I\u2019m not good at neither of those but I\u2019m willing to try my best. My question is will I be able to make it without wanting to dropout. I don\u2019t wanna waste my time. Also Please recommend me some other majors that make good many right out of college that only take four years. I\u2019m still looking but my top option is Computer science at the moment. I\u2019m starting college in august   .Thank you! \n(Sorry for the bad English)",

      "text": "You will want to drop out, to me that is just part of college. Don't fixate too much on what major you pick as there are many people that major in computer science and decide to not pursue it (same for literally every other major).\n\nPick something that challenges you and will keep you engaged.\n\nIf you are looking for an easy major, you are setting yourself up for failure since every degree is going to make you work.\n\nCollege is about staying efficient, keeping up on your tasks, staying organized, having fun, and jumping through random hoops.\n\nI graduated with a few people that weren't the best at math, so you can definitely do it. Don't be afraid to look into majors like business or computer information systems (sort of like a mix between business and computer science).",

      "text": "CS requires physics 2, Calculus 3, and many Statistics courses if you think you can handle the math required for that.\n\nIf you can only do basic math, but still want a lucrative major go into accounting.",
