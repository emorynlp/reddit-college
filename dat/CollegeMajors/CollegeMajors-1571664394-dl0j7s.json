  "text": "Hi, everyone. I'm currently majoring in Communications and triple minoring in German, Spanish, and Russian. I love philosophy, and I was actually planning on studying that until I realized that philosophy isn't a very employable degree...I can't stop thinking about studying it, though. For those who have experience studying philosophy (or just anyone willing to give me their insight), should I double major in Communications and Philosophy (and keep the triple minors)? Or, should I keep philosophy as just a hobby I come home to in the evenings after college?\n\nCheers!",

      "text": "All of those aren't very employable. \n\nSource: older brother who graduated with a B.S. in Communications, even with NFL connections.... is currently tryna join the Highway Patrol. Couldn't find a job in his field. \n\nDoubling/tripling down on degrees like these won't add up to suddenly make it employable, compared to other majors. I'd recommend sticking to one field, and finding as many connections/network w/ people as u can, so when u graduate u can find a job in that field.",
