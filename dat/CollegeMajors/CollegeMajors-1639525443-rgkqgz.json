  "text": "Hi, I'm a freshman in high school and I'm looking for some information about college course load. I know the topics I would like to learn as an undergraduate but I'm no sure how possible each path is. I, want to focus on mechanical engineering and physics as well as business and take some electives in electrical engineering and computer science. The two ways I see to cover these are to major in mechanical engineering and minor in physics and business or to double major in physics and mechanical engineering and minor in business. I am equally interested in mechanical engineering and physics but realize that I will most likely use more mechanical engineering skills than physics in my future career which is why I consider only minoring in physics to make finishing my undergraduate education in four years possible. For some context, I'm doubling up in math and science classes and I plan to keep doing this as well as later on taking AP and college level classes in math and physics. What my biggest question is, how feasible is each of these paths assuming I  go to a relatively prestigious college and know already what I want to study?",

      "text": "While taking more than one major and minor is possible, it is increasingly difficult as the topics of study diverge in relevance.\n\nBusiness and engineering have practically 0 overlap, you would be very hard pressed to finish the requirements for both in 4 years (even 5 years would be a stretch).\n\nFurthermore, you want to think about what you actually want to do after you graduate. While it is fine to take less relevant course work to explore what you are interested in, most employers are cautious about applicants who sacrifice potential for taking more classes in the relevant subject just to meet the requirements for an unrelated major or minor.\n\nTo add on to what others mentioned about AP courses, make sure to check the department's major requirements as well as the university's general requirements. Most engineering programs do not accept AP credits due to their national accreditation standards (only ones I know for sure are Aerospace and Civil, the ASCE for example specifically states AP credits cannot be used toward requirements for professional licensure).",

      "text": "Engineering is applied physics. If you want more Physics, minor in it, but your course load is going to be pretty high. You might even take longer or use up a few summers purely on classes depending on your university. Some universities don't allow credit working towards both your major and minor, so Physics 1 will only work towards your major and you'll have to figure out what high level physics courses you want to replace it with.\n\nWhy do you want to do business? To get into management or to start your own company? You can take electives/minor in business if you want, but a lot of management and starting your own company you can learn on the job and you'll need to have engineering work experience (not just your internships) in order to make those work out. \n\nWhy do you want to do EE and CS? You'll probably take a few basic courses in EE like circuits, but you can obviously add a bit more. Your course load will increase significantly since engineering classes take more time. As for CS, you'll take a few MATLAB classes for engineering, but unless your university has a Computational focus for ME then you'll also have to increase your course load. If your goal is Computer Engineering, just do EE or some places offer a more computer focused major.\n\nYour plan is viable, just don't overwhelm yourself. I'll give a bit of advice on classes. Take AP Lang or AP Lit (Check with your college, double dipping may not be worthwhile), AP Calc AB and AP Calc BC, AP Chem (typically have to take Gen Chem 1 and 2), AP Physics C (more difficult, but it usually gives the same credits as both AP Physics 1 and AP Physics 2 combined), AP Computer Science A.",

          "text": "Thanks so much for the advice. I don't plan on taking EE or CS as full on minors, but just as electives to add to my engineering abilities. As for the business minor, I would like to start a company but business skills also look impressive to employers. This was a really helpful comment and I took a lot from it, thank you.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, do you think it would be possible to double major in mechanical engineering and physics and minor in business and still graduate in four years? This would be assuming I had good study habits, have a bunch of college credits from high school, took summer classes, and was relatively gifted in both of these majors. Would I be able to keep a relatively normal schedule and get enough sleep?",

              "text": "It's possible, the main problem with dual majoring with engineering is that you generally have 4-5 classes every term and if you are doing an engineering degree, those classes are used almost exclusively on discipline specific engineering classes or interest specific engineering classes. For example, I could have dual majored in ChemE and Chem and graduated in 4 years without bringing in tons of credits, but I would have taken 3 interest specific classes, 2 in ChemE and 1 in Chem. As of my current plans, I will be taking some classes to help explore interests such as Astrobiology and bioelectrical nano sensors, which would not be possible if I was dual majoring.\n\nNow, specifically for ME + Physics, I'll use my university's major map to plot out the basics. You would have to take Physics 3, two Mathematical Methods in Physics courses, 2-3 Classical Physics, 2-3 Quantum Physics (I say 2-3 because you can pick which one you take the third class in), an Advanced Lab (Basically just experiments), Stat and Thermo Physics, A second Advanced Lab or a physics perspective Circuits class and finally an additional physics class you can choose. In my case, I am still taking core ChemE classes so that I can still apply to grad school in ChemE, Chem, Biochem, or BiochemE programs.\n\nThat is pretty barebones, but if you do it, you will graduate with MechE and Physics. Depending on how many credits you bring in, you're either going to have as many extra summers as you can fit in, no extra summers, or somewhere in between. I highly recommend not doing this because you will have a high workload for 4 years, very few breaks and if you don't bring in enough credits, you won't have any internships.\n\nYou must take Physics 1 to get to 2. 2 to get to 3. 3 and Math Methods 1 to get to Math Methods 2, Classical Physics and Quantum Physics. From Math Methods 2, Classical Physics 1 and Quantum Physics 1 to get to Classical Physics 2, Quantum Physics 2 and Advanced Lab 1. Then Classical Physics 3 or Quantum Physics 3, Stat and Thermo Physics and Advanced Lab 2 or Circuits (from the physics perspective). And finally, your last class of your choice can be taken at any time based on its prerequisites.\n\nThat alone takes 4 years, if you crunch it with summer classes it can still take 2 years. If you come in with Calc 1 and 2, Gen Physics 1 and 2, English 1 and Gen Chem 1 and 2, then you might get away with 4 years using your summers. There are 3 levels to Physics, General Physics, University Physics and Physics. Basically, least to highest difficulty. Engineering takes University, Physics major takes Physics. Some universities are strict about what they will accept, but some will take a higher-level class in place of a lower-level class. Honestly, the main problem with it is just how much each class has to build off of each other. A secondary consideration is that a lot of what you learn will overlap so the classes may be repetitive or bore you which could cause you to lose interest and/or have your grade slip. For example, in engineering classes certain factors are ignored while in physics they may be considered, and vice versa.\n\nTo sum it all up: I didn't mention getting a business minor because there are too many required classes. Stick with ME major with a double minor in Physics and Business unless you graduate from high school with an associate's degree (my state has a few schools that allow that, though they are agricultural associates).",
