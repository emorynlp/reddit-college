  "text": "So most people that go to Med School major in Biology, but why is that? I love Math, but I\u2019ve heard that majoring in bio will help me to get the knowledge I need for the MCAT? Is that true? Will I be affected if I major in Math?",

      "text": "You\u2019ll just have to work a LOT harder than biology majors cause you\u2019ll have all the Pre-Med required courses to apply to med school (some are notoriously difficult) ALONG with all your advanced mathematics classes for your math degree. However if you truly LOVE math, I would do a math major, because not only will you stand out to medical admissions officials, they will likely realize that you have developed certain analytical skills and other skills within your math degree that biology and chemistry majors simply don\u2019t have. Additionally, if the medical route doesn\u2019t work out, you\u2019ll have MANY more career options than someone who majored in biology.",

      "text": "You\u2019ll stand out much more than someone who majored in biology. But you have to take more classes outside your major than someone who majors in biology. Most people do biology because it gets the pre reqs and the degree done for med school all in one. As opposed to math where there would be your major classes and whatever you need to take for pre reqs for the schools you wish to get into",

              "text": "This is correct. Also mathematics is in my opinion the hardest major you can take. For most premeds where GPA is so critical, the combination of crushingly difficult coursework and added risk is too much for most people. Note that as another commenter said, majoring in something other than biology or premed will certainly cause you to stand out. Just try to assess if it's worth it, which I know can be hard, especially because you don't even generally get to take a real math class until the end of your junior year.",
