  "text": "I am currently a junior getting a BA in strategic communications with a minor in psychology and a minor in entrepreneurship, graduation in 2023. I have been an exploratory major until this year because I have struggled to commit to a major. I still  nervous but it\u2019s time I get a degree finished. I just want to be successful and make good money. I want to get into stocks and real estate just haven\u2019t jumped into it yet. I dont want to work a 9-5 I want to work hard now and retire early. Has anyone had experiences with this major? What are my options? Thanks",
