  "text": "I am in my sophomore year and I still don't what is it that I want to do with my life. Everytime I ask a family member or a teacher they always tell me to \"follow your passion\". Sadly, the only two things that I'm genuinely passionate about are politics and physics. I know that politics doesn't make good money so my second choice would be physics. I'm the top student in my class when it comes to physics. I heard that to make good money out of physics you need a PhD which I don't think I want to do. Any advice?",
