  "text": "I am definitely going to do the pre-health track because community health and epidemiology have always interested me for a long time. However, I am having trouble deciding my major. \n\nIn high school, my strongest subject in terms of grades was English, but I am not interested in major related to English. I took a lot of courses in social sciences and history because I was good at them, but not sure about majoring in social sciences or history. I did well in mathematics, especially pre-calculus and regular calculus, but I tried to avoid taking more advanced classes in math. I was good at biology but not in chemistry. \n\nIf you have any advice, suggestions, or what I need to think more about, it would be very appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "There\u2019s a few different health tracks depending on colleges. Anything like health education (which could be used for school, businesses, public health, etc) would be a BS. That would require a few more math classes and science (which could be bio). There are specialized areas in health where you could do a BA and do less math. This requires foreign language credit, which could be great for any health career. \n\nYou could go into communications and health, counseling, any education, public health, Human Resources, and a few other BA fields where health knowledge is applicable. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be scared of the math if you want a  a BS in biology, nutrition, or health education, etc. There are so many online resources for math, and you can work with a tutor. Think of it like a language to practice a bit daily. \n\nGood luck",

          "text": "Thank you so much for all of your good points that you made! Thinking more about my high school experience, I am afraid of chemistry more than math. I feel like I\u2019ve never got a grip and confidence in chemistry (I took AP chemistry in addition to regular chemistry.) but math felt more manageable for me. My opinion now might be different if I have taken AP Calc BC.\n\nI will explore more about my major options. Nutrition sounds good to me from what you mentioned. When I did a dual-enrollment course in epidemiology, I was really passionate and interested in a group research project I did on obesity.",

      "text": "doesn't matter what your major is if you're going to do med school. The most important thing is to get good grades and ace the MCAT. So in that case, I would probably recommend majoring in whatever you think would be the least stressful for you and get you the highest grades. Just curious: why are you not interested in social sciences or English if you did well in them in HS?",
