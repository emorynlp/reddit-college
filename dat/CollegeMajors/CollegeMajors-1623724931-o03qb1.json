      "text": "Here\u2019s the deal. Cs has a higher chance of paying more. If your going to a top 5 Aerospace engineering school you have a really good chance for getting a good job. Same applies for cs but closer to t20. We\u2019ll always need both jobs but there are more and more planes being made so AE engineers are needed. It also depends on what exactly you like about AE and AE is much harder. What school are you attending?",

              "text": "I would say both of its programs are equal. It will be easier to get a job and internship in cs because it\u2019s more based on your skill so if you are good at coding you\u2019ll get a job compared to AE where it\u2019s easier only if you go to a top school. Aslong as you get 1-2 internships you\u2019ll be fine with easier. AE is known as one of the hardest engineer majors so keep that in mind. Maybe do a bit more research. My opinion, is that Cs is the best degree you can get right now and can get for while. Also choose a minor of finance or accounting( it will help a lot getting higher up rolls)",
