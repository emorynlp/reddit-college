If you are talking about Chemical Engineering, it's about 10% Chemistry and the rest is Physics, your job is to turn raw materials into useful materials. (source - me, grad student friends, various subreddits and professors)\n\n-will take calc, differential equations, linear algebra, physics 1,2, maybe 3, gen chem and maybe organic chem, the rest is branch specific classes\n\n\nChemistry and Biology\n-Hard sciences, going to need grad school if you don't want to be a lab tech. That being said, people have made it up to director positions with a BS in Chem/Bio, though that was with 20 years experience when Bachelor's degrees weren't the norm. (source - me, various subreddits and professors)\n\n-Chemistry will take calc, physics 1,2, maybe 3, gen chem and organic chem, physical chem, inorganic chem, analytical chem, along with a few other chem electives, maybe bio 1 and 2 if you go for biochem\n\n-Biology - will take calc 1, stats, gen chem, might take organic chem, might take physics\n\n\nNursing and Pediatrics\n-Work in healthcare handling patients, can become a psychiatrist (source - my psychiatrist is a nursing PhD)\n\n-might take calc, probably will take human anatomy, will take very focused classes",
