  "title:": "Should I follow my passion?",
  "text": "I am at the point where I just NEED to pick a college major, even though college is a far time away. My parents keep pressuring me to pick medicine (I don't want to), computer or mechanical engineering(I DON'T WANT TO) or economics (I won't even say anything). \n\nI want to pursue physics, possibly teach at a university level. I am from India so the phrase \"career in research\" is simply not understood here. \n\nI would have had no problem with engineering, it seems absolutely perfect, but I don't want a monotonous desk job. I'm not saying I don't want a desk job, I just don't want a job which feels like living the same day again and again and again and again. I want something to work towards, and I think teaching and research would work great with that. I love physics, I find it simply fantastic and would be willing to face endless failure if I just get to pursue it. (both cosmology and particle physics seem amazing, but again, that's a smaller problem) \n\nOnce again, the only problem is that my parents just don't understand. \nThey want me to have a job with absolute financial stability and security. They want me to have a boring life, get married and have children. ;-; yeah, I don't want any part of that. \n\nIts not that I have a shortage of hobbies- I play the piano, and I write short stories but I do not want those to grow into careers. Honestly, it seems stupid. I can't write well enough to earn and I don't want to play an instrument for a living. \n\nI don't know if I will ever get a stable job, I don't know if I will ever achieve anything, all I know is that I want exhiliration and I know that research in physics would give me that. \n\nEven if I decide this, I have no way of actually convincing my parents if I don't know if I can make it through. \n\n\nHence, I guess my concluding question is:\n\nShould I just settle for a job with financial stability which I will most probably hate, or, should I take a risk even though I might be homeless at some point? \n\n\n\nSorry for wasting your time with my blabbering and thank you!",

      "text": "you sound spoiled. here is reality:\n\n1. if you choose your passion, graduate, after 10+ years working low wage jobs or unemployment you will go back to school for marketable degree. eating canned food or $1 ramen food everyday is not fun\n2. if you choose high paying profession right off the bad, you will find job which pays you tons of money, but you hate it.\n\nwhatever choice you make, you gonna be miserable with your mentality. give you your dream job, you will be broke and hate it because it does not pay enough (cant go on vacation, buy yourself stuff). give you high paying job, you will hate it because you will  have to actually work.",

          "text": "thank you \n\nFirstly, I can say with certainty that my parents aren't particularly involved in my life and I don't ask what for what I \"want\", only what I \"need\", but if you'd like to continue thinking that I'm spoiled, there's nothing I can do about it\n\nSecondly, if I were to follow my passion, I can guarantee you that I will create options in the IT and Engineering industries because of the financial concerns. \n\nEven if I were to end up with no money, I seriously don't think I will ever hate my dream job just because it doesn't pay well. My parents aren't 'wealthy' and I know I can make do with little money because I've never liked travelling or shopping or living in gigantic houses(I never have, but they don't look pleasant). \n\nAgain, I thank you for your opinion on the matter\nIt is valued.",

      "text": "I say follow your passion. A degree in physics is useful in other disciplines as well in case you regret it. There are people with degrees in physics who work in finance, technology, etc.\r  \n\r  \nBut you also have to take other things into account. There's a Jeff Bezos story at Princeton. Jeff Bezos was studying physics because he wanted to be a theoretical physicist, and one day he spent several hours in a series of exercises that he could not solve and then he asked a classmate for help, and this classmate solved it in a couple of minutes. There he realized that he would not be a great physicist and that \"in the rest of the jobs, you will contribute if you are part of the 90%, while in theoretical physics you will not do much if you are not one of the best 50 in the world\" after that changed to Engineering and Computer Science.",
