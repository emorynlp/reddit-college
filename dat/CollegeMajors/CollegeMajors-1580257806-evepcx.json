      "text": "I would recommend taking some career inventory tests. These type of tests give you insight into possible careers for you. \n\nI would suggest that based on your interests you could teach a foreign language at schools or you could even teach English as a second language. I know someone who did the ESL option and traveled to China to teach kids how to speak English. My friend said it was a very enlightening and wonderful experience.\n\nAnyways the best advice I have is talking with your guidance counselor who is usually in charge of career exploration or taking some online free assessments.",
