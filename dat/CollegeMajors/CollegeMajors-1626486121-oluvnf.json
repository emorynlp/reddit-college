              "text": "Its a sealed system. The reason for an oil change is largely due to the oil breaking down from heat and contaminants due to the combustion cycle. They still need some sort of a system to turn gears to turn axles,which I would call a motor. They do have way fewer moving parts, but there is definitely still a need for mechanical knowledge, its just different.",

I didnt say it would be good for op, as it will definitely require more math. But also, if we are converting  vehicles to all be electric, we will ideally have them have as long of a lifespan as gas vehicles, therefore maintenance or repair will eventually be needed, not including all of the systems and moving parts that aren't just part of the drivetrain.",
