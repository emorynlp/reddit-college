  "text": "For a long time I\u2019ve been very confused about my interests and talents and what I\u2019d like to study because nothing seems appealing to me. Recently though, I\u2019ve realised that I\u2019m really into economic growth within countries and what determines whether a country is rich or poor. I also really like how different cultures play a part in shaping these countries and their economic wealth. I realised this after discovering the book \u201cwhy nations fail\u201d, if anyone\u2019s heard of it. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something I\u2019d like to look further into but I\u2019m shocked to discover something even slightly resembling an interest. Note that I\u2019ve always been quite invested in writing as well, it is something I find myself to be pretty good at, too. \n\nNow my question is, what kind field is this exactly? Say, if I\u2019d like to study something where these issues are going to be discussed. The answer might be obvious but I can\u2019t imagine that it\u2019s just simple economics. \n\nThanks in advance",
