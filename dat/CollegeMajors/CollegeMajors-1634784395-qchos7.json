  "text": "I\u2019m a senior in highschool and next semester I\u2019ll be a sophomore in college. I\u2019m an elementary ed pre major but I was considering double majoring in sped and elm ed. Since I\u2019m already ahead in credit hours I could possible spend more time in school to double major, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth it. For those of you who have double majored would you recommend it? Was it significantly harder than the work load ur peers who weren\u2019t double majoring had? And lastly if any of u are edu majors, do you think a double major is worth it if I just plan on teaching primary grades?",

      "text": "Always double major.\n\nObviously if you're drowning, don't, but generally you should be able to choose majors that compliment each other. In your case, SPED and Elementary do work together, and since you're focusing on primary grades there's not a need to compliment it with a subject to teach.",
