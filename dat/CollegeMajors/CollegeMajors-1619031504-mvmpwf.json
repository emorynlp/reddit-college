  "text": "I know I know, entrepreneurs don't need degrees! I've been in school for 9 years. I've studied Acting, Filmmaking, and Multimedia. I work as a professional web designer and video producer/editor. But I'm building something else. A party card game company that I want to EXPLODE. (Shameless plug: check out *Fib Games*!)\n\nI've got a bajillion college credits (2 associates and 2 certificates) and no bachelors, so I'm grabbing a quick business degree from my state college to help me prep for launching my game. This is my first foray into e-commerce and I have all of the social skills and multimedia skills to launch the business, I am needing to bone up on marketing, audience building, and proper targeting.\n\nAdditionally I am using college to grassroots an audience for my game, and I am the president of the entrepreneurship club, booking great guest speakers and learning valuable info.\n\nI am at a point where I need to commit to either the marketing major or the management and leadership major (or some other business major). I am inclined to go with Marketing since that will give me useful skills that I lack, whereas the Management degree seemed to be focused on social skills which I have in abundance.\n\nPlease share your feedback. My plan is to launch a Kickstarter right after graduating, and I don't want to pay some marketer up the nose to build funnels, target audiences, and run ads. At the same time, I want longevity and to run a successful company.",
