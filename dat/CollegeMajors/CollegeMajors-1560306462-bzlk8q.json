  "text": "So I'm currently training to be a manager at a pizza place. I'm 32 and wasted my 20s being a useless alcoholic. Kind of starting my life over at this point. Managing a pizza place could be alrightbut I think the pay is around 45,000 and I'm just not sure its worth it for all the work. \n\nI'm at a point where if I want to go to school and make a better life for myself I need to do it now. I thought being a social worker would be a good fit but from what I hear it can be a real nightmare. My mother is a nurse and said it's more stress than it's worth. She suggested X-ray tech for me and that does sound like something I could enjoy.  \n\nId absolutely love to try my hand at zoology but I know only a few schools specialize in that degree. I've also thought maybe HR management could be a good fit. There are just so many choices and I don't know where to begin",

      "text": "Just avoid any non-STEM, non-accounting or non-tech degrees and you should be fine. Going for any other major usually won't land you a job right out of college (nvm a good paying job at that). For Zoology, I highly recommend you pursue it, but MAKE SURE you get experience/internships while in college. Get involved and make connections, that'll really help out in the long run. Higher paying Zoology positions sometimes require Masters/PhD degrees so be open for more education in the future.",

      "text": "Any respected major could get you a job in business or something decent. Respected majors I'd say are any hard science, economics or finance if you like business, comp sci or engineering if those are your things. Other than those and a few others, best to have a specific job in mind as they're often more specific. \n\nYou could call up some companies you'd be potentially interested in working in and ask what they'd need from you to get hired. That's always a decent route. For example if you think you might like zoology, find some jobs in that field and ask if a zoology degree would be enough to get you a job. If so it could be worth it to go get that degree.",

Doing something because of \"love / passion\" for it is non-sense and its only for people with money already. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeems like you want something that's going to pay well if its really stressful and if its too stressful and not enough pay its not worth it either. Figure that out first imo. Then you'll narrow your search. Just start school and you'll find things and people to help you find a career path. If you're not satisfied with 45k/year then I really think you should consider the academic route. GL",

Also recommend community college it doesn\u2019t hurt your Pocket as much to try new things there especially if you are as unsure about your major.",

If it\u2019s not you then cool, After two semesters I\u2019m heading into the army it\u2019s a big decision but those are necessary to keep moving forward.  Who knows maybe the Pizza job could go well for you and then once you get in a chill position you can start taking maybe one or two classes to wet your feet. Best of luck Lad!",
