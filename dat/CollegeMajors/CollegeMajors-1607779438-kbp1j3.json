  "text": "Hello reddit! When I first entered college back in 2016, I was a polisci & race and ethnic studies double major with a minor in women's studies. For medical reasons, I had to leave school. Right now, im getting a paralegal certificate at my local community college and should be graduating next December. \n\nI do plan on going back to school to finish undergrad, but now want to add a psychology major. Although Twitter shouldnt influence me that much, I saw a tweet saying that polisci is a waste of time bc it's so yt but the reason I wanted to go into it was to help marginalized communities. Also, I've considered going to law school for immigration. Therefore, it made sense to take that route. \n\nCan a polisci major, current or former, help me out here? What was your experience? Is the degree worth it?\n\nThis might be for another post or subreddit but I think it is worth mentioning that when I go back to college I'll probably be 25+ so I probably won't receive much financial aid. Something to consider I guess. \n\nTLDR; as a BIPOC whose intent is to help marginalized communities, is polisci as a major the way to go? Alternative suggestions? Thoughts on my other intended future major/minors  (Race&Ethnicity , psychology, Spanish, women studies)? Note: will be returning to college after the traditional age though (25ish)",

      "text": "There are ways to help marginalized communities no matter what you major in or if you don't get a degree at all: you can do volunteer work, donate, organize protests, start a union in your workplace, engage in various kinds of activism. \n\nIf you want to go to law school, a political science major is a very common choice and certainly relevant to law school. But bear in mind that nonprofit/activist-type jobs are hard to get, and nonprofits (unlike corporations or law firms) don't have the budget to do much recruiting, so many law students sort of fall into corporate jobs without really intending to, because that's who came to campus to recruit and that's who's hiring. Also, law school is very expensive and many students graduate with a lot of debt, which means that many students start law school intending to work for the ACLU or similar, but then they can't afford to work there. Many of them think, \"I'll take a Big Law job for now, just until I pay off my loans,\" but as the years go by they become accustomed to the money and maybe they get a mortgage or have kids they want to create college funds for, and it becomes harder and harder for them to leave their corporate job and take a giant pay cut. I'm not saying nobody does it, or that it's impossible -- *somebody* works for the ACLU and RAICES and the Transgender Law Center -- but be aware that many, many people go to law school with the intent to get progressive activist jobs, and many of those people end up not in those jobs.\n\nSince you are part of a marginalized community yourself, try thinking about what you need, or what you needed growing up, and what your family members and neighbors and other community members need. For example, maybe you'd want to go into a healthcare profession because there's a lot of medical racism that affects BIPOC patients. I know a former foster kid who chose to become a social worker because he grew up with social workers his whole life and he wanted to be a positive force in other kids' lives. There's also a lot of racism in the educational system -- maybe you could become the kind of teacher you needed when you were a kid. If you major in Spanish, you could become an interpreter helping immigrants navigate the health care or legal systems (many of the interpreter jobs are in those systems). \n\nI'm not a financial aid expert, but where I went to school, being 25+ means you are automatically considered financially independent from your parents, which potentially can mean *more* financial aid.",
