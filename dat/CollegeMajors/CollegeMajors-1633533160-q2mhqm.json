  "text": "My thoughts so far:\n\n* Be on the track to medical school to become an eye surgeon\n* Limb regeneration might require anatomy and physiology classes; perhaps study regeneration biology to understand how other animals do it\n* Maybe philosophy class to learn to be a better writer and thinker \n* Classes in computer science so I can work with smart technologies \n\nAdditional info: \n\n* I'm mainly interested in blindness from firearms and cataracts. \n* I want to advance both fields of limb regeneration/stem cells and blindness.",

It\u2019ll give you a good idea of the diversity one could have and what background is required. Based on a simple Google search, I found a researcher with a PhD in molecular biology, and her undergrad degrees were biology and philosophy.",

Maybe try out some classes in the things you listed and see what you vibe with the most, then develop expertise in that thing and apply it to helping the blind.\n\nYou could even, e.g., go into law or government or political science and influence people\u2019s lives for the better by improving disability law. Endless possibilities.",

              "text": "As for your first question, I wouldn't worry about PhD programs yet. BiomedE is a tougher premed major than neuroscience, although easier than EE due to prereq overlaps.\n\nI would suggest you asl the biomedical engineering department for GPA distributions if they have them. Engineering suffers grade deflation compared to the sciences, especially the life sciences. Adcoms at MD programs don't give you credit for taking a harder program, either.\n\nThat being said, MD/PhD programs are typically more aware and understanding, provided you have the research experience to be a competitive PhD applicant.\n\nLastly, you don't need an MD to work on neural engineering/computational neuroscience.\n\nBecause your goals are broader than just an MD/PhD program, I would recommend you go for either an electrical engineering major for lower-level more concrete stuff or neuroscience for higher level more abstract stuff *if* you're confident in going for a PhD (which it seems you are given your goals). I'm not suggesting biomedE since most bachelor's degrees can't (nor shouldnt) get to the level of specificty in neural engineering/science. CS and/or math is also a welcome background for any researcher, and more industry-friendly at the bachelor's level than neuroscience or biomedE.\n\nIf you want to appoach this from a biological standpoin (growing neural tissue), that would be something else entirely",
