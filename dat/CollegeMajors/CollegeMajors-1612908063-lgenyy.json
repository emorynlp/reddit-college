  "text": "Hey y\u2019all, not entirely sure if this is exactly the correct place to post this but it was the closest I could think of to fit my situation. I am currently at a bit of a crossroads. I am 25 with no college credit as of yet and am hoping to start in the Fall, however, I am not entirely sure if I want to major in Law and eventually go through Law School aiming to be a Public Defender or if I want to double major in Journalism and English with the goal of becoming an Investigative Journalist. The biggest thing for me in making this decision is which career would truly assist the people around me. I\u2019ve always had a strong sense of justice and more than anything I want to help people. If any of you have experience or knowledge in regards to either career path and the difference that you can directly make OR know of a place better suited for this question it would be very much appreciated!",

I think something like justice law, or maybe even political science, would fit what you\u2019re looking for. Even if you do become a journalist, if you want that to be your niche, studying it to really understand it will be valuable",

      "text": "I wouldn't recommend majoring in law as an undergrad. You can major in literally anything and get into law school if you have a good GPA and high LSAT score. Law seems like a limiting degree if you want to do something else after undergrad. As for whether you should be a lawyer or investigative journalist, I have heard some mixed things about each field. Law is getting saturated nowadays, law school is hella expensive and the pay is often mediocre unless you go to a top law school and get a job at a big firm. However, the path for being a public defender might be a bit different, and you might be able to cut down costs by going to a cheaper law school/on a scholarship, and the prestige of where you go probably doesn't matter as much if you want to be a public defender. Don't quote me on this at all though... ask in the law school subreddit or something.\n\nI was briefly an English major as an undergrad, and I worked at my school's newspaper, so I interacted with some people who wanted to go into journalism. A lot of these guys grinded super hard and put in a ton of effort into getting internships and experience. One guy I know actually failed a notoriously easy class at my school because he was putting in like 40 hours a week into his extracurriculars... I looked him up and he works at NPR though, so he must have been doing something right, lol. So it is a very competitive field, from my understanding, and the pay isn't that great, so just keep that in mind.\n\nI would second what the other person said, in terms of possible jobs. Social work, nursing, teaching, might be good options. Also psychology, although there are a lot of psych majors so it might be competitive.",

          "text": "Thanks for the info! As a former extreme procrastinator working hard to change his ways; I really like your name lol. I definitely have a lot of research to do in regards to law school/ PD work so I appreciate the warnings. That's pretty incredible though! I had known journalism was a highly competitive field, as well as not the most financially rewarding work but it's always nice to get a little perspective into just how competitive haha. As much as salary isn't my number one concern with whatever career path I choose, it is absolutely something I need to keep in consideration, especially after I accrue all that sweet student loan debt. As far as the other jobs you listed- I'll keep my options open for the time being. I still have a good deal of time to mull this all over but I suppose I'd rather continue to overthink now than procrastinate and have to panic later on.",

      "text": "I think it is a bad idea to enter undergrad with the exclusive purpose of going to law school. You don't know whether that will be an option for you yet - it really depends how you do in your classes. But also, if you major in law, you will be restricting your career options in case the legal career doesn't work out. You can study journalism or english (english is a better bet) and be just as prepared for law school. For this reason, I think majoring in Law is pretty much pointless.\n\n\nAlso, honestly, I don't think either are a great idea if your goal is to help people. As a public defender, you will be so overloaded that you pretty much inevitably will give a shitty defense to the people you represent. (It's not your fault, it's just how the system is organized, unfortunately.) Plus public defender salary + law school debt will make you financially miserable. The chance of getting a job as an investigative journalist out of college is very low, and even if you do get the job, your impact factor will honestly probably be very low. \n\n\nIf you want to maximize your impact factor, I would look at other options. Nursing, social work (although you will *definitely* be poor if you choose this path), clinical psychology, medicine, pharmaceutical research, are all relatively high-impact jobs.",

As far as the high-impact career paths you mentioned- I will definitely give nursing some more thought. There was a long period of time where I did want to pursue psychology but from what research I have done I had heard that it was a very competitive job market, similar to journalism?",
