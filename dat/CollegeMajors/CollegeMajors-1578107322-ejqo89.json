  "text": "What do you guys think is the better foreign language minor? Any advice on how to narrow down a major choice?\n\nThis is some background: So I have always loved learning languages, I grew up in a household that spoke Spanish, Portuguese, and English. I was fortunate enough to have been taught it and I am fluent in both. In high school, I took French and I liked learning a different language a lot because it came easy to me. When I got to college, I decided to keep taking french classes and said I was going to minor in it. I'm currently rethinking my major and am definitely going to change it because I hate it (won't mention that now because that's a whole other story) but I was wondering what the people of Reddit think about continuing my minor in French, I am currently taking French 3000 level courses and I was going to get a translation certificate as a part of my minor. Since I am rethinking everything, I wonder if it is a better idea to take my Spanish and Portuguese placement test scores, which I placed out of the 3000 level courses and just get a translation certificate in both or just Spanish, or if I should continue with french. I love both Spanish and French and wouldn't mind studying either of them, I honestly just don't know which one to pick. Does this even matter? Is it foolish to have a language minor when i could just focus in on a major? I've always loved learning languages and I want to learn even more but I can't major in languages. They just come so naturally to me, both learning and teaching them. If you're wondering what major im thinking about it, im very interested in most subjects so I really don't know what to choose. It was international studies because of my background and how I wanted to work in a field that has to do with immigration policy and what not but I hate international studies as a major, it is too broad and the concentrations are broad too. Nothing seems boring to me, except majoring in chemistry or history or business. I like physics, engineering(although probably not smart enough), teaching, graphic design, biology, economics, English, psychology, geography, hell even archaeology and geography. I like textiles a lot too but the program at my school is shit. I don't know what I don't want to do, major wise. I am only a sophomore and have taken as much gen eds as possibly and only took 3 international studies classes that made me realize i don't what to major in that, I liked the classes but felt like everything I learned, i could learn on my own time by reading articles and intl studies books. All I know is im really good at learning languages and chose one for my minor because i can't just major in languages. My two questions are any advice on a major or how to choose one? and specifically what do you think about the language minors?",

      "text": "I can't fully speak for the language minors since I don't really have experience taking other languages. What I can say, is choose which language has always been your favorite. It sounds like you thought French was, but it turns out it wasn't. I would also suggest choosing a language you are already good at, just to make the classes run smoother. You could also double minor, but this might not be an easy thing to do if your major is too time consuming. \n\nAs for picking a major, I know the struggle of choosing between two majors. I am currently in a community college getting my generals done to transfer to a four-year university. Last semester, I became torn between a zoology degree or an English education degree. I wanted to work with animals, but I always loved English as a subject. I've kinda decided more towards the English major. Why? I read some of the classes that are required for the major and they sound way more interesting than Zoology classes do. I would suggest this for you too. Look on your university's website and see if they list the course requirements for a major you're interested in or curious about. If the classes sound interesting to you, then you might have a winner. If there are multiple majors that you find interesting, break down what you're best at. You don't want to struggle keeping up with course content. If you aren't too good at a subject and it is required for many classes, then you shouldn't choose that major. If your college's website does not list classes, you can try talking with your academic advisor and see what advice they can give you about major requirements.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is choosing a major can only be done by taking some time to reflect and self-assess. That is the best way you can choose a major. There are some online quizzes you can take about what you should major in, but these resources should only be used as a secondary source. The best source is yourself. \nHope this helps!",
