  "text": "Basically I live tech, Coding, Math, Business, personally finance, investing, real estate and other things that are business oriented. \n\nShould I do a double major and then can figure out what I want to do later. Then I can  just finish the double major  if I want to and I can work in either industry or even tech sales.",

      "text": "Another poster recommended CS/Econ, which I actually think is a good idea. The reason is that I think a lot of schools will have finance in the business school, whereas computer science will be in the engineering and/or liberal arts school, and IDK how easy it is to double major in subjects from 2 separate schools. A lot of Econ majors go into finance anyway, and finance jobs are much more about who you know and how prestigious your school is than your exact major. So I think CS+econ would be the easiest, plus Econ is often math heavy so some of the math classes you take for the CS degree (calculus, probability, and linear algebra) will probably also satisfy requirements for your Econ degree. I think that combination would give you a ton of options in terms of career paths.",

Once you get past the math that cs majors and engineers are required to take, it becomes a lot more theoretical, with less real life applications. You will rarely use most of an upper level math degree.\nBy all means, if you\u2019re interested, study math, but don\u2019t do it for career purposes only. It\u2019s not going to get you any jobs that a cs major by itself wouldn\u2019t get, and u won\u2019t use it in daily life.",
