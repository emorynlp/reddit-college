Thanks!",

I care a lot about environmental justice, fair labor practices, and human/animal welfare in general. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of maybe transferring to a school that offers a communications degree. I enjoy such a broad range of topics I\u2019ve always struggled to narrow it down.",

You can also get a wide range of jobs throuhg it.\n* Environmental Studies: Basically a bio/humanities/policy degree all combined into one, with much less fieldwork and a lot of emphasis on ethics and policy (at least at my school)\n* Political Science: You could go into environmental or welfare policy based on your interests.",
