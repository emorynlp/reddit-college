      "text": "A BS would focus on harder math and sciences courses. A BA would focus on less rigorous math and science courses but would likely make you take a foreign language sequence. \nIn the science world, a BS degree is more respected.  However, if you really want a microbiology degree and think that foreign language classes would be easier to complete, the BA might be a better idea. \n\nApplying to medical school is less about what major you take, and more about GPA and that you complete all the necessary prerequisites.\n\nBest of luck!",

              "text": "For computer science and computer engineering? It should be, yes. A BS in computer science and/or engineering would prepare you for coding and more of a technical use, while a BA in computer science and/or engineering might prepare you for more of a creative direction. If you pursued a BA over a BS you would probably still have to take the math and science classes, but some classes might be replaced with electives and foreign languages. \n\nOf course, take this information with a grain of salt because these are two degrees that I am mildly familiar with. The best way to find this answer would be to research the degree requirements for the school you are interested in/are attending.  :)",
