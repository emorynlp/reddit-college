  "text": "I am so in love with anthro, I cannot conceive of a career without it. However, I know there isnt a lot of demand for anthro majors.\n\nI think I could, and should, double major or minor in another field to broaden my prospects.\n\nI have thought of marketing, foreign language, and international business. Also climate change effects on societies.\n\nDo you guys have any ideas?\n\nThanks!",

Might as well major in something in demand like the STEM field or some other field that won't leave you with no job and tons of debt. TBH if money ain't an issue or you get free tuition or w.e then none of the above matters.",

I\u2019m taking an anthro course for a gen ed requirement and the professor was talking about an anthro student who was really interested in studying different sports subcultures, now she has a job in sports journalism. So while it\u2019s good to be realistic about job prospects don\u2019t be afraid to go with what really interests you.",

      "text": "Depending on which side of anthropology you fall on, GIS could be a very lucrative pursuit. It goes hand in hand with anthropology, as well as about a dozen different fields. I\u2019d say that it has a use in about every field that you\u2019ve expressed interest in! It\u2019s growing pretty fast and job outlook is really good, so it would offer stability. You can absolutely use it if you find work in anthropology, but if you cannot, you can certainly find employment in something else with GIS. \n\nThis is 100% on computers though, so if you\u2019re not proficient or really like working on them, it might not be the degree for you. Even then, I don\u2019t really like working on computers, but will say that GIS is pretty fun to use and it\u2019s really satisfying to input data and see your results appear. Of course, I\u2019m only getting a certificate in GIS, not a full degree, so this experience might be different for you. Good luck!",

              "text": "No, I think you\u2019d be able to manage without another AA. Most people I know in archaeology that double majored in GIS and transferred from community college only added the second degree after they transferred. Most GIS degrees are fully online, as the program is computer based, so they\u2019re pretty manageable. You may have a packed schedule, but people can do it just fine. There\u2019s usually an internship required as well, which is helpful for future employment. \n\nI would recommend taking an Intro to GIS course at your CC though to see if you enjoy it. It\u2019s a difficult and complex program, so it\u2019s better to get a taste of it before you dive in head first. However, like I said, it\u2019s a really employable field and highly relevant to what you want to do, so I\u2019d definitely try it just to see!",

It won\u2019t be easy, but it\u2019s certainly doable. You\u2019d essentially be doing all the degree requirements in two years alongside your anthro degree requirements, minus the gen eds. There should be some cross listed courses between them too, so you won\u2019t necessarily be doing both of them separately.",

Cultures don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, there are always outside influences that affect them and change them in some way. GIS would allow you to document the spatial relationships between the culture you\u2019re focusing on and those influences.\n\nAs for applied cultural in the business world, GIS would allow you analyze markets that your employer is either involved in or not. You can conduct geographic market research by isolating areas and studying the people within them. By that, you can learn who uses your product, where they use it, why they use it, and how they use it. Or you can learn why they don\u2019t use it. You can then take that information and present it visually to your employer, thus helping them understand the current situation they have in the market and whether to expand, branch out, etc.  \n\nAll in all, spatial information can be really important for a cultural anthropologist in the analysis, understanding, and final presentation of their work. For Biological Anthro, the same applies, just on topics of genetics, evolution, and hominid history and the spatial relationships that  affect them.",

Depending on where you are in the US, it\u2019s not too hard to get signed on as a Field Technician as long as you have some experience if your dream is archaeology. Just make sure you do a field school in the area you want to work and learn the chronology and basic artifacts of the area and you should be fine. Plus, if your learn GIS you should be a pretty good candidate. \n\nAs for colleges, I don\u2019t really know! I\u2019d talk to your advisors and professors at school and ask them their opinions. I feel that your school doesn\u2019t matter so much, just as long as the school has a dedicated and decent anthropology program and is not a for-profit. Try not to go out of state as well, as that\u2019s just asking to owe a bunch more money than you normally would. That\u2019s just my take on it really, but definitely talk to the staff at your college.",
