  "text": "Hi. I am switching my major from nursing after 3 years to a bachelors in interdisciplinary studies. Once I have my bachelors I will go on to get my masters and teaching license to work with elementary school children. I chose a direct entry nursing program to start because I felt like it would allow me to work with people, make good money, and have a very stable career. However, I have got zero enjoyment or fulfillment from the last couple of years of nursing school. I dread the clinical simulations, actual clinicals, and any tests or classes pertaining to my major. I was always waiting for that \u201caha\u201d moment where I felt like this is where I belong and that I could do this as my career. \n\nI finally had my breaking point at the end of this semester. I just finally said aloud \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d So, I set up meetings with the necessary people to learn more about teaching. I applied to some colleges with the teaching major but ultimately decided against it at first and went into nursing.A lot of people said that they had friends who ended up hating teaching and/or that they couldn\u2019t find a job. I guess my questions are: 1. I know an interdisciplinary studies major isn\u2019t that great but will it be useful with my masters and teaching license? 2. Do you think all those stories of people hating their teaching job is because they picked the wrong major just like I almost did? 3. Any advice or guidance. \n\nI will be the first in my family to graduate so it would be nice to hear from those with experience. Sorry if this is not the correct page to post this. I am new.",
