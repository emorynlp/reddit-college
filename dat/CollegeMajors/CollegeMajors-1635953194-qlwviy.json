  "text": "Hi there! \nI\u2019m a stay-at-home parent who\u2019s looking to further my education. \nI am not necessarily concerned about future job prospects as I already have enough qualifications if I needed employment.\nAnyway: \nI am the type of person that can enjoy all kinds of subjects! If someone is passionate about it- I\u2019m intrigued to learn. That being said\u2026 obviously picking a major is tough! \nHow in the world could I narrow this down?",

      "text": "Good for you for valuing education mostly for its own sake!\n\nIs there anything that stands out to you? Anything you\u2019re especially curious about but never took a class in before, or a favorite subject from high school you miss and would like to explore further? Are there any subjects you really don\u2019t like?\n\nIt\u2019s OK to have an undeclared major initially or change it later if your college requires you to put something down. That said, it helps to have some idea as a starting point so you can sign up for relevant courses or extracurriculars and see if you like them.",

          "text": "Thanks XS for the reply! Yes education was highly valued in my upbringing so kudos to my parents too\ud83d\udc9b\nYeah I\u2019ll probably have to narrow down from what I don\u2019t like haha! \n-math (I don\u2019t want to work THAT hard haha) \n-psychology made me uncomfortable\n\nWhat I consistently love:\nCultural anything. I love to learn about the way others live. I really enjoy language study (I know two other languages enough to understand buuuuut not speak too well \ud83d\ude05)\nAlso super interested in historical aspects of religion and current trends in religion. And philosophy. Although I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m smart enough for philosophy at the college level \ud83e\udd23\n\nThanks for letting me ramble my thoughts!",

              "text": "Sounds like anthropology would be a great major for you, especially if you focus on cultural anthropology courses! You get to spend a lot of time studying different cultures, social groups, religious practices/beliefs, and linguistics. I think there\u2019s usually some biology and behavior stuff mixed in as well, but that\u2019s mostly if you focus on medical rather than cultural anthropology.\n\nYou could also study a foreign language or two, either one you\u2019re familiar with or a new one. You can usually place into a more advanced or heritage course if you\u2019ve spent a lot of time around other language speakers but aren\u2019t super comfortable with speaking/writing.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in philosophy, check that out as well! You might be smarter and better at it than you think :)\n\nThat gives you three types of courses to try when you start college. You will probably still need to take a bit of math or computer science for general education requirements, but probably just one or two courses. (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re in the U.S. or somewhere with a similar system \u2014 if you\u2019re somewhere else, the requirements might be different.)",

It could absolutely capture all these aspects. \nThanks about the philosophy encouragement \ud83e\udd70 \nThankfully I\u2019m almost done with my AA so with my last Gordon rule I can take intro to anthropology,  two languages and I\u2019m done. Perfect combo just before settling on a major at a university.\nAbsolutely appreciate this :) \n(My original focus was biology/Med science)",
