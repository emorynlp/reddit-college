  "text": "I am currently in my final weeks of high school and I am having serious trouble deciding what to do next. I have tried to decide based on intrests but the things I am intrested in either require extreme luck to get a job, the job outlook is tiny, or the only viable jobs are things I would hate. I have a really hard time identifying my strengths and weaknessess. Some of my intrests are video games, film, and history. I know that I am generally fulfilled by being creative, I also love storytelling and analysing stories. Currently I am planning on going to community college to complete my general education (and to buy myself time to decide what I want to do without spending tens of thousands of dollars). How am I supposed to decide my major? I would really apprecieate some advice. Thank you.",

I like science, it's interesting, but memorizing the information never lasts as long as I need it to. I did okay in early high school sciences but my circumstances cut my time in high school short. Honestly, my strength is in English; I can write, enjoy writing, and am interesting in different cultures/languages.",

I would focus on your interest in different languages, as that\u2019s going to get you further than an English major will. Try stuff like a foreign language (if you are good with that), or International Studies or Affairs/Relations, there is also majors where  you study different cultures (ex: Germanic Language & Culture.)",
