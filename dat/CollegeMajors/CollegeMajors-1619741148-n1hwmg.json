  "title:": "Benefits of Psych Major vs Economics Major for HR career?",
  "text": "If you don't want to read the story, then the question is enough to answer it lol. Please help, thank you.\n\n\\>> I want to work in HR for the garment industry in Bangladesh bc it's too corrupt, and I want to improve the system ethically/efficiently. I feel like Eco major is the better route to take bc it teaches all the mathematical and economical skills. But I have a hard time in the major and I always hear about ppl doing perfectly fine in HR with a psych degree, which is easier (not easy) than economics. I also really enjoy psychology, and I feel like it's very useful when dealing with the ethics, work conflicts, company morale, etc. 's\n\n\\>>I have to convince my business advisor to let me switch to the psych major (still pursuing HR), because I'm a part of a business fellowship. I worry that they will not let me continue the fellowship if I switch, bc psychology is not a business major, but eco basically is. I'm not required to be in any major...but they might see it as a red flag that I want to switch to psych. I also don't want to tell them that eco is too hard / uninteresting bc then they might disqualify me. So that's why I'm asking for the benefits of being in a psych major. Please help!",
