  "text": "Hi guys. I would love to know what your experiences are and see if anyone changed their minds on careers/majors because of this situation. I know that I certainly did! I was a business major and because of seeing how this virus affected businesses overall, I decided to change my major. I was thinking of Psychology (Mental health is important, but I realized I didn't want to go into research or be a counselor) or Computer Science or Speech-Pathology. Then I decided to finally choose speech pathology because I realized that I want to help and make others happy. Also, I love talking with people. <3 Plus, there is a lot of variety in this field and a great demand.",

It did make me feel like I wanted to pick something kind of radical that would really help others (I was thinking med school track), but ultimately I decided I could do that with my current major too. I knew I didn't want to make any big decisions right now because I am definitely depressed and I knew I wasn't really thinking with a clear head.",

      "text": "I think your mindset for changing majors is very reasonable!  I've seen many people switch into my major (Public Health) to learn health/medicine/epidemiology/psychology/nursing/biology courses to improve lives! Good on you and them!\n\nBut myself? I'm slightly different. Though I still remain a Public Health major, I actually started an Entrepreneurship minor (it's a business minor).\n\nI started taking the business courses, cuz to me, when the world f\\*cked itself, ppl didn't know what to think or who to listen to (thanks politics + social media). If we lived in a perfect world, **science** *by itself* could change the way people think. I totally advocate for STEM, but me seeing it wasn't enough to make these anti-maskers to f\\*cking listen, I realized *my own* truth.....***I JUST WANNA MAKE A SH\\*T TON of money and be the master of my own destiny.*** Ideally, I'd start my own innovative, biotechnology or telemedicine startup and be the CEO (that's why I want business skills) and be as **rich** as humanly possible, cuz **MONEY is what makes ppl listen... whether we know it or not. This way, I can REALLY** ***REALLY*** **help people help themselves.**\n\nEven if I don't become the Elon Musk (or Lex Luthor) of biotechnology/telemedicine (lmao), I'd much prefer being a self-sustaining business entrepreneur doing whatever the f\\*ck I want while my health colleagues go play super hero in healthcare settings. (no slander to health professionals doh! I love them! But I love myself more). (I do, however, slander pure business ppl with no mind or love of health or science...aka Wall Street)\n\nHow come I think this? Because, while everyone is doing online school, they've stayed in 1 house, 1 city... meanwhile, I've stayed in various states/cities, traveling a lot (responsibly) throughout COVID cuz my parents are self-employed entrepreneurs who actually have the f\\*cking time to travel while still making money (my parents aren't college-educated or have \"connections\". They grew up really poor, english wasn't even their 1st language, but they're really street-smart ...and no, they're **not** illegal business lmao...just smart business), unlike ppl whose parents been working 9-5 since they graduated college.\n\nSorry if I sound like a crazy or entitled person...I'm just a 19 yr. old crazy entitled idealist, that's all xD. Let's talk some time!",

          "text": "You have a really interesting experience!\n\nEven though I am going to take a different major, I am still interested in business, more specifically like you, entrepreneurship. I can definitely see myself owning my own private practice in this speech pathology field. I now realize how easy one can be laid off and replaced especially during times like these *if* a field is not considered \"essential\". Hence why I like the thought of owning my private practice and also the variety within this field.\n\nAlso, it's not just money in my opinion that makes people listen. It's **power, politics, fear, and manipulation. As long as you know the** ***psychology.*** Of course, money can be related/a motivator for that equation. If I wanted power, I think I would go into politics or something related to that. (I did want to go into law at one point, but the law field is too oversaturated.) It's also baffles me how many people don't question things especially during this pandemic (The media is lying to us after all) I also wanted to go into media when I was younger, but this pandemic made me wake the heck up. Honestly, you also don't need to wear the mask *all* the time. It depends where you are and how many people are in the area. For example, you don't need to wear a mask in your car. (I've seen **MANY** people do this)\n\nAlso, many people are stressed and sad during this pandemic for a lot of reasons so that is also part of why I am into the speech-pathology field now, to make others happy and see progress. I am still thinking of other things though!",

              "text": "I have a feeling you're a very self-aware person! It makes me very happy to see people like you/us using this pandemic to learn/realize stuff and *actually* be proactive about it! (unlike some losers who are 'just waiting' for COVID to end and learn nothing!).\n\nI really believe this college + youth COVID generation is gonna be really special going forward. Sure, it's made us *THINK* a lot (and that's good!), *but* that's **not** what's gonna make us special.\n\nWe're gonna be special because COVID *is a paradigm shift in the way we* ***act.*** It's forced us to stay home, forced us to social distance, forced us to travel less, forced us to smile less (masks), etc. WE, especially me, are feeling *really* antsy. This pandemic is like a bucket of ice water tossed on our heads meant to wake us up and **act now.** And when we **act,** our world will not just go back to status quo homeostasis. No, we've seen too much death, inequalities, financial hardship, and sadness. This is the first time our generation has actually seen such things on a global/national scale (we're too young for 2008 recession, Civil Rights Movement, or 9/11).\n\nLet's both agree to be the best version of ourselves and let everything we've learned spur to us to **act** and **act now**! Best wishes!",
