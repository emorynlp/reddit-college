  "text": "So I\u2019m all narrowed down to two colleges for next year. Boston College and Lehigh. If I were to go to Lehigh, it would be for bioengineering, and if I went to BC it would be for biochem or neurosci. My plan as of right now is to go to med school after college, but I would like to account for a sudden change of heart over my four years. My question is which major would set me up better financially if I were to stop after undergrad? How much of a difference in salary would the two majors be?",
