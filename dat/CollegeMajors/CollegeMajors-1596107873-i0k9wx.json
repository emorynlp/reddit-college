  "text": "I would say that I used to be seen as the 'smart guy', good at physics and English, doing pretty well on math, but hopeless at chemistry. I used to think that aerospace/mechanical engineering is cool, but now I don't really have any specific dreams for the future, my parents are advising me (not forcing) to get to CS because of the good job prospects and pay. I'm also interested in business and international relations, but I'm afraid that it's because I went to a school that focuses on science so I just got bored on science. Currently considering information systems, but will it be a wise choice?",

Try taking a Java class or something to get a better idea of the major.",
