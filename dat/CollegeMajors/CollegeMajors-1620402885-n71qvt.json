  "text": "I\u2019m having a dilemma and need some advice. I know I want to work with kids, but I do not want to become a doctor or a social worker. I have been leaning towards elementary education but I am not 100% sure. Since I am unsure, I\u2019m worried about majoring in elementary education because if I realize down the road that it isn\u2019t what I want to do, my job choices will be limited. I was thinking of switching my major to psychology since it is a broad major and I believe I can still become a teacher if I decide to do so. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "You should look into speech-language pathology! It kind of merges education, medicine, psychology, and more into one super varied field. The vast majority of speech-language pathologists work in schools, and lots of graduate programs also get you a teaching license so it would be a very easy career change to become a teacher if you wanted. There's also tons of flexibility to switch to different settings, like a hospital or private practice, and the job prospects are pretty good, at least in my state. It is an entry-level masters degree though, so definitely not for everyone.",
