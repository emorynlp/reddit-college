      "text": "IT is generally going to be more networking, hardware, security focused\n\nIS is going to be more programming, software, and database focused \n\nGraduating with an IS degree in a week, and it was a great decision. I am walking out the door with a job paying $60k, which is much higher than a lot of people in my class. I am doing a part time masters over the next year and a half and expect to earn an extra $25k to start. \n\nInfosys is a very hot field right now, and likely not cooling off anytime soon. If you want to learn programming and work in a development field, I would recommend IS for sure!\n\nTake a look at the IS job index from 2019 for a better idea of the outlook with this degree:\n\nhttps://isjobindex.com/",

Like what did you do during your college years along with your college work? Did you do internships? What certs did you obtain if you did? I'm curious",
