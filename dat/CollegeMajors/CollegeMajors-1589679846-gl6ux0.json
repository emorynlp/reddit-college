  "text": "So I've been conflicted on picking a second major lately. I do know I want to have a job working with animals but I don't want to be a veterinarian. I'd rather be a wildlife biologist or a animal scientist. But I've been conflicting things about what you should major in. Some sites say wildlife biology while others say a biology degree is fine. So ideally which would be better? Sorry if its a dumb or obvious question but I just been confused and unsure.",

      "text": "A very open ended question; it all depends on what you personally enjoy and what you want to get out of the biology field. However, since you prefer the zoology side of Biology, here is my piece of advice:\n\nA biology major could benefit you in the sense that it would provide a more broad experience into what the field offers, providing you with multiple opportunities in what jobs, internships, and overall knowledge regardless of what you want to focus on. It is a handy major to pursue regardless of your focus. I think you would have an easier time finding different jobs to boost your experience and eventually lead into what you truly look for in the field.\nA personal opinion, I think you would benefit the most from majoring in Biology and minoring in a subcategory of biological animal science like Wildlife. Depending on where you apply and how much skill and devotion you have to the subject, employers will find that very important in the hiring process no matter where you end up.\n\nOn the other hand, I have experience with focusing on what I want to concentrate on in school as well. Depending on what you value the most from a career whether it\u2019s income or personal interest, your future job will vary.  \n\nIf you pursue a Wildlife biology major, it will directly impact how you get a job. If you fully intend and are committed to pursuing it regardless of the amount of work and jobs you end up getting, go for it. Passion is one of the most important factors in a career. If you think you will be happy and live a comfortable life in the future, then you are setting yourself up for success.\nAnother thing to consider is that you most certainly will not end up getting the career you want right out of school, you have to put a lot of time, effort, and work into what you want to work towards. If you decide to do Wildlife Biology as a focus and want to work your way up in the industry, one of the greatest things we have access to is internships. I cannot stress how important they are, especially in a STEM field. \nTo expand on that, employers are complicated yet simple: they want to know that you are confident in what you are doing and you have the proper experience to handle the job. Thats the whole point of going to school. \n\nUltimately your decision is the best outcome, you are different then everyone on here, you will have different opportunities, shortcomings and experiences regardless of what information I or anyone else gives you. I think it would benefit you to sit down and write up a pros and cons list for yourself to truly decide what you think would make you the happiest. \n\nGood luck, believe in your personal values and be confident in what you decide for yourself. You have an entire lifetime to figure yourself and your future out, this is only one small step into the rest of your life. Fulfill your life step by step and most importantly, whatever you put your mind to, you will always find success in.",

      "text": "You will have a hard time either way. Everyone who goes for biology without a pre-med focus has the exact same idea as you. There are animal conservation jobs you're describing but they are few and far between and even then a good portion of those jobs can be seasonal so you will be unemployed during the winter months.\n\nEcology does what you are describing but leaves you more marketable. However I still wouldn't recommend this career path.",

      "text": "Do biology, My major was in the same college as wildlife biology and the people who are in that major having a hard time finding a job and most places that are hiring wildlife biologist they want people with masters degrees. I not sure if that helps you. Some of my friends who wanted to be wildlife biologist got their degree in forestry but their concentration is in wildlife management with some people like and that way if they cannot find a job in wildlife management they can get a job within forestry.",
