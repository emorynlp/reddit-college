  "title:": "What major best fits my goals for future entrepreneurship?",
  "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to single out what degree would best fit my goals. I want to be flexible, wfh possibly, and have a good work-life balance, good pay and growth. I also want the opportunity to venture into entrepreneurship if I do choose to.\n\nI\u2019ve singled it out to certain degrees due to various personal factors , so no other majors like engineering,accounting, computer science, etc.\n\nI just want help deciding which of the following to pick.\n\nThe majors are: \n\nCIS (Computer Information Systems), economics, finance, or business administration.\n\nCIS is very flexible and will allow me to work in tech and business career fields. I\u2019d have a good understanding of both, I like tech as well, and that would help me in a tech-related business. I would want to rob ably focus more on business roles since I do want to eventually start my own business.I can still get CS careers too with some self-studying.\n\nEconomics is very flexible and interesting too, but it\u2019s a bit concerning because of how you need to go to a prestigious college for jobs and stuff. But I also searched up tons of careers you can get with this degree so I\u2019m not so sure about that, but this would help in my entrepreneurship goals too I think, anyways this is probably the alternative one I\u2019d pick.\n\nFinance is also a good major, I don\u2019t know too much about it but I\u2019m sure it would help me in entrepreneurship. I think the careers of Econ and finance kind of intertwine with some careers so there that too. The downside is that this major seems to be a very prestigious type as well. Really depends on which is more enoyable or prepares me best between those two majors.\n\nI\u2019ve also thought about accounting since it probably has the most positives out of all these, gives me an important skill for entrepreneurs, but I\u2019m worried that it\u2019ll be really boring and tedious and I\u2019ll hate it or something. It does have lots of hours in tax season but it\u2019s not a dealbreaker. I\u2019m not the best mathematical person, I\u2019m more creative I guess but still I think it\u2019s worth considering.\n\nBusiness administration is my last option, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s too broad like management is but still I think it might be wiser to do the other majors.  Yeah this might sound like a cliche, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the smartest, but I think I\u2019d able to manage smarter people to work good and enjoyably at least. After all it\u2019s flexible too so id be able to do numerous careers.\n\nAlso, I know entrepreneurship doesn\u2019t usually have the best wlf balance but for a fall back I would at least want that.\n\nI\u2019m also going to a community college so don\u2019t think I should double major btw.\n\nI don\u2019t know too much about financial careers but I just know they\u2019re very good for some of my goals at least and that\u2019s why i kinda singled out to them\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\nTIA!",

      "text": "Finance and computer science. Business admin/ business management is trash because it\u2019s too easy and general. Economics is good but is very broad and has lots of math, and people usually need a graduate degree for it because it\u2019s more theoretical, while finance is more practical. Also I think a degree in entrepreneurship isn\u2019t worth it because it\u2019s something you can learn on your own through experience, not through classes, which is why business admin and management are pointless. Accounting is also a good choice if you pass the cpa exam, and finance is good if you like math/ investing. Best thing to do imo would be to do a double major if you can keep your gpa up. You can learn to create a business through electives, not an entire degree.",

I don\u2019t think I can double major at my community college but at least if I do computer information science, which is a mixture of computer science and business, I can do finance classes in that.",
