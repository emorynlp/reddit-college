  "title:": "Deciding between majors - Kinesiology or General Studies?",
  "text": "So, here is my situation. \n\nI am a 25 year old woman, working part-time as an administrative assistant at a law office (working on becoming a paralegal with a certificate) and I also work part-time at my boyfriends CrossFit gym. We not only train regular members but we also help train the college athletes.\n\nI am conflicted in what I should major in. Right now I am enrolled into the Kinesiology program but I am not sure if I really want to go into that anymore. Kinesiology is also one of those majors that its better to go into another master\u2019s program afterwards. I honestly don\u2019t want to do that.\nThe paralegal thing is honestly just a job I will stick with throughout the rest of college. I do not want to go further and become a lawyer.\n\nI honestly want to create my own business, maybe by developing a computer game or something (not 100% figured out but I have several ideas). I don\u2019t have it completely thought out yet but I know I want to become my own boss one day. Thats why I was thinking the general studies program. I know not a lot of jobs take that degree seriously. But I could minor in computer science (I would major but I fricken suckkkkkkkk at math). I could take some courses on business management/accounting, computer science, and maybe a few others that spark my interest. \n\nI already have an associate of arts degree, with more of an emphasis of physical fitness courses. But also a lot of generals done as well. I feel like I'm just so back and forth with my majors that a general studies to start off with isn\u2019t a bad idea then I could always go into a different program if something sparks my interest.\n\nI know I\u2019m the only one who can make the choice. But I\u2019m just interested in what other people have to say and maybe some of you might have pretty good ideas that will make me think about everything differently.",

      "text": "If you don't want to go deeper into those degrees and your true goal is to be an entrepreneur, I don't understand your dilemma.\n\nThat is, you don't need a technical education to be a tech entrepreneur. Think of Whitney Wolfe Herd (founder of Bumble), Peter Thiel (founder of Paypal and Palantir) Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba) or Reid Hoffman (founder of Linkedin), to name a few.\n\nI think what you should do is study what you really like and take some courses in accounting, which is the language of business. Then find a business idea that you like and have a future, and then dedicate your life to it.\n\nWhile that's happening, you could try to find a job at a startup to learn how business works.\n\nI am available if you need an additional opinion.",

I do know a few friends that have started a business, I will have to talk to them about the business side of things and get more info.",
