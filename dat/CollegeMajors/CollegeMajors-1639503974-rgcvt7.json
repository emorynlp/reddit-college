      "text": "  \n  There are many amazing career paths in the healthcare industry,   \nall focused on helping patients receive care they need to improve their   \nhealth and wellness. For many, the desire to go into healthcare comes   \nfrom a deep drive to help others and promote healthy living. If you know  \n that you have that drive to help others, a career in healthcare could   \nbe the perfect fit for you. And a degree is central in ensuring you're   \nready for a career.  \nWhile many people feel a call for a healthcare career, many don\u2019t   \nwant to actually be treating patients as a doctor or nurse. If you want   \nto help people on their healthcare journey, but aren\u2019t interested in   \ndirectly working with their medical needs, there are still many career   \npaths you can follow. One of the most popular healthcare careers that   \ndoesn\u2019t focus on patient-care is healthcare management. Health care   \nmanagement is sometimes called healthcare administration, and it is   \ndifferent from nursing and other medical health care careers.   \nAdministrators and nursing professionals focus on different aspects of   \nhealth in their work.",
