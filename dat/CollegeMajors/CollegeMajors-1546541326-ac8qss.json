  "text": "Hello! I think my interest is multimedia and business administration/marketing/Entrepreneurship. I wanna major in them, but can't find a major that combines both of my interest. Im okay to either double majoring or doing one as a minor, but I really wanf to study them . I live in California, so I preferably want to move to LA (Southern California). Also if any of you major in multimedia, how is it? Also if I'm interested in both entrepreneurship and marketing should I just concentrate in general business administration? I want to go study something that I know I would enjoy and can benefit me after I graduate. Any ideas would be appreciated, people. I really think I finally found what I'm interested in and want to actually study them. Thank you guys if you respond. ",

As you said double majoring is your best bet, and if you do a minor you might as well make it a major since it\u2019s only a few more credit hours, and in business many classes double dip to both majors. Let me know if you want any other advice such as your school list!",
