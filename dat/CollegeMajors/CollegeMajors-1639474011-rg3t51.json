  "title:": "STEM vs English major",
  "text": "I'm very confused about whether to do an English degree or go for something STEM related. I know that I will have more fun doing an English degree, but obviously something like CS or Engineering is going to get me better paying jobs. I don't hate STEM, but I just don't want to spend years studying something I'm not passionate about.  My sole reason to want to do English is because I enjoy it.  I don't want to make the wrong decision and have regrets later.\n\nWould really help if anyone could share their experiences regarding a similar dilemma, or if someone could tell me career options after an English degree.",

      "text": "Although I'm not an expert in either of these fields I'll try to give some general advice. First, do plenty of research on the job prospects and salary of both of these fields. If you find that you think an English degree is worth it, then major in it and either minor in a STEM field that you enjoy or has good employment opportunities, or take electives in that field. If you really think that an English degree is a risky option then a double major may not hurt to have, although not necessary. Most engineering and hard sciences are not easily self taught, although CS and math can be easily self taught if you have the drive needed. Self learning one of these could allow you to graduate early with an English degree, saving money, and give you the cushion of having knowledge in a very employable field.",

          "text": "This. Do some research on the most common career paths and salaries for English majors. If you are interested in those kinds of jobs and aren\u2019t worried about living on (and paying off any loans you take on) those salaries, go for it.\n\nI started out thinking I would study engineering, then switched to English after I realized I didn\u2019t actually want to be an engineer and started looking at major/job/salary stats. I\u2019m well out of college now and don\u2019t regret my choice, but you may be in a different situation.\n\nAlso, if you choose English (or really any other major), please, please do at least one career-related internship before you graduate, whether it\u2019s a paid internship or a part-time/unpaid one you do for college credit (in other words, in place of a course or two). Employers are way more likely to hire you if you have at least a little experience. It\u2019s also a good idea to get some extra skills that employers look for, like basic HTML/CSS, Wordpress skills, and Photoshop \u2014 you can probably learn this stuff in elective courses or through an internship.",
