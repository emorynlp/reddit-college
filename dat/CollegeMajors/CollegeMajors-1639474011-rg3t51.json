  "title:": "STEM vs English major",
  "text": "I'm very confused about whether to do an English degree or go for something STEM related. I know that I will have more fun doing an English degree, but obviously something like CS or Engineering is going to get me better paying jobs. I don't hate STEM, but I just don't want to spend years studying something I'm not passionate about.  My sole reason to want to do English is because I enjoy it.  I don't want to make the wrong decision and have regrets later.\n\nWould really help if anyone could share their experiences regarding a similar dilemma, or if someone could tell me career options after an English degree.",
