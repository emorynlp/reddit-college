  "text": "I (28F) am 3 classes away from transferring to a CSU and I was told that I need to pick between psychology or sociology whenever I get to the CSU. I am really torn. This whole time I thought I wanted to become a social worker and now I am leaning more towards a school counselor or guidance counselor. I just want to be more hands on with kids. \n\n\n\nTldr; I have to pick a major and I don\u2019t know which one.",

      "text": "I would recommend psychology, because it tends to have more financial prospects than a sociology degree does, however if you want to make it worth your while I suggest getting a graduate degree in whatever major you choose. Think about which one you truly love more, as well as which one is a smarter choice.",
