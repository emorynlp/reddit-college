  "text": "I'm a rising sophomore currently in International Studies- Asia focus. I've found my passion is language, but every place I go for advice says how useless it is. Honestly, I feel like I should be in Japanese major because I have no want to do diplomacy or government work. I want to teach in Japan after college but I've seen a trend of no one doing it for longer than 4 years. Translating seems like an amazing job but it takes a lot more than a language degree and some studying abroad to reach a good enough level. \n\nI pretty much hate the idea of going into the STEM field. Reddit always talks about it like the golden key but majoring in something like accounting would lead to a life of misery- that much I do know. I've been wondering if I should do a minor in Information Systems, as that is the only \"useful\" major that I could see myself doing. I feel like I could major in Japanese and do IS as a minor? Or work hard to go into a teaching field? \n\nI'm sick of people telling me I'm an idiot for doing a liberal arts degree. I get it, I should have thought it through, but now I just want some solid, not condescending, advice so I don't waste any more time or money. I have time to switch up classes for this semester to get on a better track.",

      "text": "You could learn some Korean and become an English teacher over in South Korea, a lot of English speaking people who want to move there do that \n\nI\u2019m bad at explaining things but I\u2019d try looking into that since it still is asian and deals with language :) \nThere\u2019s a youtuber named Megan Bowen who started off doing that and it could help to check her out\nSorry if this doesn\u2019t help much\n\n(Edit) also Korean is surprisingly a fairly easy language to learn especially in comparison to other asian languages like Chinese or Japanese",
