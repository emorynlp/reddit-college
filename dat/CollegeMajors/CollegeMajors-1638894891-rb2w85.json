  "text": "I don\u2019t know if this is a dumb question but I am interested in a tech career\u2026 the two majors I was looking at specifically were computer software and media applications and computer systems networking and telecommunications. I have always been a low 90s high 80s student in high school but I am a junior and in algebra two my average has been the high 70s low 80s. Am I right to lean tot be networking and telecommunications major because I am worried about struggling in higher math and I am under the impression that there is less math involved in the courses.",

      "text": "Both of those majors are are named somewhat uniquely. A traditional \"computer science\" degree is going to be very math heavy, not an easy major for most students. Cybersecurity, IT, information systems, etc are typically \"easier\" majors, certainly with less math. This is what my major is now, started as CS. \n\nIf math isn't for you and you enjoy technology and networking than go for that.",
