      "text": "It depends on whether you have a career plan that you\u2019re working on alongside your psychology degree. \n\nIf you do a marketing internship or two, join a career-related student organization, and maybe take some extra coursework in web coding/design/marketing, you can launch yourself into a marketing career with solid long-term salary prospects. (Same deal for other careers like HR if you do a directly relevant internship.)\n\nIf you go on to get a graduate degree after you finish your bachelor\u2019s, you could ultimately make six figures, depending on the specialization you choose.\n\nIf you just get your bachelor\u2019s degree, don\u2019t do any internships, and/or don\u2019t do much else to build your resume while you\u2019re in school, you will probably struggle to find a decent job after you graduate. This is true for the more \u201cpractical\u201d degrees too, BTW.\n\nMost of the people telling you psychology is useless are either struggling psychology graduates who didn\u2019t do any career-related internships, people who know someone like that, or people who don\u2019t actually know anything about the psychology major job market but like to spout the false conventional wisdom that there are no good jobs for anyone who didn\u2019t study computer science, engineering, or accounting. (These jobs are a small percentage of the total job market, and most employers outside those fields care about internships far more than your major.) A lot of people seem to think your major is supposed to directly lead to a career all on its own \u2014 this is not how it works for most people in real life.",
