  "text": "Hello everyone. I'm getting ready to start applying to colleges this year but I'm having difficulty figuring out what to major. For a while now, I've been fixed on the idea of double majoring in both Physics and Economics due to the fact that both will help me start tech companies in the future, like Elon Musk. \n\nI figured Physics would offer me the basics of most engineering aspects and economics would help me with the business side. My main goal at the end of the day is for me to be able to make inventions and innovations that will help make the world a better place. I want to work with rockets, help fix climate, and help create more advanced software and hardware. Elon Musk is a very huge influence and role model on me, and also for personal reasons, I want to follow in a similar career path that he did.\n\nI know the skills you know and learn come into place, but degree wise, I am just so confused on what degree could help me the most. Please, if anyone could send advice, it would be very appreciated.",
