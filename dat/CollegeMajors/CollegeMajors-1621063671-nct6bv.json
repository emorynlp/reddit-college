  "title:": "Which major(s) and minor should i choose",
  "text": "I am very much devoted towards physics, whole heartedly. I like coding too. I like application part of maths too like in statistics, cs, applied calculus etc. I absolutely fucking hate bio and organic chemistry ( chemistry in general i don't like that much). I want to be a physicist, but I'm not sure that i won't my change my mind about that later on, i have seen many people who wanted to be scientist but later on changed. So for my major i was thinking of double major in physics and computer science and in my country I can't change or choose my majors later, i have to stick to what i apply for. So, any suggestions will be very appreciated. Plss, help me out",

      "text": "How about aiming for physics major and cs minor and seeing what you think of the intro classes? You can get a sense for what you find easiest as time goes on and how you handle a lot of stem classes at once. Physics was my favorite science class but I don't think I could handle a minor in it since it would add a lot of time and difficult classes, plus calculus 2 kicked my ass.\n\nOh, and a lot of jobs you can get with a BS in physics will be well supplemented with some CS. You don't have to get a whole minor but definitely get some coding under your belt and on your resume if it's not there already.",

      "text": "Allow me to advertise the math department to you:\n\nWe are a very versatile major: while we don't feed well into one particular career field, the skills that are taught are invaluable and can be applied in a wide variety of manners (We can even feed into law school with the logic skills doing very well)\n\nIf you were to take Physics and CS, you'd be doing a lot of mathematics regardless, and with a Math major you'll also be doing some physics (With calculus and differential equations) and CS (Stats will do coding in R)\n\nYou also get a whole new branch of mathematics that you likely haven't encountered in High School: Mathematical logic. This is where you dig into proofs and all that jazz, which is super fun in my nerdy opinion.\n\nIn terms of the culture, Math is a relatively smaller department compared to physics and definitely CS, and as a result it's a lot friendlier and I've found that my lecturers in particular are very approachable and passionate (I put this down to the niche of the department)\n\nOf course, you can combine this with some physics classes or a major/Minor in the subject. It's a highly customisable degree depending on what you're interested in.\n\nTo conclude, join us in the Math department bc we cool",

Considering your hesitations surrounding physics was the lack of flexibility, I think math definitely offers that for you",

In the professional work place, the only benefit may be the critical thinking ability of a physicist. But even that is cultivated in good com sci programs.
