  "text": "this is my third semester in college and i\u2019m trying to decide what to major in. I\u2019m currently in elementary education, but i\u2019ve decided i wanted to do something in which i can start a nonprofit or join one, or do anything that I can help third world countries. i also love writing, so that is another thing. I\u2019ve always been passionate for helping groups and writing and it\u2019s always been a dream of mine to own my own business i love making things my own and packaging things and connecting with people. and I also love kids but I do not want to work at an elementary school. i\u2019ve been looking at majoring in sociology with a minor in entrepreneurship. thoughts?",
