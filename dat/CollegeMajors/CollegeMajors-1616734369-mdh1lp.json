  "title:": "Which Science Major is the best for an undergrad degree?",
  "text": "\nSo basically, I\u2019m in love with science but I DO NOT fancy going to grad school. Eventually at some point when I have more money in my pockets (and hopefully a decent paying job) I\u2019ll return to get a Masters or Doctorate. \n\nSchool is easy for me if it\u2019s over subjects I enjoy as I\u2019m a pretty fast learner. With that being said, I also want to consider bachelor\u2019s degrees that will lead me into a decent paying job. Below are a selection of my favorite science subjects:\n\nPhysics\n\nGeology\n\nAstronomy\n\nBiochemistry \n\nExercise Science/Kinesiology\n\nWhich of these degrees are the best in terms of job opportunities for bachelor\u2019s degrees? Or is there a different bachelor\u2019s degree that I didn\u2019t mention that will give me the chance to focus on one of these studies? Thank you in advance!",

      "text": "If you want a job within the field, none of these will work with only a Bachelors. Almost all of the Science related jobs requires at least a masters.\n\nIf you just want a relatively well-paying job in general, physics will be your best bet. Physics grads develop good problem solving skills that are very applicable to many fields. I\u2019ve seen physics majors be hired into lucrative fields like finance or software engineering solely because they are great problem solvers.",

However, a BS in geology could probably land you a position in environmental consulting or water resources, making around $40-50k.

And I hate to say it, but probably none of these majors (at the Bachelor's level) will get you even a $70k starting salary these days.
