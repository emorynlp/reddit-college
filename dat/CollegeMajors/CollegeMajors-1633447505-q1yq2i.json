  "text": "I have completed my three years bachelors degree in Physics with 6.89 CGPA (\\~2.8 GPA) and I'm an international student. Now that I see, most universities are asking for the four year bachelors or \\*equivalent\\* (idk what they mean by this). Can anyone give me any suggestions for universities/colleges that accept a 3 year bachelors degree.\n\nIn terms of extracurricular, I have not done much except presenting a poster (two times) at a state level competition. And in IELTS, I have received 7 bands (L-8 R-6.5 W-7 S-6).",
