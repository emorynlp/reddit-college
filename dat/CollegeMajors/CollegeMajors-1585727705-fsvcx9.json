  "title:": "(Strategic) Communications vs. Accounting",
  "text": "So.\nI realize that these are completely different majors with vastly different subject matters, but last quarter (being winter) I took my first accounting class and found the work to be surprisingly satisfying in terms of working with numbers and organization and what not. I\u2019m currently a strategic communications major and I write for my school\u2019s music blog, but I\u2019m not really sure what I want to do with my major. Next quarter, I\u2019ll be taking a set of business courses to test it out, but I wanted to post on here to see if anybody has had success with either of these majors. I\u2019ve heard that accounting can be incredibly tedious, and may also feel somewhat meaningless in terms of actually helping people (if you\u2019re working at a big 4 or corporation). With that said, I\u2019m well aware that job security and employment for accounting majors vs communications majors is much higher. I don\u2019t believe strat comm to be useless, but I also worry about finding jobs and the idea that strategic communications is far too lofty of a major and that I should instead opt for something more practical like accounting. Long post, my apologies. If you have experience with either major or have found yourself in a similar position, I would greatly appreciate your advice.",
