      "text": "Psychology, sociology, social work, criminology, human development and family studies would all be good choices. Some states allow social workers to work with only a bachelor's degree, but most require a master's. That said, there are still a fair amount of jobs that you can start with only a bachelor's if you're ok with working your way up the ranks, pay-wise. Some of these include jobs related to social work, like working for child protective services, juvenile detention, or probation. If you're interested in a master's, social work, marriage and family therapy, or school counseling might be of interest. For all of the master's degrees, any of the bachelor's degrees I listed earlier will prepare you for those fields.",

      "text": "Anything involving a psychology bachelor's degree will be useless without a Master's. Keep that in mind. What you should do is get a bachelor's in psychology and maybe a minor in pediatrics if possible. And then do a masters in social work. You could also do a PhD in psych d but that is the really long haul.",
