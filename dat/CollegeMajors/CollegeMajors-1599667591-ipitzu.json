      "text": "Most undergraduates don't know what they want to major in, so they just choose what their friends/everyone else is majoring in, and that so happens to be computer science because of the money one can make from being a software engineer. Or maybe because they want to create video games for a living and think that computer science will lead the path to that career.\n\nHowever, despite a lot of people majoring in CS these days, a large portion will drop the major because maybe they got weeded out, they found out that CS is something they're not interested in, etc.",
