  "title:": "Astrophysics, or Theatre?",
  "text": "I(17M) am a rising high school senior set to graduate in May 2022. I love astrophysics. I would like to study the field, and maybe even work for NASA. I want to search for exoplanets thousands of light-years away, and maybe even help find alien life. I have solid A\u2019s in my STEM classes. But I also love theatre. The stage gives me such an amazing feeling, and has been with me longer than my hope to study astrophysics has been. People seem to think I\u2019m good at acting. I want to keep going. I want maybe to be on Broadway, even. But I don\u2019t think I can be an accomplished astrophysicist AND a professional, award-winning actor (not that I\u2019d necessarily end up that successful in either field, but hey I can dream right lol?). I feel so torn between two things that matter so much to me. I\u2019m not sure if this is the best place to post my issue, but it seemed like an okay start. Any ideas on what I should do?",
