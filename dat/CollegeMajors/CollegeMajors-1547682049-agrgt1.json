  "text": "Hey collegemajors. I'm a 22 year old male turning 23 soon and finishing my time at community college.  Since junior year in high school I've been told I need to know what I want to do and I feel like I've looked high and low for several years now, and I haven't been able to pin down a single major that I feel like is a good fit for me.  I have reached out to career services at community college, taken so many inventory tests and other ways to help me lock in something.  Nothing has really worked out and I'm at the point where I feel like a decision has to be made.  I took some time off to try and see what I could do without a degree and I was fairly successful at a sales job for awhile until I just figured out I wasn't passionate about what I did and lost motivation.  My peak month I made 10k which felt like a hollow victory.  The job wasn't fulfilling and no matter the money I made it never felt like other successes I've had, and I think that was in part to what I was selling I didn't really believe in.  So I decided to finish CC and try back at step one.  I've been extremely passionate really only about fitness and I'm currently pursuing a personal training certification. I was obese at one point in my life and I feel like fitness saved my life in so many different ways.  But I don't feel secure really, because I'm unsure if personal training will even workout so I want to continue my education.\n\n\n\nThis is where I'm suffering is I'm not really passionate about any classes I'd taken during my time in community college.  I excel at a lot of different subjects as long as they don't relate to creativity (like art, theater, etc) and statistics.  But no matter how good I do in any of these classes none of them has really interested me.  A big thing for me is I need the time to follow my fitness passion so I feel like things like medical school wouldn't work out for me.  I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place my only current idea would be getting an accountant degree and hopefully use that to help begin a business of some sort in the future.  Even then I have a huge concern that I'm just going to end up in a bland office staring into a cubicle crunching numbers for the rest of my life.  Where do I even go?",

      "text": "Do you just want to finish CC, or eventually transfer to a University? You seem to be really invested in exercise, so have you considered exercise and lifestyle related majors? Check your university for what they offer, but they could have something like Physical Education or Exercise Science. You could also try body related majors to help you when you eventually go for Personal Training, like Anatomy and Physiology or Biological Anthropology! You already seem to have a goal and a passion, which is personal training, so go for something related to that so it can give you an edge when you try at it full time! ",

              "text": "You can be perfectly successfully with any of those degrees, it just depends on what you put in and what you do with it. Although we all like Reddit, it certainly can be a toxic echo chamber at times. The general opinion of a lot of Reddit users are that if you don\u2019t pursue Engineering or CS, you will be homeless with your degree, even if it\u2019s Science or Math. That\u2019s not the case at all, and you can be successful with any degree. \n\nWhat sort of living do you wish to obtain? Many of those majors certainly won\u2019t make six figures, but not everyone wants to pursue their major because of the money. You seem to want to pursue your passions, and that\u2019s not always going to take you to the biggest pay. I\u2019d highly suggest researching these sorts of degrees outside of Reddit, as they seem to fit your interests very well. Try to compare and contrast the pros and cons of each, and the standard sorts of occupations recipients pursue. Once you find a pathway you like, go for it! ",

                  "text": "I really appreciate the help best advice I've gotten in like 5 years.  I definitely agree with the sentiment of it being a toxic echo chamber.  I am concerned about money in the future following a degree like that my goals were always to make 80k or more with my career (obviously not starting out there). Which isn't impossible for a personal trainer and I think that's my big concern is meeting a degree that fits my two main criteria which is the ability to have a job that is both fulfilling, but rewarding financially as well.

                      "text": "Ah, that\u2019s the balancing act of life! Not all jobs that are fulfilling will be high pay, and visa versa. I will say though that school is seldom like how actual careers are, so while you may feel unfulfilled in the classroom, you might feel fulfillment working in that field. That\u2019s how I am in a way, some lessons are dry and boring, but once I get out into the field I have a blast. Here, what Gen Ed\u2019s have you taken so far? $80,000 is mostly reserved for STEM, so I\u2019d suggest focusing on the science side of everything. Maybe Physical Therapy could be something you\u2019re interested in? They make about what you want, and although to be a full blown one requires graduate school, assistant PT\u2019s still make a pretty penny. ",

                          "text": "I'm definitely going to look into the STEM side which is probably what I would enjoy more.  For my gen eds I took speech, eng 101, anthropology, political science (that was fun), french, algebra, calculus, chemistry, biology (fun), data processing, intro to business, intro accounting, astronomy, personal wellness and health, history since 1945 (also fun), and a blow off summer class of movie appreciation. I have 2 classes left before I finish my Associates of Arts and Sciences. I have yet to try and find some alumni and see how they like their careers I never even considered that the coursework would be very different from the actual experience in the field. ",

They should generally have all the same classes, so you have some wiggle room between the biological sciences if you find one you prefer. That\u2019s good there are classes you had fun in, and I think you should pursue those avenues as they have the best chance of finding that fulfillment. ",

It was a very basic class it felt like high school biology with a little bit more information sprinkled in. I do really well in the natural sciences, but he was far from a traditional teacher. He pretty much made it where he counted no attendance (which is a big deal at my cc) and if you liked you could just do the midterm and final and that would be your average grade which alleviates a lot of stress.
