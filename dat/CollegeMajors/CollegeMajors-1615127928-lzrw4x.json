  "text": " Disclaimer: English isn't my first language. I hope you can bear with me. Also, this was reposted from my post in r/college \n\nSo, I'm a first-year accounting major and I have plans on shifting courses. The reason I did so was that I just realize halfway into the second semester that I genuinely wasn't enjoying my major. This leads us to now.\n\nMy first choice was to go into Psychology, as it was one of my first true love. I chose this with plans to go to medical school and then become a neurologist. My father suggested I go into Pharmacy. I thought it over, and I realized that it wasn't so bad. I kinda liked chemistry in high school and would even prefer Pharmacy over Psychology if I went to pursue medical school.\n\nI'd like to add too, that there is a chance I might not go to medical school when I graduate and so, I try to picture what it would be like to graduate with these two degrees without going to med school. In Psychology, I would probably end up as an HR or a counselor, which is not really what I prefer but I really love learning about Psychology. In Pharmacy, on the other hand, I would take the board exam and be a licensed Pharmacist, which would mean good for me because that job is stable in my country. I know I said I liked chemistry in high school, but I haven't really done it in a long time so I wonder if I can actually still do it.\n\nThis is the crossroad. I'm a really indecisive person and so I wanna make sure I don't make the same mistake again. How do you decide on something like this? Any tips? Should I go with Psychology or Pharmacy?",

      "text": "You could do both, get a double major in Physcology and a science degree of your choice. Then go to get a masters in pharmacy. Then you go to pharmacy school after passing the PCAT. And viola, you are a pharmacist. \nWord of advice: DO NOT go into Physcology without a double major, I\u2019ve known people who\u2019ve gotten the major alone. Phycologists need at least a masters degree to get any decent job. Thus you might want to get a double major or do it as a minor.",
