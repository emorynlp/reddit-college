  "text": "\n\nI don't know whats going on, but I don't seem to feel emotionally strong about anything anymore. I can't think of a single career that sounds enjoyable. I can barely muster up the energy to do something as simple as watching a movie. I'm starting to realize that I've never had strong feelings over any sort of activity or hobby in my life. All I do is work and when I get home I just do nothing until I fall asleep. I just need a career that will provide me with money so that I can continue to sleep until I die. My current major is Computer Sciences (something I also have no feelings over). I just decided to take it for no reason, to be honest. I thought that it seemed normal enough that no one would ask me questions about it and find out that I have no interests. Someone recommended that I switch to Cyber security. Does that sound like a good idea?",
