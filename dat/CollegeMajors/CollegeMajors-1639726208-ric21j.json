  "text": "I want a major that is applied math or has to do with anatomy but not medical school.\n\nI am considering statistics, astrophysics (probably needs more schooling), data science, and neuroscience. Would statistics be realistic? I heard it's not really math, but is applied if it were to be. I am autistic and short term jobs are hard for me to keep up with, so my family is paying but they only can for 4 years. Biostatician is my main guess",

Out of those degrees you mentioned, stats or data science would probably make 80k a year mid career, in some cases more. However, if you want a data science job, I would recommend majoring in computer science, statistics, applied math, or math.",
