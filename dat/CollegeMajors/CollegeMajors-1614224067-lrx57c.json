  "title:": "What are good college majors for jobs in art/design/creative fields?",
  "text": "I'm thinking that I want to work in a creative field doing something like fashion design, graphic design, video game/movie art, fine arts, etc. I don't need a super high paying job, just something that lets me live modestly.\n\nI'm 26 years old and have already spent a lot of time working various jobs, also went to community college for several years but did not finish with a degree. I'm also currently in the military, so I might have to wait for my contract to be over before I can take any courses, I'm not actually sure. I just know that I want to do something different than what I've already tried, and art is something I actually enjoy so it seems like it's worth a try- so far all of my jobs have been things that I'm not really into. \n\nAny comments would be appreciated",

      "text": "Hmm. I went to art school and there seems to be the most jobs in graphic design, web design, and photography. That said, they do not have to be your major. What matters the most when applying for art jobs is your portfolio. If you are concerned about finding a job after graduation I would definitely recommend taking at least some graphic design classes so you have that to fall back on. \n\nYou should also reflect about what interests you about art. Do you like the hands-on process? Do you like the beauty of art? Do you like the storytelling? What exactly about art makes you feel fulfilled? These are things you should ask yourself.",

          "text": "Thanks, that makes a lot of sense. Do you think getting a bachelor's degree is still worth it or is a strong portfolio most important? I am kind of burnt out on school/training, but I figure maybe I should try since I have the GI Bill to pay for it, but I don't know. \n\nthat also seems like a good idea. I should try to pinpoint what I want to do as well since I just have a vague idea right now.",
