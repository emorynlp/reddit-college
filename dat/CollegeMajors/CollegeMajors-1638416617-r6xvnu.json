  "text": "This is my first semester at a community college. Nobody in my family has ever graduated college apart from my cousin so I asked her to help me. She said I should major in communications just because it\u2019s a good versatile degree and because I have no clue what I wanna do yet. Is this a good degree? She is stupid and got a degree in feminist studies so there\u2019s that. Should I switch my major I\u2019ve already failed one class this semester and it\u2019s been weighing heavy on me (it was a math class) what\u2019s a good degree. I\u2019ve heard business degrees are amazing.",

      "text": "If you want versatile with little math, I highly recommend IT. You can get certifications and find a job in network engineering pretty quickly with just the Associates Degree. The pay is good enough to afford a comfortable middle class lifestyle. If you want to transfer to a 4 year you can do that as well and easily end up making six figures. You can specialize in certain things at the bachelors level (I did cyber security). \n\nIf you aren\u2019t into IT, web design/development is also great. There\u2019s not as much money as in IT but everyone I know in web design loves it. As for math, if you ever want to take another shot at it, tutoring and Kahn academy has taught me much more than any math class. Best of luck to you!",

      "text": "Find a topic you are interested in.  What is important is that you get a degree.  It will be easier to stay motivated and finish if you like what you are studying.  IT is a good idea if you are interested in the topic.  But if you aren\u2019t, it will be hell.  College isn\u2019t a technical school.  You want to learn how to learn so you are able to adapt and continue learning throughout your career.  Most people don\u2019t work in the same field they major in. You will likely end up with a job that you don\u2019t even know exists right now.  I was the first in my family to go to college.  I became a professor. I worked with lots of students who were the first in their families to go college. Do everything you can to finish. Good luck!",

      "text": "If you\u2019re interested in communications and good at those sorts of classes, go for it! If not, don\u2019t. \n\nTake a communications course to see if you like it and feel you can do well in it. If you don\u2019t like it, study something you\u2019re more interested in, even if it\u2019s not as obviously practical. If you\u2019re not interested in what you\u2019re studying, it will be a lot harder to make it through your degree, and that\u2019s already challenging enough for most people.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about jobs, your major is less important than getting practical experience outside of class. If you can do an internship (either paid or part-time for college credit so you effectively do it in place of a course), that will help you in your post-graduation job search a lot. I have a degree in English literature and creative writing, which a lot of people think is as \u201cuseless\u201d of a degree as gender studies, but I was able to get a decent content marketing job after I graduated because I did a 10 hour/week marketing communications internship at a local nonprofit and had some writing samples from my student newspaper. (I also made a portfolio website showing my skills/experience and linking to my best student newspaper writing samples \u2014 this is easy to do with a Wordpress template or Wix if you don\u2019t have coding skills.)\n\nAmong my graduating class, the people who got decent jobs after graduating were usually the ones who went out of their way to get work experience outside of class, regardless of what they majored in (this was true for the business and computer science majors too, not just the liberal arts majors.) The people who struggled the most after graduating were the ones who just got a degree and assumed it would be enough. It\u2019s a tough job market out there for young adults in general. Your best bet is a degree of any kind combined with practical experience related to a career you\u2019re interested in, either through an internship, a part-time job, heavy involvement in a student organization, or volunteer work.",
