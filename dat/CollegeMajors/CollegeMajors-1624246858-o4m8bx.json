  "title:": "Out of these Business degrees: marketing vs management, which should I get??",
  "text": "Im going to CSULB as a returning student after a 6 year hiatus and I\u2019m interested in getting a business degree. Which emphasis is better, marketing or management?? I\u2019m interested in marketing because I\u2019m very creative and I like the idea of pitching my ideas to people and seeing them come to life. I\u2019m interested in management because I can take upper management roles at my current retail associate job because there\u2019s a lot of room for growth at the company. Which of these two business degrees, in your experience is best? I think I\u2019m more interested in marketing yet I believe I\u2019d have more opportunities with management, so I\u2019m having a hard time deciding. TIA!!!",

Neither of your proposed degrees is \u201cbad\u201d but I agree with the other reply -> You would get a lot more value out of a major like math, data science, stats, finance, information systems, etc.",

              "text": "Most of the marketing or middle management roles I\u2019ve either held or been exposed to require strong skills in math and analyzing and managing data. Like it or not, management generally requires strong math skills, and if you don\u2019t think you can succeed in a relatively easy academic setting you may want to reconsider your career goals.",

Seems to make more sense than some rando degree lol. I\u2019d rather major in marketing to get into marketing than POSC to get into marketing. I\u2019m just very interested in the major, classes and degree itself. But yes thank you. I plan on doing both emphases anyways just because I can and it won\u2019t take more than a semester.",

From what I\u2019ve heard what they teach about marketing in college is kinda old school as well. The point is, marketing is learnt through experience not through academics.\n\nYou should major in a more hard skill major like finance, accounting,Information Systems etc.",
