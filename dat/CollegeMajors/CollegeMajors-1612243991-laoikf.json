  "text": "I was very much interested in chemical engineering but after hearing ppl saying that it's boring, now I am confused weather to choose chemical engineering or data science, data science has also always been my second option. And I am not planning to do a double major since I will have to study a language in he university which I have decided. Could  someone say me which one I should go for in terms of everything like job security, major wise etc. BTW I am a high school senior",

They're also used everywhere, like data science. But you should know that ChemE will be a harder degree to get with a higher workload, but easier to get hired (even for non-ChemE jobs).",
