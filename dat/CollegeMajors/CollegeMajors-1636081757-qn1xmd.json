  "text": "First semester of college is ending and I'm on the path towards majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm going to be a transfer student going to UCLA. The time has come to start signing up for classes for next semester and I'm not even sure if I want to continue in this major. I don't know much about coding and I'm only slightly interested in physics. Also Computer Science is highly competitive and I don't know if I have the qualifications to be able to compete with other kids. I'm still currently trying to knock out GE requirements first instead of taking major prep classes. I want a major that can give me stability in my future while still a bit challenging. Any recommendations or advice?",
