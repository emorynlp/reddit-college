      "text": "I'm a little late, but I enjoy the the studies of both majors and wanted to chime in. \n\nInformation Systems is a somewhat broad area you could jump into even without a college degree to an extent. Get a cert and start with a help desk position then work up from there. So if your unsure of it, I would recommend first trying it out, then getting a degree if you enjoy what you do. With a degree in IS you could go into cyber security or something more specific. \n\nI'm less familiar with Accounting majors. I took a bunch of accounting classes in high school and really enjoyed them. I'm planning on taking some in college this next term. \n\nCould you consider double majoring? I'm unsure of how rigorous these degrees are at your university, but IS is typically less intensive than something like CS. \n\nDo you enjoy finance, maybe Fintech is something you should consider sort of as a combination of the two. Some schools are starting to add undergrad and grad programs or minors in Fintech.",
