  "text": "I am a MechE student but I\u2019ve always been unsure about my major and had a somewhat difficult but passable first year even though most of it was spent online due to covid. However, I thought sophomore year would be different as it was in person but all it did was made me realize, I just have a had time grasping concepts and it would take me rereading something 20 times to understand it. I\u2019m also pretty sure I did bad on my second exam for one of my MechE classes and I\u2019ve only had one class related to my major so far. Most of the semester I spent on my Physics class as I was doing bad in the beginning but now I\u2019m getting above average test scores and even though I won\u2019t be taking physics next semester, I am not confident in MechE.\n\nDue to all this, I was thinking of switching to a different major but I wanted to stick to my schools engineering curriculum if possible. I\u2019ll be talking to my advisor in two days but wanted more opinions. I always had an interest for statistics as it was always fun seeing correlations in data. That\u2019s why I was thinking of Data Science or Data Engineering but I wanted more information/opinions if anyone could help?",
