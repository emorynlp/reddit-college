  "title:": "What should I Major in?",
  "text": "Currently in community college as a Business major, but I am planning to change it to either: Computer Science or Speech Pathology (I would not mind getting a Masters) I am constantly going back and forth between this.\n\nI either thought about:\n\nA. Majoring in Speech Pathology for Grad School and minor in CS\n\nB. Majoring in Computer Science and minor in Speech Pathology\n\n(The college I want to transfer to after accepts both pre requisites from the Minor and Major for the Speech Path for Grad School.)\n\nEdited: The reason why I wanna change my Business major is because I find Accounting and Economics to be dreadfully boring and that I don't see myself doing this field anymore (COVID-19 shut down a lot of businesses and that made me rethink this field, also Advertising is really starting to annoy everyone lately (More than the usual and I can't blame them really.) I don't see anything challenging/impactful about this field.\n\nComputer Science intrigues me due to the challenging aspect of it (It is declared one of the hardest majors after all) And I would find it cool to learn more about computers, etc in general and create apps, software, etc. Of course, there is so much more to it than that. The tech field is constantly expanding. You can pretty much just work in any field and you need to be a pretty persistent individual in order to work in this field. You can be a Game Developer, Software Developer, App Developer, Software Engineer, etc. Also, the industry needs more females lol\n\nWith Speech Pathology, they work with people with speaking, swallowing, articulation disorders, etc. You can work with the age range from babies to elderly adults and make an impact on others people's lives and form connections with them. There is A LOT of variety in this field! Most Speech-Language Pathologists work in schools, but they can also work in Skilled Nursing Facilities, Hospitals, Rehabilitation Centers and they can even start their own private practice if they wish. They also have the options from working part-time, full-time, or per-diem (as requested).\n\nThese are some traits/characteristics about me:\n\n\\-Kind\n\n\\-Patient\n\n\\-Team player\n\n\\-Loves working with people/helping others\n\n\\-Loves talking to others\n\n\\-Problem solver\n\n\\-Innovative\n\n\\-Persistent\n\n\\-Loves taking on Challenges\n\n\\-Likes math, but not chemistry/physics\n\n\\-Likes English, reading and writing\n\n\\-Loves to learn",

      "text": "I\u2019ve seen your posts abt this before. Everyone on reddit is gonna have different opinions, but from your listed traits, it sounds like speech pathology is better suited for you. If you really want to feel fulfilled/help people, it\u2019s the most direct way. You also need a master\u2019s for speech pathology but you don\u2019t necessarily need a degree to start programming (though it\u2019s useful). I would try speech pathology and if you don\u2019t follow through with it you can take courses in CS or go back to school. just my opinion but your traits sound well suited for allied health professions.",
