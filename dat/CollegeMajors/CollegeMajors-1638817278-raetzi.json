  "title:": "Deciding on an additional area of study",
  "text": "I've been trying to at least roughly plan what I'd like to do during my time in college, and I'm finding myself hitting a road bump. I have my major (and an alternate if I get rejected from the program) pretty much set in stone, but I'd like to have a rough idea on what to do as possible secondary/tertiary areas of study (either 2nd major and a minor or double minor).\n\nI'm pretty much set on an environmental health science degree with a concentration in environmental health biology. After talking to my mom (an actuary), she's been encouraging me strongly to pursue a minor in Data Science. I'm not opposed to it. My struggle comes down to I have *too* many good options; there are too many programs here that *really* interest me.\n\n|Program|Why?|Why Not?|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|BA/Minor Studio Art|I love art, and it's my only real way to take art classes at my college (BA only)|Doesn't pair with ENHS|\n|BA/Minor Medical Anthropology|The cultural side of ENHS, strong interest in content|BA may be a \"waste\" of a 2nd major|\n|Minor Data Science|Marketable skills, enjoyable courses|May be too difficult to get into/complete classes|\n|BS Chemistry (Biochemistry)|Another area of great interest to me, complements my concentration + interest in toxicology|May be too difficult to complete|\n|BA Chemistry|Other ENHS often do this instead of the BS tracks, same reasons for Biochemistry|Dad ingrained the idea in my head that I should always get a BS if it's an option|\n|Minor Applied Sciences and Engineering|Marketable skills, further emphasize the \"engineering\" part of my degree|May be too difficult to get into/complete|\n|Minor Food Studies|Strong interest in content|Doesn't pair with ENHS|\n|Minor Engineering for Environmental Change, Climate, and Health|Pairs very well with ENHS, marketable skills|Requires getting into my major first|\n|Minor Japanese|Helpful in international contexts, language I enjoy|Doesn't pair with ENHS|\n|Minor Medicine, Literature, and Culture Minor|Similar to Medical Anthropology|Doesn't pair with ENHS|\n|Minor Statistics and Analytics|Similar to Data Science, with more of a focus on the math applications rather than applying w/ tech|Focuses more on the math|\n\nIn the end I think my biggest struggle in deciding is that most options are:  \n1. Something that I'm interested in, but lacks application  \n2. Something that I can apply and is marketable, but wouldn't be easy to accomplish on my current path  \n3. Similar to another option without an easy distinguishing factor\n\nJust looking for any advice y'all may have. Thanks for taking the time to read.",

      "text": "Environmental health science and data science sound like they would cover all the career prep coursework you need \u2014 tack on an internship, and you should be golden on that front. \n\nIf you want to pick a second minor/major beyond those, I\u2019d pick a purely fun field. Do something totally unrelated that you\u2019re passionate about \u2014 something outside of STEM and non-career-related so you have a break from that kind of thinking and maybe some stress relief. It\u2019s easy to burn out if you\u2019re taking almost all STEM courses. I\u2019d personally pick studio art out of those, but really, choose whatever you find most interesting.\n\nAlso, not all of your coursework needs to be related to a major or minor or general education requirement. There\u2019s a lot to be said for taking a few one-off courses just because they\u2019re interesting, even if they don\u2019t count toward anything that will be listed on your diploma. Looking back on my college experience, the courses where I learned the most \u2014 the ones that really changed my perspective or made me feel like my brain was literally expanding \u2014 were the ones in fields that were completely new to me.\n\nSide note: I learned the hard way that minoring in a language is not enough to become fluent for most people. Majoring isn\u2019t always enough, either. You might be able to converse well in a class setting, but talking to native speakers in real life is much harder \u2014 people rarely speak as clearly as your professor or as slowly and with the same accent as your fellow students. If you study Japanese with the goal of becoming a fluent conversationalist, you will probably have to spend a lot of time in Japan.",
