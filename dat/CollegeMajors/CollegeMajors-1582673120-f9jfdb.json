  "text": "I\u2019m in community college right now and want to transfer to MSU to get my bachelors. Thinking of getting a BS in nutritional science since it has a lot of classes in bio/chem etc and using it to get into Dental school.. But just incase dental school doesn\u2019t go as planned I\u2019d like to have something to fall back on, what other health field jobs would I be able to get with this degree? In addition, apart from dental school I wouldn\u2019t want to attend school more than 2 more years after receiving my Bs",
