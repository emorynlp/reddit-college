  "text": "Greetings fellow members, and thank you for taking your time to stop here and read this. I am currently going into junior in high school and I\u2019m debating on what I should start majoring in. What are some majors you guys recommend? Speaking for myself, I\u2019m interested in something in the medical field or something business related. I\u2019ve been doing some research on being MDS, PA\u2019s, business management and a couple more. I\u2019m basically wondering what you guys are majoring in, and the pros and cons of the major. Anything is helpful, comment anything! Once again thank you.",

DS is basically Stats + CS.\nMath can also take you in a wide variety of ways (Even Law) but mainly engineering, finance, and IT. It's also a good degree to go into post-grad with.\n\nFor you, just take your bio classes, probably stats over calc, and see what you'd like to continue. You can always enter undeclared since a lot of these courses will have overlap and Gen Ed to complete first",

You will at the minimum probably have to take discrete math, algorithms, CS theory, calc and stats. IDK why you did lackluster on the ACT, whether you are actually not good at math or maybe you just didn't give care about the test. Your future success probably depends on how well you did in your math classes in high school and how strong your fundamentals (algebra, trig, calc) are.",
