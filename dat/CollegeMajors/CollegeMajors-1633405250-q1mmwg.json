  "title:": "College Life Crisis and Seeking Advice about Majoring in Music & English",
  "text": "Hi, College freshman here. Kinda entering a college life crisis over what I want vs what I \"need.\" To put it bluntly, I want to study stuff relating to my creativity particularly music and writing. I've always wanted to work in the music industry growing up, either by singing or more recently directing music soundtracks. I even thought about branching out to education or marketing since it \"sounds safer.\" But of course, I've been hit with several people calling it a \"useless degree\" and maybe try being a \"social worker\" or \"diplomat\" instead.\n\nI thought about writing, particularly about creative writing and maybe entertainment journalism since I grew a very strong passion for writing and literature over the years. Even going so far as to writing my own stories, doing alot of worldbuilding, and analyzing all sorts of shows/comics for fun. I thought about becoming a writer or a showrunner in some entertainment media, or just writing out and publishing my own stories. Hell, I even thought about being a journalist for some entertainment media or an English educator since it seems like a safer career to be in. But like music I've also been hit with the whole \"useless degree\" speech and it's getting on my nerves.\n\nRight now I'm majoring in English and thinking of double majoring or at least minoring in Music but I'm kinda having anxiety right now from all the negativity over the years. I'm very strongly passionate about these things, and I chose to go to college cause I believed it was the only way to explore my passions as well as network with others. My high school only pushed us to go to community college but I thought it wasn't for me since It doesn't really help me with my majors and I was worried I'd get stuck.  I kinda thought about exploring other majors but I realized STEM, Health, and Law just wasn't for me, and I'm kinda iffy about studying business & marketing, and even more iffy about studying Hospitality & Tourism.\n\nRight now I've been struggling trying to find scholarships since the past year I've been in a very, VERY, unhealthy mindset from stress and I just didn't know how or if I'm doing the right things for scholarships.  I honestly had no idea who to talk to about this since my high school was no help and navigating who to talk to about this in my college is frustrating. I'm most likely gonna take loans this year, but I just want some honest advice from people who know what they're talking about. \n\nMy two biggest fears are to becoming a failure and working in a career I have no passion for, and I want to avoid it at all costs.",

      "text": "Don't listen to the whole 'useless degree' bullshit bc that's what it is, it's bullshit. Ppl have also told me my degree is useless (no idea why, but what can you do about other people's opinions, amiright?). Look, you're clearly passionate about music, and true there are safer paths to tread down, but you shouldn't look at those as if they're a monument of failure, but rather just one extra step for you to take to get to where you really want to be. It's all about perspective, and you need to cherish the fact that you now have the opportunity to pursue your passions. A lot of people never get that opportunity. \n\nAs for your game plan, here's what I think you should do:\n\n1. Talk to your advisor and hear their thoughts about this, they can really help you figure things out in regards to academics.\n2. Take out that minor if you decide to go study English, or study music altogether if you become convinced to. There's a niche area for every career, but just know that it won't be easy because nothing worth doing is ever easy, especially when it's your passion.\n3. Don't ever think you're at risk of being a failure. You'll be fine regardless of what you choose, but just never lose sight of your dreams and real goals. Yea, I know that whole 'chase your passion' stuff sounds like bullshit, but honestly, I'm doing that now and there is opportunity everywhere",
