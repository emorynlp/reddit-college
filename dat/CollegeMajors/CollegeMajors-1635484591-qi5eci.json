  "text": "I want to inquire if there are any scholarships that you know of geared towards nutrition/dietetics and/or Hispanic/Latina/Latino grad students. Any guidance would be appreciated because I am a low income Hispanic grad student at the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) Certificate program in my alma mater, soon to graduate with my dietetic verification statement in January 2022. I also have Bachelor's of Science in Nutrition and Food Science with a minor in Spanish and International Business with a 3.8 GPA. Thanks again!!!",
