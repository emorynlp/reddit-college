  "text": "Hi! I am going into my second year and am having a difficult time with my major. I took nursing major classes this past year, but always knew I may not want to be a nurse. I\u2019ve been considering marketing because it\u2019s somewhat creative and there are many options (event planning, public relations, fashion merchandising etc). The issue is that there are many downsides to this major, particularly pertaining to the environmental and socioeconomic controversies of marketing. So I am having a moral dilemma as well and making the change is scary. Do any wise people have any advice? I appreciate it :)",
