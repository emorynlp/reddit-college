  "title:": "Is it worth it to double major in Computer Science and Communication Disorders? (Speech-Language Pathology)",
  "text": "Stuck on what to do. I want to do speech pathology because of the interaction with people and that you can make others happy and help others. But at the same time, I am also curious about Computer Science because of the intellectual challenge with it and the fact that I can expand my knowledge with it. (I never heard of BOTH of these fields until I got to college) At the same time, I am also considering graduate school because speech pathology does require a Master's. It is important to maintain your GPA for Grad School. ",

      "text": "I\u2019m a Speech-Language Pathology major. I don\u2019t know much of anything about computer science, but something that came to mind was working as a SLP and specializing in Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems. I think that aided, high-tech systems (such as speech generating devices) would relate to CS. Like I said, I know next to nothing about CS but working with AAC systems seems like a good mix of the two. Here\u2019s some links to sources that you might find helpful. \n\nhttps://www.speechpathologygraduateprograms.org/augmentative-and-alternative-communication-aac/\n\nhttps://www.aacspecialist.org\n\nhttps://www.asha.org",

      "text": "I am a software engineer and I dated someone who went into SLP. There is an extremely slight overlap in that when you talk about programming languages at their core and what it takes to create a new programming language, you will see some similar words and vocab used in SLP.\n\nIf you were to double major in those and go into software, I think the benefits would be that you would probably be better at articulating what you are doing and/or what needs to get done which is a very valuable skill, especially as you move up the ranks (not so much for when you are a junior dev, but still helpful).\n\nIf you were to go the other way and go for SLP, I imagine the benefits would be that you would be more interested in the technology being used and would be better able to solve problems that are technically related. Potentially you could work for a company that creates the software used for SLPs, but I don't think that would be the most lucrative place.\n\nIf you are just exploring right now, you can look into the field of Human Computer Interactions (HCI). It's sort of a link between engineering and design where you would look at the most efficient way that humans would interact with an interface (such as a web page or smart phone). It's a really cool field, not every school offers something directly related, but you don't need to study HCI to go into HCI (you could study computer science with a design minor or something like it).",
