  "text": "I'll be going to college in fall of 2022. Lately my mind set on Economics for my major in college. It might change this year if I like Accounting in my senior year. I've been thinking getting minor with my major for Economics. Having trouble figuring out what would go with it? I wanna work in Economics career field, that also includes Finance too. I've also wanna work in government agencies too with my bachelor's for Economics. What minor degree would you think best fit my needs for my career in the future?",
