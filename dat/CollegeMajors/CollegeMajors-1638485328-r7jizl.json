  "text": "Hey everyone. I\u2019m currently in community college majoring in Business Admin. Two semesters in and i\u2019m one and half semester away from graduating in it. I am planning on transferring into a four year but I find that my heart doesn\u2019t really sit with business. My whole life i\u2019ve been more into tech so although math is not my strong suit, I am heavily considering going into Computer Science. Any advice for me or from anyone who faced the same sort of issue? I was told that i\u2019m better off finishing up with business and changing majors once i\u2019m in a four year.",

      "text": "I\u2019d go for computer science for sure! I didn\u2019t switch from business to computer science, but I did switch majors to something I was more interested in, and I\u2019m so glad I did. It\u2019s worth it to end up in a field you enjoy.\n\nWith computer science, you can make more money than you usually can with business, so you can definitely pay the extra student loans if you have to take them on.",

              "text": "It sounds like a decent plan as long as you don\u2019t hate your business classes. An associate\u2019s degree in business and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science gives you more breadth than just computer science. \n\nThat being said, you might need to take some computer science and/or math courses before you transfer. At the my four-year college, they usually expected transfer students to have taken a few prerequisite courses at community college to be considered for admission to a major. Definitely check the policies for transfer students and computer science majors at the colleges you\u2019re interested in transferring to.",

      "text": "I think it depends how close you are to finishing the business admin degree. Like, yes, definitely switch to something you actually want to do, but if it\u2019s easy enough to finish that semester and a half rather than spending more credits on a computer science one now, I think that\u2019d be prudent. \n\nCoding is also something that\u2019s more skill-based than credential-based, so I wouldn\u2019t worry as much about what your degree says.",
