  "text": "Hello, all.\n\nI\u2019m currently a sophomore in college and I\u2019m trying to decide on what to do with my life. I was in engineering last year but the combination of Calc and chem killed my mental health, plus I realized I kinda hated my classes, so hard STEM is out. \n\nNow I\u2019m trying to figure out what to do next. I\u2019ve been interested in social sciences, especially psychology for some time now. But truthfully I don\u2019t want to be in school forever, and the salary prospects of social science degrees aren\u2019t exactly the most appealing\u2026 I guess I\u2019m also somewhat interested in business, but I don\u2019t have enough experience to really say.\n\nI considered going into foreign relations because I think I could be good at it and I\u2019m already fluent in Mandarin. I heard it\u2019s really hard to get a job but I guess the job itself seems cool enough. I\u2019ve also been considering project management and product management/UX on the more business-y side of things, but I\u2019m note sure what degrees would be best.\n\nShould I do economics or is that too broad? \n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "With Economics you can work anywhere you want, including international relations. I suggest double majoring though (Political Science or something like that). The good thing about Econ is that if you don\u2019t like one area, you\u2019ll always have a backup plan because it really can be useful in any industry. \n\nHowever, I totally recommend taking as much quantitative classes as you can in your undergrad. Data/coding is the future of any career prospect that will pay well.",
