  "text": "What minor with CS major opens up the most job opportunities/ versatility or have options to work various types of jobs. \n\nWhich of these minors would be best for opening up other/more job opportunities, make you well rounded to pursue a variety of jobs down the road? \n\n(1) general business minor \n\n(2) accounting minor\n\n(3) finance minor\n\n(4) Stats minor\n\n(5) Math minor \n\nI figured math and stat was already included in CS so wouldn't help much and general business is too vague and accounting seems more practical job wise than finance due to more # jobs and direct application in real world/job market. \n\nSo my vote is for accounting what about you?",

      "text": "IDK if I would recommend accounting, because it seems like there isn't a lot of overlap between computer science and accounting. Like you would either pick the accounting route or the CS route, in which case the other degree would be pointless. I would recommend stats or math as a minor, because that could potentially open up a lot of doors in data science/analytics type jobs. just my opinion.",

I think getting a minor in Math/Stats is overkill with the amount of math that you will cover between 2 BS degrees.\n\nThis is tough to answer because it depends on your career goals.  In the business world a business degree paired with STEM is a strong combination.  But unless you are trying to work as an accountant, I would not minor in it.",

That way you can work in business ss analyst types of roles, IT audit, management/information systems. Only thing with accounting it useful if you are a manger or project manager and is a real tangible skills instead of washed down general business. plus it fullgilles 70% req for CPA courses and though that way people can see you can go into business type positions also with your CS and engineering degree. Thanks \n\nwhich out of the 3 would be better? I have to pick a minor its mandatory.",
