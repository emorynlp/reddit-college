      "text": "If you\u2019re mostly concerned about money and jobs, go with finance. The career path is much clearer and often pays more.\n\nIf you hate finance and don\u2019t want that kind of job, then consider English. As long as you love it and aren\u2019t going into above-average debt, it\u2019s still worth your time. Just make sure you do some career planning and make time for a career-related internship before you graduate \u2014 getting a degree alone often isn\u2019t enough to land a decent \u201centry level\u201d job, although that\u2019s true for any major.",
