  "text": "Hello,\n\nSo I will be going back to school this coming 2022 fall after about ten years of not being in school. My ultimate goal is to teach English in Japan, and I believe learning linguistics can help me explain concepts better, etc. plus I just like linguistics (as a bonus). Secondly, I love anthropology, specifically language acquisition, which again is why I've paired it with Linguistics. Now, my biggest question here is, since a second language is a requirement for either major, to just simply major and minor in one or the other. I'm thinking of majoring in anthro since it's broad spectrum,  minoring in linguistics so I have a base, and (probably) minoring in Japanese. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on what I should do? Feel free to ask any questions because I know y'all probably have some. \n\nThanks a bunch. Peace!",

      "text": "I would suggest reading more about what anthropology as a field contains. While anthropological linguistics include language acquisition, it is not something you will likely be studying in an undergraduate degree. \n\nIf that is the topic you are indeed interested in, I would highly recommend that you consider linguistics as your primary track and not anthro. \n\nAlso worth mentioning that about 90% of what you will learn in a linguistics program will not help you in teaching language. Basically, linguistics programs teach you how to study linguistics, not how to teach language, the two are incredibly different topics. If you want to make a career out of teaching, get a degree in teaching and a double major or minor in the specific language you want to teach.\n\nFWIW; have a BS in human geography, have several friends that taught English in Japan, Thailand, Germany, and Bhutan, one of who received both a BS and MA in linguistics. All of said friends are now in marketing.",

          "text": "I plan on going to graduate school for my masters, which is why I wanted to go specifically down the anthropological linguistic route with linguistics as a buffer and a language under my belt. \n\nIs it possible sociology is more suited to me than anthro? I *love* cultures and meeting new people, as well as teaching. \n\nBut you said a teaching degree. So would I get my M.A. in Education of a foreign language in grad school, and worry about learning say, linguistics (since there are jobs out there and I do enjoy linguistics) and japanese as a major/minor in undergrad?",

              "text": "Think about this: to learn a foreign language, do you actually need a degree in it? You could pursue something else in school WHILE studying the language of your choice on the side.\n\nWhat I think is that none of the degrees you mentioned are marketable. I would choose something more like marketing, business administration, etc.\n\nThese are just my two cents according to my experience.",
