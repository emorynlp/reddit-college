      "text": "Computer science and digital marketing are almost completely separate things.  If you are interested in how to sell stuff, reach targeted customer groups more effectively, maybe gather better information about their purchasing habits and desires - marketing.  If you are looking to do this through google ads, social media etc. - digital marketing.  If you want to know how google scans all of the information on the internet, organizes that information, and connects it to poorly worded search queries - computer science.  If you want to analyze the key individuals that are important nodes in a communications net - computer science.  If you want to do digital marketing, go with the business program, major in marketing and be sure to take whatever electives in digital marketing that are available.  Use some fee electives to pick up some digital design, website design/layout type courses.",

      "text": "I agree that a degree in business with the concentration in marketing or whatever your uni has it under is best. You could even minor or take electives in CS/stats for the coding and/or analytics. My uni has analytics courses embedded into the marketing courses for the major and you can take up the minor in stats which has data science type courses to learn the analytics side more in depth. So it depends how you\u2019re school handles it. Let me know if you have questions.",

              "text": "It really depends on the actual job and having the background in web development is useful for seo and ppc. The reason why I suggested business marketing is because even though it\u2019s not exactly required, it still teaches you the foundations. Let\u2019s say you do web development or something in C\u2019s instead, you\u2019ll still have to learn the business and marketing side on your own anyways. So it\u2019s up to you which you decide to do. Especially for entry level, I\u2019ve see companies wanting marketing degrees and I\u2019ve even seen some asking for statistics for the marketing analyst roles. It just depends.",
