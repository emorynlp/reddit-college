  "text": "I currently don't really know what I want to major in. I'm pretty conflicted. There's a big part of me that wants to be a cop, and possible an FBI agent later in life.\n\nAnother route that interests me is helping people. I want to help people mentally, physically, etc like a physical therapist or psychologist but I don't really want to have to go to school forever. Any suggestions for a career path like this that I'll only need 5-7 years of college Max in.",

      "text": "From what I\u2019ve heard, there\u2019s quite a bit of demand right now in the speech and hearing sciences fields. And a career that is often associated with this is being a speech language pathologist / therapist. These are people who work and help people with speech and language issues to overcome their challenges. SLPs and the likes are often needed in schools and hospitals. \n\nIf you decide to go that route, I think you can expect your schooling to take about 6 years in total.\n\n4 years for bachelors degree, probably in something like communication sciences / disorders.\n\n2 years for masters degree in speech and language pathology.\n\nAnd then you would need to get officially licensed to practice I believe.\n\nBut even if you don\u2019t take that route specifically, it sounds like a great field to go into if you enjoy helping people!\n\nGood luck!",
