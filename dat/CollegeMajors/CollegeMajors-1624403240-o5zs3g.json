Don\u2019t let your major limit you. You want to be a software engineer? Sure computer science will make it easier, but you can still become one with a political science degree.\n\nThe people I\u2019ve graduated with and the people I\u2019ve worked with haven\u2019t always followed the same path. I knew a math major that became a dentist, one that became a physicians assistant, a computer science major that became a cop, and one that became a brew master (and now studies chemistry to get better at her job).\n\nI\u2019ve worked with software engineers that studied microbiology, one that studied economics, and one that studied physics. \n\nJust something to think about\u2026",
