  "text": "So in highschool, I was offered college credits for electives in history and science but most importantly (from my shop class) I was offered an abundance of accounting credit courses. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do so I figured why not, save money and time. I was essentially an accounting major set in stone going into college even though I had already struggled with it and did not want to give up. I was not placed into any accounting courses my first year so a lot of my foundation was gone by the time I was in intermediate 1 my second year. After going to nearly all of my professor's office hours and tutoring and of course hours of personal study the best I could manage was a C+. I then took intermediate 2 and came out with a C- so I'm already required to retake it. And I'm currently in cost accounting since intermediate 2 is not available until the spring semester (I am also currently in the beginning of my third year). I tried looking online to look for any other recommended business majors but all I saw were other people that chose to switch into accounting and ended up being good at it! The irony. TLDR I was wondering if anyone could give me some guidance or another major I should look into before I dig myself a deeper hole than I'm already in.",

This might be a matter of just getting a tutor to help you catch up but maybe you should do some research into other career paths that might be a better fit for your skills and interests",
