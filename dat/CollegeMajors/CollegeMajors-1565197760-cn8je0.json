      "text": "I was in a similar situation and I went for economics. My personal interests are more in line with math and science but I had about 80 transfer credits in humanities topics. I just didn\u2019t want to pay to study more humanities or anything related. I like what I\u2019m learning and hope to get a related job when I graduate but I\u2019ll probably end up with close to 200 credits \ud83d\ude2c. It\u2019s up to you and what you like to learn and how long you want to be a student.",
