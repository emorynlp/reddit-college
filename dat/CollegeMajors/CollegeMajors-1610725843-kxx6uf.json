  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m a junior in hs and am wondering if this is a good combination for a college major, a UX design course with a minor or double major of business administration. Also, is a degree even needed for UX design? \nEdit: I would like to do exclusively UX, tell me if this is a bad idea",

              "text": "ok that's not an MBA. An MBA is a masters degree that you get after a four year college degree. There's nothing wrong with a double major in business, it can't hurt, but I don't think it would be that helpful if you wanted to do purely UX. UX design is more a design related career, and I suppose that a business administration major could be somewhat helpful if you took a lot of marketing related classes or something, but to be honest, I think it would mainly be extra work that wouldn't be that applicable. If you want to do UX design, I would strongly recommend to spend as much time as possible designing products, and try to meet up with CS majors creating software and offer to design for them. Your portfolio and experience are going to be much more important than a business administration double major.",

                      "text": "Take my answer with a grain of salt; someone who actually works in the field and has a lot of experience could give a much better answer than I can. I would personally recommend a 4 year degree if you have the money, since that is where you can do a lot of networking and get to know people. I was actually interested in UX design at a point, and managed to get an internship because of one of my extracurriculars, which I only had because I went to college. I would recommend asking in a ux design specific subreddit to get a better idea of which option would be better.",
