  "title:": "Can I go to law school with a social work degree?",
  "text": "Hi,\n\nI am currently an undergraduate sophomore, I have always been interested in law and wanted to go to law school, I am currently majoring in social work with possibly minoring in political science to expand my knowledge in that (not sure yet) I wanted to know if I would get accepted into law school with a social work degree? I love the idea of social work and the major suits me well if it would be considered a deal breaker for law school even though I heard any major is okay as long as my gpa and lsat score are high, I was considering psychology, or gender and women's studies since I love that and I'm extremely into social issues. Let me know what you guys think!",

You need to talk to a few practicing attorneys and you need to research the law job market before you commit to that path.",
