  "text": "What should I major in?\n\n I (17M) might double major and minor but i love being focused on the future, I even have a research paper in progress on the future trends of lifespans. I want to make futuristic glasses that can scan restuarants and see their reviews without even checking your phone. I want to also do machine learning research. I want to also combat the homelessness and food waste crisis by finding a way to convert and extract the methane from food waste to make a biofuel that is more efficient than coal (yes ik theres some obstacles). And also build companies on the side to go large scale...but yea what should I major in. Like a few majors possible not just one",

If you wanna double major do computer science (for your glasses) and then chemical engineering (for your food waste idea & your lifespans), you wouldn\u2019t really need a minor unless you REALLY want too. But if you do then something to compliment your major or just another interest. Granted this is my opinion and you should do your own research and know what you are personally good at.",
