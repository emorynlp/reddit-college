      "text": "Plenty of people do physics and don't end up in academia. This sometimes, but definitely does not always, is a path that goes through grad school. I know people who have gone to grad school in subjects like, e.g., electrical engineering, or worked in private companies that do quantum computation or other things in applied physics.",

      "text": "Hmmm.\n\nYou could go into material sciences or nanotech but that needs a PhD.\n\nA physics degree can help you with an engineering job if you like that. You can work in aerospace, cars, etc. Probably need atleast a master's in that.\n\nPretty sure you will have to go to grad school anyway.",
