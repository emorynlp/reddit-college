  "title:": "Is Computer Programming a separate major from Computer Science?",
  "text": "I can select computer programming as a major when searching colleges, but when actually checking the websites of the colleges, its just computer science. I know computer programming is a branch of computer science, but nowhere does it specifically say computer programming. Does anyone know colleges that actually have computer programming?\n\nI'm still figuring how all this works, so im kinda dumb right now. Thanks!",
