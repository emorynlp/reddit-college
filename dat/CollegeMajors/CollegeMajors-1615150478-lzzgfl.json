  "text": "I am currently a business major with a concentration of finance and am also thinking of transferring schools. I was wondering what are some good double majors I can add on with business. I have interests in public health and possibly want to go into healthcare management or consulting or healthcare analytics. I want to double major or minor just to seem more marketable for post-grad. Any advice is appreciated thank you!",
