I can't do those two things because they're too stressful for me to do. She thinks I'm an object and expects me to do what she wants but not what I want to do. What should I do?\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pylu6t)",

Do it to have a degree that will send you wherever you want to go in life. \n\nEven if you're taking out a loan. I would only look at Healthcare, accounting, engineering or any kind of STEM degrees. Those degrees will instantly land you high paying job right out of college. You may only have to do it for a few years before you can translate that experience to a different type of job that will pay you well for you experience. You could spend a year or more after college looking for a job with the kind of degrees you are wanting to pursue. You will still be able to persue your passion outside of work. \n\nIf you truly want to get into photography, as mentioned above. Just get a cheap car and a good camera and go create an amazing portfolio/Instagram/website.\n\nThere should be a \"listen to your mom\" option. You may not like it but she is right.",

AND I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT A FUCKING BITCH ASS STEM DEGREE!!!! I just want to become an actress so I can voice act and star movies & TV shows. I already have a love for movies and a big dream to be famous one day. I wanna get a job to take pictures and write stories and for probably write for newspapers too. Healthcare, accounting, engineering, and STEM are cool and all, but they're not what I wanna do because they ain't my thing. They aren't the things I chose to do nor what I want in life. And if you wanna torture me with the whole \"your mom is right, you should listen to her\", then maybe you should go fuck yourself 'cause I'm not gonna do this bullshit anymore with anyone who dares to try and raise me up with saying, \"you should do this and that\", type of shit. It is getting really annoying and it's pissing me off altogether. Like I said before, I don't wanna do Healthcare. I'm not interested accounting. Engineering is not what I want. And NEITHER IS STEM OR WHATEVER FUCKING BULLSHIT YOU THINK IS GREAT FOR ME!!!!! I SAID I WANT TO DO ACTING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND FUCKING JOURNALISM!!!!! And if no one is going to listen to me about what I want to do, THEN I'LL JUST NOT GO TO COLLEGE NOR GET A DEGREE!!!! I'll stay at home all the time and rethink my life again to see what's next and find something new to do instead of going to a community college to waste my time.",

I heard the saying, \"Quitters never prosper\", before and I know it's supposed to mean the truth, but really, it means a lie because I'm quitting and that means I will quit because everyone doesn't agree with my decision and are just acting like assholes for no reason 'cause they don't wanna listen to me and just rather be rude instead of being polite and respectful of my choice.",

After spending many years of my life in school, I just wanted to be free. I wanted to work at a cafe and make my own money. I want to voice act and do all those kind of entertainment stuff. I was angry, and it sounds like you are too. And although it sounds like you feel more pressure from family about being in STEM and is burnt out, instead of ranting on Reddit, you should visit you college's counseling/wellness center to discuss your concerns with family and major. They can provide clarity and give you options.\nLike you said, YOU'RE AN ADULT. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES. But the choices you're making are emotional and lazy. You basically said that instead of pursuing what YOU DO WANT TO DO, you want to stay at home and DO NOTHING. You don't need your mother's approval to be tik-tok famous (which can lead to acting/making money) and go on YouTube to learn photography tips. You can even go on websites like Wattpad to get money from writing of you're good enough. You have the resources, but you're not using them because you're not opening your mind up to the possibilities and planning your future. You're hung up on your family's approval of you.\nTake different classes in community college and explore. Don't just take STEM classes cuz like you said, it's you're life. You have the FREEDOM TO EXPLORE YOUR INTERESTS.\nIf you really want to quit community college, THEN DO IT. AND GET A JOB AND DISCOVER WHAT YOU LIKE. Do you know what you need to get a job in photography? A high school degree. So you're all set to be an intern AND LEARN.\nYou should do what you want to do. What you feel passionate about. Your mom isn't right for pressuring you into this, but what you're doing isn't right either. You're feeding on the anxiety she gave you to justify your unwillingness to work for what you want. You have a choice and it's up to you to decide what to do, please remember that. I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself about the future. Life is not linear. Things change and go up and down, side to side. Just because you take classes in STEM doesn't mean you'll end up in STEM. You have your entire life to learn, explore, and live for yourself.",

If you\u2019re not interested in or good at those, you probably won\u2019t do well with those degrees. Also, childcare usually doesn\u2019t pay much.\n\nI don\u2019t know anything about acting, but photography and writing (especially writing!) are both useful skills in well-known/respected careers, such as marketing. If your mom is just worried that you won\u2019t be able to get a job, you might be able to appease her by taking a marketing class or two (maybe add a bit of web design/development, too) and doing a marketing internship. I got a digital marketing job with my English/creative writing degree, and a lot of my classmates also got into traditional marketing/PR/editing jobs. Plus, a couple of them have published books now! :) \n\nWhatever you major in, if you\u2019re concerned about getting a job (or want to appease your mom), try to get some work experience through internships, your student newspaper, a relevant part-time job, and/or freelancing while you\u2019re in school. That kind of thing usually matters more than your major anyway \u2014 and then you can study whatever you want!",
