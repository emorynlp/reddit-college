  "title:": "Should I major in Econometrics and what can I do with Econometrics?",
  "text": "Hi, I'm currently wondering whether I should study Econometrics as a Bachelor's. I'm not in the U.S., so I can't later decide on my major, and am having to do it now within the application process. I have a few doubts, because I really enjoy math, but I'm not necessarily good at it. I'm planning to put in some work before the semester actually starts, but right now I'm just wondering whether I should even look into it. I'm thinking of an Econometrics degree because a math degree seems like a dead end (career-wise).\nFurthermore I've been wondering how \"flexible\" this degree is, in the sense that I'm curious as to what fields I'd be able to switch to that are not economics-related, if I later decide that I don't want to work in finance or insurance or something.\nAny information/advice would be well appreciated, thank you!",
