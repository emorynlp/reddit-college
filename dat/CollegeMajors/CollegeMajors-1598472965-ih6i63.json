  "text": "The title said it all. I just found out about this, and from the info I've gathered, it's a combination of psychology, linguistics, and comsci to understand how human mind works. Seems interesting to me, but how is the job prospect for it, especially since it's a pretty new major?",

      "text": "Philosophy and neuroscience are also a part of cognitive science. There are different focuses one could take with this major, and job prospects could differ accordingly. Someone who specializes in the philosophy of mind aspect will have different skills than one who specialized in machine learning.",

              "text": "yeah I think generally you need a masters degree, or preferably a PHD to get a good job in those fields. IDK much about cog sci, but I do know that it's a very versatile degree, since it combines so many different fields together. I know a lot of cog sci people go into UX design, and also software development and marketing.",
