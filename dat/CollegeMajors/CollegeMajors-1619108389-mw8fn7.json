  "text": "I was originally thinking about majoring in biology before vet or med school, but now I'm realizing that I wouldn't want to be doing bio as a career if I wasn't a vet or doctor, and the pay isn't great for that. How much work is statistics vs other stem majors, particularly bio? Does anyone know about the overlap with premed/prevet required courses? Workload-wise, would it be feasible to pick up a minor in something biological? Vice-versa, could I get a good statistics-related job from majoring in bio and minoring in statistics?",

At my university at least, the MATH major has it's own stream of stats classes which tend towards proofs and understanding of the mathematical reasoning.\n\nConsidering you're already in the biology area, your writing skills from writing lab reports and essays should be covering the stats area that you wouldn't miss in taking the math major.\n\nAdditionally, a Math major is a 'Jack of all trades' major in the sense that it won't gear you towards a particular career but the skills of proofs and reasoning are invaluable. \n\nIn conclusion, ***Join us***",
