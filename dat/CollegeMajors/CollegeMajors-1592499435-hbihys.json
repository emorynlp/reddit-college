      "text": "Architecture school is a LOT of work. I do really enjoy the subject and don't know what else I would have studied, but you will have to give up a lot of activities and fun things in order to do homework. The market swings with the economy but it is possible to get jobs, it's just much more competitive. If you do pursue architecture, search for a school with a NAAB  accredited program and be sure to pursue a Bachelor of Architecture degree (not bachelor of arts) if you want to avoid graduate school. My school did a 4-1 program so I am currently in the fifth year/grad school after finishing a B.S. in Architecture. I can answer most questions about architecture or architecture school. \n\nPsychology has a lot of issues with underemployment from what I understand. It's another degree that will probably require graduate school. Most of the students seem to enjoy the major though. \n\nTeaching seems to vary by topic. I know somebody who went for english education who had a hard time finding a job, but I also know people who went for special ed and science education who did not have as much as of an issue with the job hunt.\n\nEdit for grammar.",

      "text": "I knew a dude who studied architecture. He was SUPER busy. He said that the work wasn't hard, but that it was A LOT. It sounds like he is doing super well since he moved to Berlin (from Los Angeles).\n\nPsychology is a tough one. I took the GRE subject test in computer science (kinda like the SAT or ACT, but specifically for your major in order to get into grad school). This is just anecdotal evidence, but there was 3 math majors, 1 physics major, maybe 8 computer science majors, and something like 200+ psychology majors. To me it was a sign that if you go for psychology and you want to do something directly related to that, then you will be forced into graduate school.\n\nOne big thing I would point out that I've noticed in my 8ish year career is that your major does not dictate which job you get. There are so many jobs out there that don't require a specific major (recruiter, salesman, project manager, ...).",

      "text": "If terms of employment, architecture and psychology markets are not doing so good. Would need a master's for either one for a good career. Psychology PhD is a requirement for some well known careers.\n\nIn terms of the actual major, I have always found education and architecture students to be enjoying their major, architecture suffer though due to the Math Requirements. It's a lot of unique math related classes.",
