  "text": "I really wanna major in history but I don't know what jobs I can get majoring in history. And I don't wanna become a teacher because I'm not good with kids even though I love blabbing my mouth about history and the things I've learned. \n\nThe other things with this is I'm not 100% sure what I wanna do, be, or go. I'm thinking of other options bc this is my last year a highschool senior that maybe I'll like my electives (college engineering and Forensic science)\n\nDo you have any tips or advice on how to choose a major and what jobs come with that major?",

      "text": "Dude, do it. History is the major college with the largest number of US presidents and many CEOs of companies such as ony, Hewlett-Packard, YouTube, American Express, IBM, NBC Entertainment, and Morgan Stanley have studied history. It is one of the best careers in the humanities and far superior to majors like Economics, which are basically Keynesian mathematics.\n\nHistory graduates are also sought after in places like Investment Banking.\n\nFor example, I want to be a hedge fund manager, and I'm going to study philosophy like Carl Icahn, George Soros, Peter Thiel and Leon Black, who studied philosophy and attribute part of their success to that. Interestingly, most of the most successful billionaires loathe MBAs and business degrees. Study what you like and then you find an application for it.",

      "text": "It requires a masters degree in library/information science, but you could be a librarian or archivist. Another growing field is technical writing, thats something I'm looking into for myself, their subreddit is pretty informative. TW is less writing than you would think, and a lot more research/collaboration focused.The Bureau of Labor Statistics is a good source for job overviews and has thorough information on job outlooks, salaries, employment by region, etc. \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/librarians.htm\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/curators-museum-technicians-and-conservators.htm\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/mobile/technical-writers.htm\n\nA couple things to consider: There are multiple mindsets to college, and the mindset you should have is a personal decision. On one hand, college was originally meant for intellectual enrichment and not job preparation. On the other, there are a lot of jobs that want to see applicants with degrees. Do you have the means of paying your way through college? If not, it can be difficult to justify saddling a large amount of debt for a degree that doesn't get you a good job unless you are so passionate about the major that you would sacrifice financial wellness for it. If you have the means of paying through college or an employable skill you can fall back on if you can't get a job with your degree, maybe you can afford to just major in what you want. \n\nOne way to pay for college that certainly isn't right for everyone but might be good for you depending on what you want in life is joining the military. There are way more options than grunts with guns. You could do ROTC and become an officer, you could join the reserves and go to a technical school that helps get an employable skill, or if you cant find a job after you get a degree the military will pay off your debt if you enlist for 4 years. That being said, military service is extremely difficult and stressful and comes with its own set of ethical quandaries. \n\nOne bit of advice when researching jobs: A lot of people say you need to find a job youre passionate about but thats not necessarily true and it can be dangerous for your well-being getting caught up in that. Every job will have its b.s. and its demotivating days, the trick is finding a job that is interesting or motivating enough to get through life. Your passion doesn't *need* to be work. \n\nA final note: your first two years at college are mostly prerequisite classes that you need to knock out anyways. You can always talk to am academic advisor for more detailed help once you're at collece. The one thing that can screw you with that though is certain majors that are more technically demanding (engineering, math, pre-med) have chains of required classes that start at freshman year. If you're considering a technical degree, evaluate taking the higher math classes like calculus.\n\nEdit: adjusted spacing",
