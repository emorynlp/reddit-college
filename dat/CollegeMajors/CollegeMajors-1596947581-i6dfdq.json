  "text": "My girlfriend is very passionate at writting and very good at writting. I want to be more involved in her writting and help her excel in a career choice. She is Native American and very passionate about being indigenous. She wants to bring light to indigenous history that she fews hasn't been brought to many peoples attention. She only writes poems and would like to use that as her style. What would be a possible major she could look into?? I apologize for my ramble I am terrible at writting as you can tell.",

      "text": "Maybe major in English or journalism and a minor in creative writing. Maybe even a minor in philosophy if it interests her. Philosophy helps you to think critically and it will teach you how to analyse (hard) texts very critically (better than any other major imo). It also teaches you to analyse arguments and stuff.",

      "text": "She could double major in english and american-indian studies my uncle did the same thing and is now an American-Indian studies professor (he got his PhD in american indian studies with a bachelor's in English) and he also writes books (non-fiction and fiction) and articles and makes an exceptionally decent amount of money I mean he makes really good amount of money i pretty sure he makes over 200k and I think its mostly from book sales and his blog but also being a full time professor pays well he also regularly has interviews and I think he's been a podcast once or twice but I'm not sure. He is inspiration to me everyone told him that it was a waste of time to study american indian studies for like 12 years of his life and the people that told him that went into engineering or became a lawyer they hate what there doing (not saying engineering is not a fun field or law) and the ironic thing is he makes more money than them they are all not making that much money even the lawyer recently one of his lawyer friends told me that he will forever regret not following his dreams because he thought following dreams are overrated he told me that he wanted to study history and Is so depressed with his job he decided to quit his job because he couldn't take it anymore and worked as a police officer while getting his history degree. That was 11 years ago the guy now has his masters in history and a bachelors in museology he works at a musuem and he wrote a non successful historical fiction book that made some money as well as a history blog which does make him about 30k a year combined with musuem job and he makes more money than he would than being a lawyer and plus he is more happy. I am in college right now studying religion and political science hoping to one day get my PhD all my friends tell me that it's a waste of time and I realize that I am living my uncles experience I dream of having a netflix or Hulu show one day to explain the stories of religions.\n\nFollow your dreams.",
