  "text": "I am a junior in high school and am researching and trying to figure what major I want to take on in college.. I don't have the best GPA (3.2) but I am bringing that up. I can't stress enough that I am *terrible* at anything regarding history so I'm steering clear of that.  I am very good at math (so far I've taken algebra 1 , hon. algebra 2, geometry, next year I am taking pre-calc and calc). I'm also good at English, I've gotten 90's+ in every english course. I am considering a degree in something in the business/finance world but I don't specifically know what/what I actually want to do after college. I don't want to leave school with a major I won't ever use. Anyone have any suggestions/recommendations on how to go about deciding this or even recommending majors?",

I didn't expect it to be the same. one of my parent's coworkers studied abroad and graduated with a math major but has no idea what to do with it and became a bank teller, so I'm looking for something more specific than that at least. I have been looking into computer science and it seems somewhat interesting to me, I'm just struggling with what I want to do after college, career-wise... would you be able to  spitball any interesting careers you know of?",

              "text": "An applied math or statistics major could be quite marketable for a career in quantative finance. I would agree that math can be quite broad, but from the right university, it should land you a career in wall street.\n\nComputer science is great! It is hella marketable in this day and age. It is quite math heavy in some college's though.\n\n\nIf you pair up a compsci degree with psychology, you could go into AI or user interface design. A user interface designs a website that is easy to use and is \"human\" friendly. I can't really explain it well, just search it up I guess \n\nAll the best!\n\nEdit: Just realized that an applied math major could also lead to a actuarial science job.",
