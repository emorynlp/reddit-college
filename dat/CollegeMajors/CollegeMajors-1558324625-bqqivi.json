      "text": "I think that\u2019s a good enough reason to double major. I can\u2019t say I know too much about average career pathways or security in communications, but it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to combine curriculum wise. \n\nThat being said, do you have interest in anthropological careers if given the opportunity? Success in anthropology very much depends on geographic location and the subfield you\u2019re planning to focus on. Even so, I feel that you can be successful anywhere with adequate preparation, so I\u2019d still recommend going for it even if you\u2019re in a smaller job pool. \n\nMay I ask what area of Anthropology you are interested in? My experience is in archaeology, but I\u2019ve been exposed to all facets of anthropology, so I should be able to give you some advice any which way.",

          "text": ":D Absolutely.\n\nI also love archaeology. The last few years I have been getting into paleoanthropology.\n\nI also love linguistics. I think this has a lot of applications in today's business world as well as the study of ancient language.\n\nOne other thing I was thinking of doing, in the cultural anthro world, is being a cultural broker, to help Native Americans recover their cultures or to help them achieve the healthcare they need.\n\nI live in California, but I really dont mind moving. I love travel and have even considered going overseas to teach English (just to have an excuse to live overseas for a year or so)",

              "text": "Oh man, Paleoanthropology is wicked cool! As you probably know, that\u2019s mostly situated within Africa, unless you want to study Erectus and beyond. That\u2019s a pretty niche section of archaeology and it\u2019ll probably require a Masters at the very least to break into it professionally. That being said, during your undergraduate studies, get as much field experience as you physically can. As a CRM Field Director told me a few years ago, archaeology is a trade and companies value the practical skills you have in the field. Field experience can 100% make up for only having a bachelors degree, but I would still recommend at least planning to get a Masters degree at some point.\n\nI would agree that both linguistic and cultural have business applications. In fact, most of the \u201cpractical\u201d jobs that those types of anthropologists get are for large businesses. However, I\u2019m honestly not too well read on Cultural Brokers, so I apologize on not being able to assist you there.\n\nHowever, if you want to assist Native Americans, American archaeology is very much about preserving their histories. That\u2019s where I work and it\u2019s incredibly interesting and rewarding.",
