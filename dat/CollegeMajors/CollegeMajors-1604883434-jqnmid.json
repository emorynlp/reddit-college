  "title:": "I hate my CS major and want to change",
  "text": "I am currently a freshman at a large state school, I joined a fraternity that I am very comfortable with and absolutely love my school, but I cannot stand my major. I am a computer science major and I hate it more than anything I have ever hated before. It is not one of those situations where I am shit at it so I hate it, I have 3.9 GPA so far through the semester in the core classes for the major but I am so stressed to the point where I am having panic attacks every couple weeks, have had a migraine for the past month and have no free time to do anything other than sit here at my computer and code. I have told my parents I want to change my major and they fully support it, I just do not know what to change to. Does anyone know any majors that are very logical and problem-solving that involve not a lot of math or coding?\n\nP.S. If you are an incoming freshman looking at this page trying to figure out what you should major in, do not choose computer science! Unless you want yourself to be isolated 24/7, while you are stressed out and depressed, I would stay away.",
