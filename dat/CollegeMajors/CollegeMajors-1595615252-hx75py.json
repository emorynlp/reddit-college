  "text": "Hello everyone! My name is Adrian and I'm majoring in organizational communication with a minor in business administration (focused on HR). I am currently having a very hard time settling on a major and constantly second guessing myself. \n\nSome things that bother me are:\n- Opportunity cost of choosing a major\n- Wasting my potential when I could be better at something else\n- Employability and salary\n- Cost of school and consequences of being wishy-washy\n\nIn the past I have been interested in:\n- English literature, with certification to teach HS\n- Political Science, I wanted to enter Congress when I was graduating highschool in 2018 (I'm 20 now with my associates degree) \n- Sociology, briefly \n\nCareers and majors that interest me now:\n- Psychology/clinical psychology/therapy\n- Therapist \n- Human Resources\n- Teaching? I think? \n- Law and litigation",

      "text": "\"Employability and salary\" \n\nIf you approach from this perspective almost nothing listed here will hit the mark very effectively. \n\n\\- Psych, requires a PhD before you see any ROI. Most social science/business masters/doctoral positions aren't funded unlike a person pursing a science Master's due to the sheer number of people clamoring for these spots. So expect to be in school for a long time, have one or two emotional breakdowns before finishing your doc, and be around \\~100k in student loan debt. \n\n\\- Law, most law schools have relatively the same cost as med school but if you aren't constantly grinding for the LSAT you will not be accepted into a T14 school which will enable you to apply for jobs with the typical high paying Lawyer salary. If you wash up and end at a T50 or T100 program your starting salary will not justify the 100k+ in debt to go into this profession. \n\n\\- Teaching will always be in demand but keep in mind how often you hear on the news about Teachers going on strike for pay raises, there's a reason for that! Public education is criminally underfunded and depending on your district you may even have to dip into your own funds for basic classroom supplies.\n\n\\- HR, will need a Master, medium salary range, pretty employable. \n\nI would recommend looking into Accounting. If you can do basic trig and algebra you are already qualified to be an accountant. This major is unique as it will allow you to be CPA certified which makes you highly desirable and practically guarantees you a job.",
