  "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am all over the place with picking my major. I go to the University of Miami and am enrolled in the business school. However, I see myself interested in studying multiple topics. I have an idea of what I want to do for my future, which revolves around environmental business or the healthcare administration industry. \n\nThe majors I'm interested are: \n\nB.A. Economics and B.A. in Ecosystem Science and Policy OR \n\nB.B.A. in Entrepreneurship with a minor in Sustainable Business OR \n\nB.B.A. in Economics with a minor in Sustainable Business OR\n\nB.B.A. in Health Management and Policy with a minor in Sustainable Business\n\nIf there are any other suggestions you have for me it would be very appreciated. Thank you very much.",

Internships might be harder cause there specific to working at a hospital but you should be able to get internships which will help you for when you learn coming out of college.",
