  "text": "Well, for college, I plan on majoring in history, but I\u2019m really stuck on what to pair with it.\n\nI want to be a lawyer in the future, but if that doesn\u2019t work out, I want to do something within the government (lobbyist, FBI, CIA, Secret Service, and a Gov. Department). So, I was thinking about majoring in something that could tie into that.\n\nHere are some majors I\u2019m thinking about so far:\n\n- Philosophy (it wouldn\u2019t help me with the government job, at least I don\u2019t think, but it would prepare me well for the LSAT/law school)\n\n- Criminal Justice/Criminology (this might be good for a government role, but I don\u2019t know if it teaches you any valuable skills like history does)\n\n- Psychology (this one I\u2019m not really liking so much, but it may be useful for a government/crime career)\n\nWould any of these be good? I want a degree that will teach me skills. I don\u2019t want anything STEM related. If anyone had any other suggestions, I\u2019d like to hear those too :)",

Feel free to ask me any questions about those if you are still debating what to do. :)\n\nI'd say either political science, public policy/administration, philosophy, or international studies/relations. Personally, I don't see much value in CJ or psych for you, particularly if you are interested in going to law school. They tend to have some of the lowest LSAT scores amongst majors.",

      "text": "At my university, history and anthropology are combined in the same department so I've gotten to know a lot of history majors (I'm an anthro major). I would suggest pairing the two if you have your heart set on history--you mentioned law school and several government positions, all of which involve working with and seeking to better understand people and their experiences. Anthropology is all about that, teaching you critical thinking skills, data-gathering, and a new way of seeing the world. It's also an in demand major among many companies and so far my experience has been that employers and grad schools love to see it on my resume. It's unique, but also very useful!",

Personally, I've found myself really frustrated by philosophy classes because it all feels so annoyingly hypothetical and theoretical at the same time... if that makes any sense? Lol. I know that's probably not much help, but if you've had experience with it and liked it then I'd say go for it!!",
