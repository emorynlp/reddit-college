  "text": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m a 18(f) that is almost done with the first year of university. When I started college, I wanted to be a Secondary Social Studies Education teacher, but then I quickly lost interest in the idea of teaching. I still like history fairly well, so I decided to change my major from Social Studies with a concentration of Teacher Education to History and Criminology, because I started getting into Law and Legal Studies. I\u2019ve always been more of a \u201cEnglish/Art\u201d type of person that Science or Math, but people who go into the medical field make a lot more money and I want to help people with their problems, I just don\u2019t know how to go about it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I want to get all of this figured out before the 2nd semester of my sophomore year \ud83d\ude2c",

I took a PSY 101 class (an intro to psychology) my first semester and I liked it alright, but it wasn\u2019t anything special to me. I remember things and learned, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s what I really want to do.",
