  "text": "So I am two years into my Economics degree, I enjoy the more Macro side of economics and behavioral economics, and also chose economics due to my interest in the stock market and investing. At this point I have started my intermediate microeconomics course and am absolutely lost, I mean I genuinely have no clue what is going on from the first week. This is my first year at a new university and as a transfer student I feel as my previous university did not prepare me as the material in intro to microecon was just about a vocabulary based course and the first day of class in intermediate the teacher mentions it is going to be simple stuff today and he begins using calculus and derivates and just about every letter in the greek alphabet, leaving me lost. I know after one class it seems crazy to drop a major that Ive been working towards for two years but I have been thinking about changing majors regardless as I am unsure what jobs I can find with an Economics major. I already have my minor and was thinking about majoring in finance but was wondering what other majors go well with an econ minor. My interests are data science (which wouldve been my goal with a econ major), investing, behavioral economics, and fitness.",
