  "text": "Hey there! both of the fields in the title interest me greatly, however I've been looking at astronomy for quite a few years. Unfortunately I haven't had much in the way of experience with either except for reading news articles and such, so I don't have a solid ground to commit to a major while I'm still so far on the fence. Currently my schedule is going to be enrolled as dual major astro and phys, but for my gen-ed I can take either a class closely related to my dual major or a class closely related to medicine. I'm also going to be taking intro to astrophysics. Should I take the medicine class just to see if its right for me? My interest in the fields is that Astronomy is such an vast wealth of knowledge to be found, and the universe is just crazy, man. My interest in medicine is primarily on pathology, because, and this is also one of the reasons I like physics, I like to solve problems with limited clues, and going off of tissues and fluids can be quite limited. Thanks!",

      "text": "My experiences in physics and astronomy, as a recent grad: [https://nicholasrui.com/2020/05/24/tales-from-berkeley-undergraduate-physics-and-astronomy/](https://nicholasrui.com/2020/05/24/tales-from-berkeley-undergraduate-physics-and-astronomy/) \n\n I loved it, and have some definitive opinions about how to do it in the most worthwhile way. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about the major itself, or want to talk science (which I love to do).\n\nFWIW I think college is for trying out new things, so you should definitely go for it and take that med class. I took a lot of random classes especially early on, and though I didn't end up studying them I totally appreciate the experiences, which there are not many chances in life to have. Plus, you might figure out that that's what you want to do, and I think the stakes are high enough there that it's worth a shot :)",
