      "text": "I wish I knew the answer to that question. I was undecided when I started college. Ended up with a bogus major. 3 years later don't have a job in it and I hate that major. I guess what motivated me to stay in college was the odd fact that I enjoy school. I enjoy learning and going to class and being a student. Most times, I wish I was back in school as a new freshmen. Maybe this time around I would actually have picked a major that I enjoyed and got a job in.",

I ended up with communication just because I could finish that program and still graduate on time. I was undecided for so long that if I wanted to do most other programs I would have graduated in 5 or even 6 years instead of 4. And I could not afford to do that.",
