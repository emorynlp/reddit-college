      "text": "If you just want to be rich, you\u2019re probably better off in business (especially a finance concentration) or maybe computer science. Psychology isn\u2019t known for leading to super high-salary jobs unless you go on to med school or the right type of grad school (and even then, you\u2019ll have lots of loans to pay off before you can truly build wealth). You can get a decent job with any major if you do the right extracurriculars and at least one career-related internship, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean \u201crich\u201d \u2014 although IDK what you consider rich.",
