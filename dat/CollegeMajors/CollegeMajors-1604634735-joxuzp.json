  "text": "So I\u2019m still in high school so sorry if I don\u2019t understand how this would work, but I really want to get into politics and stuff because it\u2019s something I\u2019m passionate about (and I also love the subject of political science) but that\u2019s kind of risky apparently and I\u2019m still unsure about how it would get me a job after college. So, I also like marketing and stuff like that, so I was thinking I would get a major in business or marketing or whatever and just get a minor in political science. Is this dumb or something? Is there a better option?\n\nEdit: Or should I do an associate degree in political science and a major in business/marketing or something?? Is that how that works?",

      "text": "Politics and stuff is a pretty broad area and the role you want to play may influence your decision.  Did you want to hold an elected office (maybe a senator or governor) someday?  Would you rather be in a supporting role (helping draft legislation, acting as a press secretary, or maybe managing schedules and events for the politician)?  Would you rather work as a lobbyist, trying to gain support for particular political positions?  Or maybe a political reporter or commentator?  Would you like to run campaigns managing the voluteers, paying for television ads on the local news?  Or be a campaign consultant shaping the marketing campaign?  Or maybe you would rather work as a pollster trying to predict who is ahead and what issues are most persuasive? \n\nEach of these suggests different skill sets that you might pursue.  Communications, public speaking, political science; law; business administration (operations or marketing); journalism; statistics.  Most of these will require a full bachelors degree (law would require more).  Once you know what you really want, then you can decide what major (maybe with a minor in another area) will give you that initial skill set.  You need a plan to get you to that first job.  Nobody starts at Senator (well maybe if your last name is Clinton or Kennedy).  You just need a plan to get into the type of politics and stuff that interests you to gain some experience.  Don\u2019t bother planning out much beyond that right now.  You will be able to plan your next steps once you get a bit closer.",
