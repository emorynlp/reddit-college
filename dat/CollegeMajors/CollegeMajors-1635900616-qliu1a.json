  "title:": "Advice on Major Combination",
  "text": "Hi everybody, im currently a 2nd year at UC Davis majoring in Cognitive Science. I picked the major cause I thought I wanted to pursue medicine-- i dont now lol. So, im going to change to Statistics soon and was wondering if a dual degree / double major in B.S Statistics and B.S Mathematical Analysis and Operations Research would be a good / useful combo?\n\nAlso, with the classes I'd be taking on this path, id have more than enough to declare a Math minor, or almost enough to declare an Economics minor. Which one would make more sense for a corporate setting / MBA route?\n\nThanks for reading, appreciate it",
