  "text": "I wanna choose a major that encompasses my love for fitness and working out along with a medical aspect and maybe a nutrition aspect. My goal for a job is to either open my own sports performance gym like Hybrid Sports Performance or be something like a p.a. or p.t.\nSo my question is what should I major in. Should I major as a dpt or a pa or what? Double major?",
