  "text": "Hi guys! \n\nI'm 25 years old, graduating this semester with my AA. I'll be the first in my family to receive any college degree so I'm super excited!\n\nBut, I'm undecided about my career and major path. To be honest, I didn't think I would make it this far; I always assumed the world would end before I got into college. \n\nAnyway, I love learning and would love to pursue my bachelors and further on. I love writing and photography and building houses in the sims and astronomy. I've taken a photography and writing class and did very well. But I've also been teasing the idea of becoming a doctor in mind for quite some time now, but I think I'm too old to start.\n\nAnyway, I just want advice how to over come this hurdle and if anyone else felt the same as I do. \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated \ud83d\udc95\nMuch love, \nElizabeth",
