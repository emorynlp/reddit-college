      "text": "Sounds like chemistry, nutrition, and food sciences/studies are all good options. Maybe even biochemistry. An example of a college I can think of off the top of my head with a pretty nice department in something close to what you're looking for (I think) is NCSU's Food Science or Nutrition programs. I know that NCSU is only one college but I'm sure there's more out there :)",
