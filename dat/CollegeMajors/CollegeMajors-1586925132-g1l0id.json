  "title:": "Should I Major in Communications?",
  "text": "Hello, I am interested in going into Communications Studies. I plan on going to a two-year college to get a more practical and a hands-on experience, and while going for at least two internships while I am in school. I plan to use my internships to focus strictly on going to, PR, Marketing and or Advertising. Then I want to go into a four-year university to study Professional Communications that focuses primarily on those who want to go into, Marketing, PR, Advertising, Journalism, Web-based communications, and Corporal Communications. Do you think I am making the right decision? Thanks!",

      "text": "I think it's a great and growing industry, with the rise of social media and new journalism platforms. As long as you can utilize college to network with others and gain real-world experience, it is definitely a marketable major. It is also helpful if you can spend a summer in a big city (unless you live near one), since cities are where most communications/PR jobs are.",

Now I may have to get use to a big city now haha. Here in Canada, we don't have many versus the States. Maybe I'll be an American one day who knows.",
