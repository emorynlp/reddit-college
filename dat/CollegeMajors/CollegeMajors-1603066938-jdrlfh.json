  "text": "Hello everyone. Currently I\u2019m studying business administration but I\u2019m going to change that to something else and I\u2019m really confused about whether to choose accounting (because it\u2019s the safer option) or finance or statistics. I\u2019m more interested in finance and statistics but i was thinking to take statistics as a minor and finance as a major. Is statistics as a minor is gonna help me with anything when im looking for a job? Or statistics as a major and finance as a minor makes more sense? In an undergrad btw",
