  "text": "I'm thinking of double majoring in English with a writing emphasis and communications. What are some paths I can take with this option? I'm also thinking of elementary education,  but I'd rather have more options than just teaching. So I'm leaning more towards English + communications.",

For marketing I\u2019d say you\u2019re right where you need to be but I\u2019d recommend looking into relevant internships/clubs as soon as possible.",

                      "text": "computer science is by no means guaranteed to get you a job. The entry level market for programmers is saturated because a lot of college students were enticed by the high pay and glamour/prestige. Go to /r/cscareerquestions and you'll see plenty of stories of people who have applied to like thousands of jobs and not gotten an offer yet.\n\nI've looked down further in the comment chain and see that you are maybe interested in marketing and programming. There is definitely a niche for that sort of person in marketing type jobs. If you learn HTML, CSS, javascript, maybe Wordpress or something, that will probably give you flexibility in some marketing jobs, since marketing is such a large field that there are some people doing web development adjacent stuff in a marketing position. job titles like Wordpress developer, html email developer, etc. might be potentially worthwhile. Especially if you learn search engine optimization and google Adwords, that with html/css/javascript could set you up nicely for those positions.",
