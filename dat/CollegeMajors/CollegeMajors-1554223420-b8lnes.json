  "text": "I'm finishing up my sophomore semester of college, and I'm looking at declaring a major next year.\n\nLet's start with what I'm good at:\n\n-Reading/Writing\n\n-Talking to people. I can make friends with anyone and talking to strangers doesn't scare me at all.\n\n-I'm really good at my english classes and my psychology courses, I'm not bad at math but I don't like it. Basic algebra and formulas are okay, but I don't want a job in a field like engineering.\n\n\nI'd say I'm a really personable person. I like working face to face with people, and I'd hate to be cooped up alone all day. I also want a job that would be different from day to day. Recently, I've really been considering Marketing. My school has a Marketing program that leads into a Professional Sales track and I think this could be good for me. What do you guys think? I'm not sure where my school ranks as far as business colleges go, but it's the biggest one in my state and where I want to go. Maybe someone could look that up for me, I go to West Virginia University.",

If you are concerned about marketability for jobs, you could always pair it with a more traditional major or some combination of major/minor. You need to know how to communicate for all professions and many of the courses that I get to take are more applicable to real life than you\u2019d think. It\u2019s not all hypotheticals and fluff, but there are fluffy classes that are definitely easy.",

The thing about marketing is that there aren't a lot of good jobs outside of big cities, but if you're willing to relocate, there are plenty of opportunities. If you do major in marketing, though, I would consider minoring in something to give you more specialized skills, psychology, statistics, computer science or graphic design for example.",
