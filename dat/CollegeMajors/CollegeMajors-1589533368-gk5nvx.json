  "text": "Hi. I\u2019m attending college in the fall and have narrowed down my potential majors to either bio or comp schools. I\u2019m interested in both but am unsure which to choose. I feel like I\u2019m more interested in pursuing a major in the healthcare field but the debt I would have to take to go to med school is a huge turn off for me. Idk what to choose. Any help would be appreciated. Thxs.",

From there on in, experience would matter more.\n\nDo you like chemistry, physics and math? You may be interested in chemical engineering or material sciences. These fields are pretty well paying. \n\nNow remember that a BME degree is probably more useful than a bio degree. Degrees in pure sciences require a PhD to get the good well paying jobs.",

Maybe get some research experience done, travel, help out people in need, and try and work off some of your debt.\n\nI would say that medicine is one of the fields that if you are older, you will probably do well in it. This is because of maturity and knowledge gained from life and stuff \n\nDo check out chemical engineering. It's quite well paying, and will prepare you well for med school.\n\nAll the best!",
