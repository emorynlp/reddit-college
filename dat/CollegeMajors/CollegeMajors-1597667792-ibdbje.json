  "text": "So I'm currently a college freshmen and thought I was coming to the college I was accepted to undeclared but somehow got into the engineering program? Anyone know anything about this major because the descriptions online just beat around the bush and aren't really specific (or the ones I found anyway)?  I don't know if I should talk to my adviser about switching majors because I've already done so many of the requirements for this degree and don't want to spend more time and money. Also my math skills aren't really that good, I had mostly C's and B's in high school, but I placed into Math 151 when I took a placement test by the university because my algebra skills were decent but my calculus skills needed some work. Anyways if anyone can offer me advice and guidance that'd be great, as well as mention any jobs that will take this degree.",
