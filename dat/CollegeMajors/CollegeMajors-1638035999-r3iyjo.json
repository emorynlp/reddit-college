  "text": "For as long as I've thought about my career path I've wanted to go into Computer Software Development. But, after taking a gap year this past season, and thinking about my future more in-depth I've really romanticized the idea of studying accounting for my major. As time has passed this past year and a bit I've really fallen into the idea. So, that said what is the consensus of you all? How long did you know what you wanted to major in? Should I think about this change for longer than I have? I do really like the idea of going to school for this, but my major at Uni feels like such a final decision, and I hate that my interest has changed so late, it's really stressed me out. So, all that said, any advice you all have is greatly appreciated!\n\nTLDR: After taking a gap year from school my interest in major has changed to an accounting study, any advice for me?",

      "text": "I think if this is something you are really considering, a good next step would be to talk to accounting majors/professionals and do more research into what accountants do, and what the material of accounting is like. If that seems appealing to you, then maybe consider taking some accounting classes next semester. I would also think about why you wanted to major in computer science, and what appealed to you about that degree.",

      "text": "I figured out what I wanted to study midway through sophomore year by taking relevant courses and joining extracurriculars. I came in planning to study engineering, so I loaded up on STEM courses my freshman year and joined the bioengineering club. After I realized I didn\u2019t like engineering or lab work at all, I tried some other subjects. I moved into a major I\u2019d always been passionate about (but initially hesitated to study because people told me it was impractical, although it turns out they were wrong) midway through sophomore year. \n\nMost people I knew in college also changed majors at least once, sometimes multiple times during their first two years or later. Note: I\u2019m American and went to an American university \u2014 IDK if this is as common or easy to do elsewhere, so you should probably talk to people in your area and/or post on a forum for the college you\u2019re going to.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been thinking about this, but it\u2019s perfectly fine to change your mind even if you\u2019re well into college. If you\u2019re past freshman/early sophomore year and switching to accounting without having taken any accounting courses yet, it will probably take you longer to graduate, but you certainly won\u2019t be alone doing that. It\u2019s worth it to get the degree you are most interested in even if it means spending more time in school.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to romanticize a major if you haven\u2019t actually tried studying it or applying what you\u2019ve learned yet. I know I romanticized engineering until I joined the engineering club! You said you\u2019ve romanticized studying accounting \u2014 I think you definitely need to try it out to know whether it\u2019s actually for you. \n\nTL;DR: Just take an accounting course and see how you like it. It\u2019s totally OK and very common to switch majors, even if you\u2019re well into college.",

      "text": "People change their majors all the time. I'm changing mine in the middle of my sophomore year. Take classes that you think you will enjoy, don't be set on following the set plan and explore what you enjoy. You'll be able to find a major you enjoy and probably a minor or two as well. Consider accounting with a minor in CS or software engineering. Or the opposite, or something completely different if you realize you hate both subjects.",
