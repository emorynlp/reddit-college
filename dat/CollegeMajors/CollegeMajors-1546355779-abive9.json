  "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nI\u2019m currently pursuing a double major in Marketing and Management. Ideally, I would love to be working in some sort of marketing position (digital marketing, market research, marketing analytics, etc) after college. \n\nI keep hearing that a marketing degree isn\u2019t the best idea as everything in the field is constantly changing, and much of this subject is learned on the job. A finance degree seems to be more employable, gives me more opportunities, and still allows me to choose amongst several career paths (including marketing). I also like that it allows me to build quantitative skills. \n\nAnyone with experience in one of these two majors, can you give me advice?",

      "text": "Business student here. I always love ppl that double major bc there\u2019s absolutely no reason not to! Two degrees for the price of one, opens more career paths. As you\u2019ve noted, degree does not equal career path. Finance degrees can take you into multiple areas like accounts receivable/payable, finance clerk, the list goes on. Personally the beauty of having a marketing degree is that you get to choose what area you go into. Marketing is a rapidly changing field as you said, and often times 90% of these jobs require a degree in marketing bc you learn the basic fundamentals that can be applied to any of these jobs. The skills you learn while earning this degree will help support the on the job skills you learn once hired. \n\nThe KEY to getting full time job offers post graduation is to get internships. With marketing there\u2019s numerous remote internships, in addition to in person internships. Some big corporations such as Starbucks have internships for college students and pay for relocation costs and some other costs as well for the duration of the internship. 2-3 internships throughout your undergrad career will significantly make your job search during senior year easier. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
