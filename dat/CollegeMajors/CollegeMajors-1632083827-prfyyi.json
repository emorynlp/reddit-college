  "text": "Currently, I\u2019m in community college and struggling to choose a degree. I thought about a stem major such as computer science, but I\u2019m taking a basic math course right now and struggling, and I also hate math with a passion. I\u2019m not skilled in art, and law does not appeal to me. How do I search for a major and a career that I won\u2019t have a hard time graduating with?",

      "text": "Zach Star on YouTube has lots of great videos about individual stem majors & how to get started with them! I watched him a lot 3 years ago when I was deciding what major to go into. Math is tough for a lot of people (including myself) and it\u2019s normal for it to not come naturally as other topics. If you\u2019re really interested in computer science I\u2019d say look more into it & stick with the math! Once you develop the habit and skill of problem solving that comes with math, the rest of your future courses (other programming courses, future math classes) will seem more manageable. Good luck lmk if you have other questions",

              "text": "Omg you remind me of myself haha. I thought the same thing too when I got placed into algebra during my 1st term of college. If you develop good study habits and really really learn these topics introduced in algebra, the next courses will flow very smoothly. Algebra, trigonometry, precalculus, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, and so on are all building blocks of each other. If you can find a good routine to learn well in your current algebra class, everything else will fall into place. \n\nI had to drop my 1st algebra course when I started college, retook it the next term and passed with a \u201cB\u201d. After finding out a good routine and really learning/understanding the foundational algebra techniques, I was able to get \u201cAs\u201d in my calculus and physics classes onward.",
