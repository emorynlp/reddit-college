  "title:": "Physics vs Engineering",
  "text": "I\u2019ll be a freshman this fall and as of right now I\u2019m an electrical engineering major. The thing is, I have very little interest in engineering. I am much more interested in physics; the more theoretical, the better. I\u2019ve never been very interested in engineering. So why do I hesitate? I hear physics major is worthless outside of academia (and academia is very hard to get into). My mom has really been pressuring me into engineering because of the job opportunities, and I had a teacher last year who got a physics degree from the place I\u2019m going and he says that there are no jobs for physics majors (other than teaching high school). But again, I would much rather study physics; engineering seems so boring. What advice would y\u2019all give?",

      "text": "Physics major worthloss? Thats not true at all. It is hard to get a job in physics, thats true. But it is not that hard to get a job outside of physics. Physics majors are known as the smartest majors and they are very good at critical thinking and solving very hard problems. Thats why a lot of companies want physics majors. A lot of physicists work jobs in i.e. CS, finance, insurance etc because of their ability to solve complex problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you really want job security: minor in CS. If you are able to write good code and solve hard problems, you will be employable almost everywhere.",

      "text": "I am in the same bind as you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter research I have found that Materials Science & Engineering is a great field.\n\n It is considered one of the most sciency engineering majors. The reason why im looking at this major is because you can decide if you are more of an engineer or more of a scientist. It allows you to get a job after your bachelors (engineering route) or go to grad school and research/teach as a professor (scientist route).\n\nThe major uses both chemistry and physics to describe the properties of the Materials and use those properties to find the best place to be used. You can decide if you want to go the more theory route (which like any other science major you will have to go to grad school) or go into industry as an engineer. To me that is a big plus. Being able to choose if you want to be a scientist or engineer based on graduating with a bachelors gives me reason to pick this major\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions dm me!",

      "text": "Go with what you want! I will be studying physics in the fall, yes you might need to work a little harder than engineering but in the end both are hard to begin with. \n\nFinding a job in any field is difficult, but in the end if you do your best and show your worth you will find a job easily no matter the major. Going with what you want even if it is hard will make it enjoyable more than doing something you don\u2019t like that much. Listen to your gut and brain, don\u2019t let pressure from family affect you. Remember that your physics teacher might not have been the brightest in class or didn\u2019t pursue a masters or PhD which only qualified him for a high school teacher.",

He did pursue grad school but I\u2019ve heard for medical reasons he had to drop out.",
