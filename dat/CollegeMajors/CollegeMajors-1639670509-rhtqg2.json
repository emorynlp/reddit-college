  "title:": "What major works a lot with data (analysis), maps and trends, and has a good career prospect?",
  "text": "I'm really into looking at maps, diagrams, charts and analysing them, looking for trends, reaching conclusions, giving strategic advice based on the data,  trends, diagrams, charts and maps and helping a (potential) company, industry or sector through that.\n\nI like risk assessment and giving advice based on the data or maps.\n\nI don't mind sitting in front of a computer looking at them for a long time. I actually prefer that to going into a lab (or a place like that) to do bench work.\n\nI also don't mind, and actually prefer working alone, or remotely. I'm an introvert.\n\nI just want my major/field to have a good career prospect \"outside of academia and academic research\", cause I already know that most researchers are underpaid.\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the choices I have?\n\n\nThanks in advance.",
