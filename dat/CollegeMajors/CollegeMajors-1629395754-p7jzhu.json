  "text": "hello I am a 16 year old guy looking forward for college I want to pursue a major in either psychology or psychiatry but to be honest Idk which one to choose from because I always been fascinated about psychology growing up and how people develop feelings and think and behave but I also want to pursue psychiatry because it will get me more money and it's almost the same except that psychiatrist can prescribe medical care so if anyone here can help me show me the pros and cons of those two majors that would be fantastic and I would also appreciate to know if I had a college degree in psychology would I be able to pursue psychiatry and skip a few things or no? thank you for taking your time to read this",
