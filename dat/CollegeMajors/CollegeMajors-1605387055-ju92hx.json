  "title:": "Choosing a major with only stability in mind and not passion--is this a bad idea?",
  "text": "Sorry if this post seems negative, I will try to refrain from being negative as much as possible.\n\nIn short, I am not in college for any reasons other than to get a job that isn't in the trades. I have some ideas of what I want in my future, like starting my own business or blog, or pursuing creative writing. I've accepted the things that I am really passionate about I cannot do immediately. I want a major that leads to stability and financial independence have decided not to prioritize passion. At the same time I recognize that I am going to spend so much of adulthood working that I cannot choose something that's too difficult or extremely boring to me. \n\n**I am not interested in working in academia, or attending law school or medical school. I would consider some grad school.** \n\nI am not really sure where my interests and skill sets lie. I don't have a specific subject in mind but I doubt I'd be into engineering or something. There were no subjects I did particularly better in than school. \n\nThe classes I enjoyed the most in high school were literature, geography, US history, and biology. \n\nIt's hard to say which classes have been fun this semester since online school is boring, but maybe my English and Government classes.\n\nI think this is because I liked the discussions and debating, doing research, and didn't mind doing a lot of writing. For biology, I liked learning about genetics and early earth history. \n\n**I'd like to think I am good at and enjoy researching. I like writing. I am indifferent towards math; I like solving math problems. I like designing and planning things. Sorry if that's vague.** \n\nWhen I think of a future career all I can think of is I'd like a desk job. I don't really know what salary since that depends on so many things. I just want something that is not underpaid or very difficult to find a decent paying full time job in. \n\nI'm not sure if I want a career in a helping profession such as therapy. Maybe healthcare, but again, I'm not sure if I'll be passionate enough. I don't really want to be a K-12 teacher either. \n\n**Some majors I was thinking of: Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Social Work, Geoinformatics**",

      "text": "I just have one contribution to this:\n\nDon't even think about healthcare unless you have passion for it. It's not a light career path and it's far from \"stable\" the way you want. Burnout is real and you're face with so many stupid people, events, and extra little bullshit sprinkled along the way. It takes wanting to be here to get through it without wanting to go back to school to get tf out.",

      "text": "So remember to list all your factors and opportunities you have as an undergrad: \npotential double majors? \nMinors? \nCertificates? \nInternships? \nGrad school?\n\nAll these choices depend on your plan. With so many of the above options available at literally every college, you have to start prioritizing stuff.\n\nSecondly start dividing up the fields of study and choose one or two from each discipline. For example: \n\nBusiness Field: (Accounting)\nNatural Science: (Biology or Biochemistry)\nSocial Science: (Economics or Political Science)\nEngineering: (N/A for you, like you said)\nHealthcare: (Pre-PA, Premed, Pre-Pharma orNursing)\nTechnology: (Computer Science?)\n\nNow compare and contrast those 5 fields of study and think about it. What would you like? If it is hard to choose one, is it practical to double major? If not, how about a major and a minor? If not that how about going to grad school?\n\nSo as you can see there are many factors. I personally used this method and recommended this to others for decision making.\n\nI am majoring in Political Science and Economics with a certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling",

      "text": "Nursing is something you can look into. It uses a lot of biology, you get to interact with patients and work in a team of medical staff. Little math is needed. Average pay can range from $32k to $60k right out of college depending on the area you work in. You can also work as a CNA (after two years of nursing schoo) or in an ambulance to earn extra money while earning your degree. After college you can go back to school for two years to become a registered nurse.",

      "text": "Before I got to the bottom of your post, my thought was Accounting. The only thing that stuck out was the indifference towards math, as it\u2019s obviously unavoidable in accounting. \n\nI chose my major similarly to you, but my indifference towards math pushed me towards information systems. I am learning a lot of software development and project management, with some math and a lot of programming thrown in.",
