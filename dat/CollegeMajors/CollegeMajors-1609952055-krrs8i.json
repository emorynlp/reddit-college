  "title:": "Forensic science major here, thinking about switching but unsure to what",
  "text": "I'm currently a freshman and just finished my first semester. Taking forensic science means I am required to minor in chemistry... which sucks for me because I absolutely hate chemistry. I also found out being a forensic scientist means you have to appear in court... which ALSO sucks for me because I'm horrible at speaking and articulating what I want to say.\n\nOne of my classes was an introduction bio class, and I found that I enjoyed it, especially the units regarding genetics. Because of that I've been thinking of changing my major to something biology related but I don't know what would be a good fit.\n\nSome more general info that could help: I am interested in cells, using microscopes, using computers, film, and photography; I have ADHD; I despise writing papers and reports; I hate math\n\nThanks in advance :)",
