  "title:": "What undergrad major should I do for Quantitative Finance?",
  "text": "I am interested in pursuing a career in quantitative finance. Not many universities offer this as an undergrad major though, so I was wondering if I should major in regular finance as an undergrad and then do Quantitative finance as a masters degree. However, other people have said that I should do a bachelor's in computer science or mathematics. Therefore, I'm really confused on which major I should do as an undergrad. Some advice from people in the field would really be helpful and appreciated.",

      "text": "math or applied math are the most common majors among quant people I've heard from. Other popular majors are physics, statistics, computer science. I think the interview prep you do and your extracurricular experiences will be more important. Many quant people also participate in math/physics competitions, might be something you would want to look at. I watched this interview a while ago with a quant, you might find it interesting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd2Kh80ZK6k",
