  "text": "I am intrigued by the idea of decoding and replicating brain signals. I would love to work in that area doing research and/or implementing that research, either at a university or a company like Neuralink. I also have an interest in Space and would love to be able to do research on the ISS. I\u2019d like an engineering degree as opposed to a science degree because I\u2019ve heard science degrees aren\u2019t too useful for finding jobs. I\u2019ve been looking at chemical engineering, biochemical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Or should I look into software or computer engineering? I\u2019ll probably be getting my degree from either UC Berkeley or UC Davis if that matters. Any help or advice is much appreciated!!",

I\u2019m not sure what electrical engineering entails and I\u2019m not particularly interested in the subject but if it will get me where I want to go I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll learn to love it.\n\nedit: just read this [article](https://neuronline.sfn.org/career-paths/cynthia-chestek-on-her-career-bridging-neuroscience-and-electrical-engineering) where an electrical engineer equates the nervous system to a circuit - that was enough to get me interested!",

I know it\u2019s an ambitious goal and Berkeley would be a reach but I really think Davis is possible if I try my hardest. Worst case I go to a different UC school; atleast I know now what major I want though :)",

      "text": "A lot of the research for those fields is build on computer science as well, if you're at all interested in programming. I work with physicists who are building really interesting computer models to test real world problems and solutions, but they need a computer science perspective (me, eventually, though I'm still just an undergraduate student for now) to make the programs more efficient. However, I can totally see the desire to be on the research side of things (and obv, there's a ton of need for that too!), but CS is definitely worth considering if you're interested. Good luck!!",

I used to code stories for fun when I was younger so I can see myself being passionate about CS especially when relating to neuroscience. Davis\u2019 CS+engineering major and Berkeley\u2019s EE&CS seem like my best bets. It makes me sad that I\u2019m moving away from biological sciences as neuroscience is where my passion lies, though I could always take on a minor.",

There's some interesting stuff happening in the CS + biology area, so I've been told at least, I've never been that interested in bio so I don't know much about it myself. However, CS is a great field for finding secondary interests because almost any field will have research built on it. If you head in that direction, you can specialize with whatever catches your interest once in school, or even switch out of CS and just use your programming experience as a resume plus. It'll be very useful in almost any scientific or engineering job, no matter what direction you end up going in. It's a great place to start, in any case!",
