  "text": "I'm looking to study the cultural and sociological parts of paraphilia. I'm an abuse survivor, and I'd like to contribute to helping stop that through my research. My biggest problem is that I don't know what I should study for that. English/media studies? Sociology? Gender and sexuality studies? I'm really unsure.\n\nEdit: I don't think Psych would really be what I'm looking for.",
