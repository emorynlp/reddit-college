See how you feel after taking Psych 101 in college and after considering some of the more obviously \u201cpractical\u201d majors. Computer science, accounting, and engineering majors tend to have better job prospects, but not everyone can or wants to do those jobs.\n\nYou typically need a graduate degree to get a job that is very closely related to psychology (counselor, psychiatrist, industrial organizational psychologist, psychology research, etc.), but you can get a decent job that\u2019s more vaguely related with just a bachelors degree IF you do career-related internships, go out of your way to get some extra career-related skills, and join relevant student organizations. I know a couple of former psych majors who got into marketing that way.\n\nTo the other commentors: Psychology isn\u2019t \u201cuseless.\u201d If you are smart about doing an internship or two, building extra skills outside of your major, and joining relevant student organizations (which people in \u201cpractical\u201d majors usually have to do too), you can get a good job with any degree. Look up the stats \u2014 sure, the average psychology major doesn\u2019t earn as much as the average computer science major, but they definitely do better than most people without a degree. (Believe it or not, decent jobs exist outside of the tech industry, which accounts for less than 8% of the total US workforce.) Yes, some psych majors end up underemployed, but I know plenty of former science and tech majors who are in the same boat. You can\u2019t just get a degree, do nothing else to boost your job prospects, and expect results in today\u2019s world.",

On day one, the dean informed us that we needed a graduate degree if we wanted a career in the psychology field. Many psychology students are unaware, so they end up working in a field that has absolutely nothing to do with psychology after graduation. \nMy brother\u2019s friend graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in psychology. He ended up in retail and considered going back to school for his master\u2019s. But since he couldn\u2019t afford his medical bills, he died from a curable illness. I don\u2019t want the OP to be crippled with student loan debt for a bachelor\u2019s degree that she probably won\u2019t use. A psych degree is only worth if you plan to go all the way; I wouldn\u2019t recommend to someone on the fence",

People say Psych is a useless major all the time, but it's really the experiences that you get during college. Such as having internships, networking. It's really not a useless major and its beyond annoying when people say that. And you're right- I'm a Psych major and comp sci/engineering was not the path for me and I hate how people make it seem as though those majors are the only 'useful' ones out there.",
