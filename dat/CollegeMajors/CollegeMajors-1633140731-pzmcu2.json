      "text": "Don\u2019t worry about failing at college, at least not just yet! You don\u2019t know how you will do until you get there. Some people thrive more in a college environment than they did in high school.\n\nTo answer your question, it depends on the college and on the high school courses you took. Some of my friends who took AP courses in high school and then went to the local community college said most of their college classes were easier. On the other hand, STEM courses at a super competitive/rigorous university with lots of premed students may be a step up. \n\nEither way, you can succeed if you build good study skills, dedicate enough time to studying, and seek out help from professors/TAs/tutors/peers when you need to.",

      "text": "As others have said, there are a lot of depending factors-professors do make a huge difference-but think about this: when you were young in school and still learning basic information, did you ever see examples of high school level work and wonder how you'd ever know how to do that? This is the same thing. It's a process, so remember to work hard in classes so you can apply the information later on when you need to, but you'll get there. It's hard and it's a lot of work, but don't forget you're surrounded by people in the same position in you, and myriad resources to be as successful as you possibly can be. You'll hear this a million and one times but college will be one of the best parts of your life-embrace it. :)",

      "text": "First, please don't see yourself failing college. Please don't let your anxiety stop you from pursuing what you want to do. I believe you can do it, and if you find that pharmacy is not right for you, that's okay because you can still change majors.\nCollege courses aren't too bad imo. It depends on the professors so USE RATE MY PROFESSOR BRROOOOO IT HAS SAVED MEEE",

      "text": "To answer your question, they are harder but in different ways, and it also depends on the class. You will usually be taking fewer classes, but in return they will be more content-heavy and though you will likely not have much homework like you did in high school (some professors do assign homework, but most of them don\u2019t), you will have big exams, papers, and projects. This means you will have to spend more time studying and completing self-directed work than you did in high school. I\u2019m not trying to scare you, and I think you should absolutely give college a try before deciding you\u2019re a failure. If it\u2019s too stressful you can always take a gap year, start at community college, or start with a reduced course load.",
