  "title:": "Recommend me a major based on my interests",
  "text": "Hello! I'm a really indecisive person and I'm about to be applying to colleges in my home country and internationally. Since we have to decide on a major directly in our applications, it pretty much bums me out since I haven't tried a lot of stuff that might bave interested me so.... here's a list of my interests?\n\n\n1. I like chemistry except the bio and organic types. I've somehow self-studied for inorganic chemistry??? \n\n2. I like physics but probably only the solving part of it. I was never exposed to conceptual types of physics (lmao). I only know the ones that included maths so i kinda like those physics topics??? \n\n3. I can code a bit and I guess I'm good at maths\n\n4. Errr not sure how relevant this would be but I play Subnautica, Azur Lane, and Overwatch the most\n\nLately, I've been thinking of trying out engineering but I've never been exposed to the machine-aspect of things so I'm not sure how I would manage in engineering environments??? \n\nThank you in advance!!",

      "text": "Doesn't really matter what you *don't* like. You're gonna need to take the lame gen ed classes to get into your major classes anyway. \n\nComp sci is always a safe bet if you don't have any reservations about the math sequence. If you're in the US, I think ABET requires calc 1/2, linear algebra, statistics, (diffeq?), and calc-based physics 1/2. The rest is pretty fun.\n\nEdit: and some kind of discrete mathematics",
