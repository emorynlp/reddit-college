  "text": "\nHey, so I\u2019m trying to decide what to major in for college. I want a major that will get me a good job, and will have many different career paths. I want a degree that will get me good pay too. At least $65,000+. I know that might be hard to get, but I\u2019m willing to do it. I know the STEM careers are in demand, but I\u2019m not really good with STEM, except for the science field. Specifically biology. I want a degree that can pay well, but that I\u2019ll also enjoy, and will have a good job outcome.\n\nMy future plan is to become a lawyer. I\u2019m thinking about becoming a real estate, estates, educational, or mental health/disability/health lawyer. So, it may be useful to get a degree that ties into that. I do have a list of majors I\u2019m considering, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re good for what I\u2019m seeking. I like helping people, gaining knowledge, and challenging myself. I want a major that can lead to a respected career that can be high-achieving (that\u2019s hard to get with only a bachelor, I know). I\u2019m really interested in crime, history, law, politics, sociology, and psychology, but those aren\u2019t good degrees to pursue, so I\u2019m stuck.\n\nAny recommendations would be helpful. I want a degree that I can fall back on in case becoming a lawyer doesn\u2019t work out.",

I know someone suggested this but economics or statistics can be pretty well paying too.\n\nI saw that you don\u2019t like STEM except for bio so maybe something in health?",

At this point, I suppose all I can suggest for advice is starting off with something reachable and realistic until you work your way up in the field and get the job you\u2019re looking for. \nAs much as I don\u2019t recommend law school or going into politics because they are very unforgiving and relentless, if you think you can handle those fields and help yourself along the way, then I think you could definitely pursue either. \n\nAlternatively, to better narrow your interest; What do you want to do for people? How do you want to solve their problems? What is it that you want to go into those fields to get a better grasp on? What is  something you want to change?",

I could care less about the challenges they give, I love a good challenge.\n\nWell, I love fighting for people, and helping them. I like to make sure everyone gets the justice they deserve. For instance, I don\u2019t want to see a dad lose his kid when the mom is abusive and a terrible parent. In my opinion, that kind of case needs justice. I love fighting for my social issues. I\u2019d LOVE to be a legislator, but I\u2019d probably have to be elected, which I don\u2019t know about all of that.\n\nNow personally for educational law, I want to make sure kids are getting the education they deserve. I also wish the educations system was different, but I can\u2019t change that as a lawyer. For mental disorders/disabilities, I have a mental disorder, and that holds a place in my heart. I see a lot of people with mental disorders get misrepresented, or don\u2019t get  fair chances, and I want to make sure they do.\n\nThen real estate law just sounds like fun, honestly. I love house hunting, and helping people start a happy new life (yes, I know, I\u2019m making this seem better than it is). It\u2019s also a type of law that will always be needed, and that I will probably do good in as a lawyer.\n\nBeing a lawyer is my dream, but in case things go wrong, I need to make sure my backup plan is good too",

Don't major in something unviable like Poli Sci, find out you don't want to do law and are then stuck with a useless degree.\n\nAll you have stated is \"I want a high demand, well paying job\" which would entail some form of engineering, computer science, or Actuarial science. If you don't think you have what it takes for that then go into Accounting or nursing.\n\nOne thing that google searching \"I want to become a lawyer\" or  \"How much does a lawyer make\" doesn't tell you is that the big firms that give those stereotypical *large* lawyer salaries only hire from T14 law schools. It's not just about getting accepted into law school it's about getting accepted into the *right* law school. Going to a T50 or T100 law program will still cost upwards of over $100k in debt but won't qualify you for those large salaries and career growth opportunities. So, unless you can comfortably rely on getting into a top law program or somehow get a full ride at some lesser school then it can often times not be worth the amount of debt your would acquire.",

That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to pick a degree that\u2019s good to fall back on. As I said, I\u2019m not majoring in anything like Political Science because it\u2019s useless.\n\nHonestly, I just want a job I enjoy that\u2019s challenging, and pays well. I know I can accomplish that because I\u2019m a great student that\u2019s very well-rounded. I don\u2019t mind a challenge. I know most bachelor\u2019s don\u2019t give you much money without getting a graduate degree. But I\u2019m just trying to see what I can get out of it. I don\u2019t need to be a millionaire. I mostly just want a degree that can at least get me $70,000+ pay (middle class).\n\nAlso, I stated this in my post, I WOULDN\u2019T be good at STEM. STEM bores me in general, the only part of STEM that I\u2019d be good at is the science portion, specifically something like biology. When it comes to math, I can do algebra pretty well, and I can understand basic math. I was thinking about pursuing a finance/accounting degree, which works fine with law, BUT in the event I don\u2019t become a lawyer, then I mostly likely would become an accountant or something with finance.\n\nI already know off the bat that there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019d find my job boring. I may be good at it, but I sure as hell would hate it. Which I don\u2019t want.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m aware that law schools are expensive. That\u2019s NOT my main concern right now. I will definitely be figuring that out in the future, but my main concern right now is my major/backup plan. Also, I\u2019m aware of the fact law \u201csucks\u201d and it\u2019s not \u201cworth\u201dit. Personally, I get that, but it\u2019s not changing my mind or my passion. I\u2019m gonna work my butt off. Save up money as best as I can. I\u2019m a really good student. I love a challenge, and I\u2019m gonna attempt to do this. I would never go to a terrible law school in my life. I already have a law school in my mind. Thank you for making me aware, but this is what I want, it holds a place in my heart.",

This really depends on the prestige of your school, though, but a lot of people with Econ majors at my school ended up going into consulting or investment banking, both of which are very lucrative. Do some research into what kinds of companies recruit from your school, but I bet a lot of insurance companies and banks recruit Econ majors. It's also good because it has a lot of overlap with other fields, and a lot of people I know who majored in Econ did a joint major in Econ-political science, or studied history or sociology along with economics. The downside is that you do need to go to a school that gets recruited from (although I'm not sure about the specifics for this, since I did not hang around a lot of the Econ majors at my school), and it requires a decent amount of math, although most of this math is calculus, so nothing terribly advanced, but not easy either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may also be interested in computer science, which is a major that I'm studying, and I'm happy to answer any questions about that.",

In fact, at my school, the two most popular majors are Econ and computer science, and many of the Econ majors go on to work as analysts at JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs and earth 100k+ after a year or two of working. A lot also go into consulting, which is like giving advice to businesses about how to be more efficient and cut costs (or something like that, not many of my friends went into the field), and they can get paid similarly outrageous salaries. And I bet a bunch of other Econ majors at my school got jobs at insurance companies, project management jobs, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe downside is that these jobs are really competitive, and you have to network a lot and get high grades to get them. You also need to go to a target school to get these really lucrative jobs at top investment banks, but I'm sure that even if you don't go to a top school you can get finance jobs at banks or jobs at insurance companies with an Econ degree. I also wouldn't write off a double major, if I were you! I know a lot of people who double majored, the Econ majors normally double majored in political science, and my room mate majored in computer science and English. Double majoring is good if you schedule well, since it gives you a break from the other classes you're taking. So if you major in Econ and double major in something like English, you won't get burnt out by just taking Econ classes. Econ isn't an easy major, however. It's not as bad as like pure math, but there is a good amount of math in the degree. Econometrics, a mandatory class for Econ majors, is pretty much a statistics class. But it still is a very diverse degree, and I know people who majored in it who specialized their courses in the history or politics surrounding economics, which actually seems very intriguing to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I know you nixed it, but have you tried computer science classes at all? You might like it if you haven't! lol",

I don\u2019t want to brag, or anything. I don\u2019t like doing that, but I believe I can do it. \n\nThe problem is, I can do basic math, and well. But is it gonna bore me? I\u2019m probably gonna have to say yes. There were some math lessons that I liked, but after a week, I was so done with it. Imagine me doing that for the rest of my life.

For some reason, finance jobs hire people with Econ majors even though economics has like nothing to do with what the job is (weird, I know). And yeah, sociology, psychology, politics, and history don't have the best job outlooks, and that can be disappointing to someone who finds them interesting. But this reminds me that most people actually don't get to do what they find interesting. Even the people who are interested in math and physics, and end up majoring in  engineering. Most engineers don't actually use that much math in their jobs, mainly they just focus on plugging numbers into spreadsheets and computer programs. In a way, sometimes I feel that the only people who actually get to study what they love are academics. Everyone else studies what they find interesting in college, and then they spend the rest of their lives applying a watered down version of that to whatever job they end up doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut at the same time, that kind of view can be overly pessimistic, and a lot of people end up enjoying their jobs. I think a lot of it can actually come down to outlook. You can study something maybe you didn't find to be the most interesting, and over time, you may find that the subject has grown on you a lot. in fact, that's kind of what happened to me, and I ended up majoring in a subject that I thought I never would have been interested in at the start of college, lo. IDK, sorry I can't really offer you any more advice, but these kinds of questions can be very hard. And there's always the option of actually studying those subjects you mentioned - history, politics, psychology,  sociology - it just depends on how passionate you are. Going to law school or med school or grad school isn't a bad decision if you know you want to dedicate your life to one of those subjects.",

That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, and that\u2019s why I listed some of my interests. But the unfortunate thing is that most of the areas of interest I have don\u2019t lead to valuable career paths. Also, I\u2019m doing everything in my power to get a full-ride or tons of scholarships.\n\nI\u2019m a great student, and very well-rounded. I\u2019ll probably be a good candidate for a scholarship, and I do sports on top of that. So, there\u2019s always a chance that I get an athletic scholarship. I\u2019m also saving up money on top of that.\n\nI\u2019m just lost because accounting is a good degree, and I\u2019d be good at my job because it\u2019s basic math, which I do very well, but I would be bored to death. I just don\u2019t know a good major to fall back on because I LOATHE most STEM careers, unless it\u2019s a certain science. Also, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s a VERY competitive field due to its demand.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing my research, trying to see what I\u2019m good at. I\u2019m may be good with a certain type of business degree. But I have to be careful if I choose that. I\u2019ll totally look at the website you suggested. It\u2019s a shame that most of my interests don\u2019t lead to the greatest career paths, especially since I\u2019m a high achiever.",
