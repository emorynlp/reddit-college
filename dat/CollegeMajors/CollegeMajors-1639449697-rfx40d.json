  "text": "My H.S. junior son wants to be a surgeon.  Brains or bones, he says.  Neuro stuff or lumbar fusions...he watches them on Youtube.  Pls help me help him look at schools & their offerings(?)\n\nWeighted GPA 4.8, PSAT 1380.\n\nUpon graduation in 2023 he'll have:\n\n43 \\[AP\\] college credits (some schools accept all, some not)\n\nCompleted calc 2\n\nDual-enrollment in organic chem 1 & 2\n\nInterests are science, math, computer science (Java), robotics.  Has used a Da Vinci robot & fell in love.  A degree in BME seems to suit him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is all I know...\n\n1. I am old and recommend he get a B.S. in something science-related so he has a degree before med school.\n2. Redditors say a BME degree is a difficult path to get to med school; no social life, they don't use much of those skills later in career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis child will find his way, but I'd love some recommendations to gently nudge him towards.  A neuroscience degree?  Just take the premed courses at a great in-state school?\n\nWhat would you think fits his interests \\[above\\] & be the best bang for the buck to get to med school and/or let him discover that med school isn't the right fit after all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTIA!",

      "text": "Go BME and do a dual PhD/MD program like [this one](https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/tracks/biomedical-engineering-and-physiology/)\n\nAlternatively he could go BME and get out with a useful bachelor's degree, or he could go for an MD and become a doctor or he could even go for grad school. One thing I will say about pre-med degrees and medical school applications is that physics, engineering, chem and Biochem tend to do better than biology or pre-med majors across the board. An engineering degree will help him do better in med school and also gives him the fallback of working on something he might actually enjoy as well. \n\nThe organic chemistry credits will help him with med school and depending on the BME program, he will be just shy of having his first two years done before entering college (physics, biology credits and BME major courses).",
