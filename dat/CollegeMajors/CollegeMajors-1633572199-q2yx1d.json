Most of my other coworkers and I also have \u201cuseless\u201d degrees (I was an English major), and we\u2019re doing just fine.\n\nYou can get a decent job with any major if you get relevant experience and build job-related skills outside of class (which often you need to do for \u201cpractical\u201d majors, too). Employers care most about career-related internships, being involved in skill-building extracurriculars like your student newspaper, and maybe taking an extra class or two in HTML/CSS and marketing if you\u2019re interested in digital marketing.\n\nIf you want a well-paying career that\u2019s more closely related to your psych coursework, you will probably have to go to grad school, but there are options there \u2014 industrial organizational psychologist, school counselor, clinical psychologist, etc. This article shows some options: \n[Psychology career options](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beyond-the-psychology-major/201606/14-career-options-psychology-majors)",
