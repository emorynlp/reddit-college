  "title:": "What BS Major should I go for at ASU?",
  "text": "Never posted before but whatever. I been putting off college for awhile because I honestly hate it but it's a necessity for me to put in my package for OTS. \n\nTo give a short background I have an Associates already in Computer Programming from MGCCC. I honestly don't remember jack shit as all my teachers didn't enjoy their jobs and had little interest in engaging my classes other than go google what you need for your code. After being in the military for 3 years I find that I enjoy working with people, managing people and their work areas. I just want to make the most out of my credits from my associates degree to minimize how many classes I have to take. \n\nThe majors I been looking into are MIS which I think ASU doesn't offer but they do offer CIS. I also looked at the Applied Science (Internet and Web Development) which sounds pretty close to what I did back at MGCCC. I honestly don't want to do math but if I have to I'll do it. I just rather do less math focus and more IT or Management focused. \n\nWhich brings me to another thought of just forgetting IT altogether and jumping on a Business Major. I just don't know how well that will work out for me. It just would feel like burning 5k just to say fuck it and go the business route. \n\nI just need some input to see if there are better options for someone like or if what I mentioned are good options and I just need the bite the bullet and work my math brain more?",

      "text": "That seems like a decent plan. I wouldn't stress the math stuff too much, especially if, as you said, you were more interested in the business side of software as opposed to the math/programming. I've heard people on reddit who have gotten MIS/CIS degrees, and it does seem in line with what you want. Unless finance/accounting or whatever seems more appealing to you, I would take the plunge.",

          "text": "Thank you! I feel like I should take the plunge just can't decide to start in Oct or next year in January. I felt like I could spend the extra time on Khan Academy and treehouse to help out my math and programming. At the same time that's 4 months later that I could have knocked out 3-4 classes.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nDon\u2019t undervalue the IT background! Most people don\u2019t remember their education, google exists. If you\u2019re interested in business as well look into auditing, IT auditing positions. The application pool is low and if you\u2019re willing to get certifications they pay well! They cost much less then degrees. \nI received my bachelors degree in accounting and hated my job prospects because I missed interacting with people. My auditing roll is a perfect combination of both. IT auditors make more money and every big company is currently hiring. Work 40-50 hours make a good living. Good luck!",
