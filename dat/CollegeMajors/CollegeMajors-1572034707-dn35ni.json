  "text": "Hey I\u2019m a senior in high school filling out my college apps and I don\u2019t really know what to major in. I want something that can make me a decent amount of money. Some things I\u2019m thinking about are business, finance, or sports medicine. I also have a passion for cooking and I am also thinking of going to culinary school but I am scared that I will not be making enough money.",

      "text": "I wouldn't go to culinary school. You're right, you won't make enough $$$ to offset the amount of debt they charge you to cook food(which you can teach yourself for free). Chefs can work their way up from a restaurant chain without school.\n\nI recommend finance (accounting) or actuarial science too. For sports medicine, you'll likely need to go to med school after college and specialize in sports medicine thru certain IM, PM&R, EM, Orthopedic or Anesthesiology Residency programs, if that's what you mean. If you do go into medicine, you can major in literally anything, just complete the pre-requisites for med school.",
