  "text": "This toxic bish on the reddit literally told me that \"oh you are studying design in college? It's not a rocket science or stem major so that means you must be not intelligent! \" some people need to just shut the fuck up. Just becuase you are studying a certain subject does not make you any less smarter than other majors. Creativity and genius go hand in hand and design has its own decipline and reuqires level of altitude and skills to become expert. Term Genius still applies to artists and designers becuase have you heard of  vincent van gogh and Steve  jobs? Design requires intelligent. this bish doesnt know what she is talking about just becuase shes a doctor and has been only stuck in hospital studying natural science and never got out of ER to see the real world. I hate people like this. Makes my stomach flipped and im so infuriated by this woman's ignorance and her stupid thought process that makes me just not want to pursue design anymore.",
