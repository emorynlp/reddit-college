  "text": "HELP PLEASE!\nI have no idea what I want to major in yet but I do know i want to be a STEM major. Cal Poly Pomona is close to home don\u2019t need to dorm and cheaper compared (less in debt) to the other options and easy to switch majors. UCR closer to home easy to switch majors. UCSD far from home very difficult to switch majors if it\u2019s an engineering or biological sciences which is STEM.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mml651)",

The company\u2019s lies have great offices. And hours are shorter. You could double major in something like finance or management and you wouldn\u2019t code as much.",

To switch majors to a capped major I would need to fill out applications and it\u2019s by lottery system which people say don\u2019t always plan to get into your desired capped major. so i\u2019m still kinda stuck and confused on where to go.",

Most people think that CS is only software engineering, it is not. That being said, don't do it if you aren't interested, but don't be afraid of just coding for the rest of your life. That's something you can do with a certificate, or a SE degree, but with a CS degree you have more options.",
