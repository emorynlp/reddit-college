  "text": "Hello! I am a rising high school seniour and I\u2019m currently in a dilemma of figuring out what majors have human biology, design, and engineering. I would like to prioritize biology. I have considered mechanical engineering and bioengineering; however, none of them feel right to me. Any suggestions at what I should look into?",

Some people say \u201ddo it because you will be able to study what you love\u201d but personally I wouldn\u2019t because in the end college is an investment and realistically you should look at job prospects and salaries. (Bio)medical engineering fits well with your interests and teaches useful skills.",
