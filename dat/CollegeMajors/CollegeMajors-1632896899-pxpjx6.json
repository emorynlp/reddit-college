  "text": "Is this a good idea? I\u2019m only enjoying half of the stuff I\u2019m currently learning and I enjoy coding. Im also much better at math computations than I am at memorizing words.\n\nIm enrolled in an intro to programming class and I\u2019ve been having a blast. The only obstacles are the process of swapping majors and my family (they think computer science makes no money and that it\u2019s too nerdy for me, kinda makes me mad that they don\u2019t listen when I tell them the opposite).",

I\u2019m personally interested in both, but if you\u2019re just looking for the money aspect CS is definitely your best bet.",

Look up a video on youtube for shane hummus where he talks about the best majors for money and stuff and psych is usually near the bottom and computer science near the top. Just make your family watch a video",

Software developers and plenty of other tech professionals regularly make 6-figure salaries. Psychology majors without a graduate degree tend to make more like $50K (often less) in jobs that may not be directly related to their studies, unless they find a way to get into marketing management or something along those lines.\n\nIf you enjoy computer science more anyway, that\u2019s a no brainer \u2014 go for it!",

Go for it! I'm still in high school but from the looks of it you won't regret it, and it will only take time for your family to realize.",

Psych jobs also often require a masters or PHD, which delays the time until you can get a job. There's a lot of good jobs in programming also, so I have no idea where your family is getting that idea, lol.",
