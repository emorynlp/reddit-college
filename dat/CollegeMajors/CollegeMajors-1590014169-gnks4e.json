      "text": "Your major should 100% be education. That major group often comes with a clear-cut pathway to certification, and they may even pay for your initial tests. Plus, you should learn about kids (and whether you like them lol). Do you have an age group you are interested in working with? \n\nSpanish would be an excellent minor to accompany your education degree. Also, depending on your location, your certification program may have a specific test oriented to ESL teaching.",

Or merely a bachelors with a TESL certificate? I\u2019m so confused with all the programs and certifications, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m better off getting a bachelors or just a tesl on my own!",

That might be something to speak to an advisor in the college you\u2019re attending about; they could help you discern what kind of program of study would best serve you.",
