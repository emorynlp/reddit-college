  "text": "I know that the title of this post sounds discouraging but I came here with the good news.\n\nThe thing about deciding the right major for you, put a lot of pressure. Really think about it, you just graduated from high school, you barely tasted the adult life and suddenly you have to rely on your small life experience to make a correct shot to your future.\n\nHave this awareness that you're still young and because of that you may have a lot of volunteering experience, but you still lack deep knowledge about yourself. \n\nAlso add into the mix this online studying times which creates studying a not so fulfilling process, NO MATTER what major you're in. That also creates self doubt in students about their chosen major. \n\nSo the best thing you can do NOW, is follow your interests, for real, if you're curious about certain things, why not dedicating some time to go deep, you want to learn a new skill just because you feel like it, why not. \n\nReally get so organized and disciplined in a way that you are consistently invest your free time into the things that interests you the most, so when you graduate you'll have a lot more things you tried which will give you a WAY WAY better understanding of what to do next in your life. \n\nOf course many people will say that keeping discipline and having free time is difficult these days, which is another topic for another post. If you're really serious about your life and your upcoming future you should be ready to use your time wisely.  \n\n\n\ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc32\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e'\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d?",
