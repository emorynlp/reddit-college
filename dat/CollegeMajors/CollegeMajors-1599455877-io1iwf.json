  "text": "Hey everyone! I\u2019m a new sophomore bio major in community college and transferring fall 2021 to Either CSU or UC. I just dropped my molecular cell biology class because it was impossible for me to continue the class since it was very hard and I simply didn\u2019t enjoy it at all. I\u2019m thinking of changing my major and when I google majors it\u2019s always engineering, finance. I\u2019m okay in math and I feel like I can be better if I try my hardest. I\u2019m currently draining mentally because of pandemic, pressure of life and work, and classes, apply to colleges. Can you guys please please tell me a career that would pay 70k-90k a year. I am a hard worker. It\u2019s been 3 years that I live in America and I went from working in subway to being a medical interpreter making 20$ an hour. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing my research for college majors and careers and I\u2019m totally lost. I would love to read you guys major and career plans. \n\nI live in Sacramento California, so I would need a career that\u2019s better for CA. Thank you so much",

      "text": "That's a very difficult question because it's soooo subjective, it's based a lot on your passions. The thing is, once you have a useful degree most jobs won't care exactly which one it is unless you're literally following the path ie. Medicine -> doctor or Engineering-> engineer. I am doing a astrophysics degree, unless I actually wanted to be a research scientist there isn't many things that directly follow on from this. As it happens I want to be a pilot so it doesn't really matter but they don't care what degree you have. So it's more important to pick something you enjoy rather than something that is going to make you this amount of money in the future. By all means if you love engineering go for it but I was planning to do that degree until I read the syllabus, just not something I wanted to get into.",

          "text": "Thank you so much for the advise, I\u2019m definitely not doing engineering. I\u2019m in a path for dentistry to become a dentist and it\u2019s just so much you have to do to get there. My main problem is that I don\u2019t know what to major in, and I\u2019m struggling to find a way out. What do you think of doing economics and minor in banking management?",

              "text": "I'd say if you enjoy economics it's could be a very useful degree, but you have to make sure you want to do it more than the one you gave up. Really read into what you will be studying and the subject areas and decide if that is the direction you want to take. There are an abundance of well payed jobs you would be eligible for with that degree as well as many more that are not specific with which degree they want. But also make sure there are jobs available that you would be interested in. (I don't fully understand the major minor system in the US here in the UK we just do a degree in one specific subject but I'm assuming the majority of your degree will be in this subject.)",

      "text": "Only fields really worth going into by getting a degree in my opinion are the following:\n\nTech field; Think of degrees like: Information Technology, Computer Science etc.\n\nBusiness field; For business as long as you specialize in something you should be fine, just don\u2019t get a general business degree as that is too vague.\n\nEngineering; almost all engineering degrees are nice, although civil engineering is getting kinda saturated. But if you like it, go for it.\n\nHealth; People with medical knowledge are always gonna be in demand so this one is very solid as well. Me personally, I don\u2019t advise becoming a doctor, rather go for something like nurse practitioner or physician\u2019s assistant. They do very similar stuff, just without going into as much debt as doctors.\n\nLaw (if you do proper research); This one is tricky, I don\u2019t know much about going into law but I have heard you need to be careful but of course, that\u2019s hear say so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nAlso a math degree is tends to be pretty nice as well but I guess that fits in somewhere above.\n\nChoose a field you like that\u2019s listed above and you should be fine. If there isn\u2019t anything you like, I don\u2019t suggest going to college as you\u2019ll just rack up debt.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nEDIT: grammar",
