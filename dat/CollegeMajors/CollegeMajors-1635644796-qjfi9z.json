  "text": "Hello all, I am in the class of 2024, so thankfully I have enough time to think this through. I have 3 possible majors for myself:  \nElectrical Engineering  \nMathematics/Applied Mathematics  \nComputer Science\n\nI realize that computer science is more than just programming, I realize that there is a lot of theory as well - which I enjoy. I also enjoy Physics and Circuit Theory which is why I chose EE. Then, Math because I enjoy learning it in general.\n\nSo, my question is:  \nWhat major would present the most opportunities, and would be the best in terms of pay?",

      "text": "I agree with the other poster - it is probably a bit early to be deciding, especially when you've already narrowed it down to a pretty specific group of majors, IDK how much point there is in further rumination before you even get into college. I think there is enough overlap between these that you don't need to make a hard decision just yet. I know that electrical engineering and CS are of roughly similar pay, math is a bit more variable but a decent number of math majors go into software anyway, so it's more important what career path you choose instead of your major, in that case. CS overall probably has the most opportunities and the highest job growth in the foreseeable future. I would generally say that if you like programming, a degree in computer science or computer engineering or math-computer science (if you're also into algorithmic stuff) would be the best choice, otherwise electrical engineering or applied math.",

Some colleges will offer it as a dual major, but even in colleges where that isn't offered, a lot of students double major in both because there's a decent amount of overlap in required classes. Also consider computer engineering if you're interested in low level programming + electrical engineering.",
