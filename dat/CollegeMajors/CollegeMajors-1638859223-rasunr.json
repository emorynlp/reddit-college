  "text": "I'm a second year mechanical engineering major and so far I've hated every class I've taken that wasn't an engineering class itself. What should I do? I feel like I enjoy the engineering classes and find them interesting but I can't hold any attention for other classes I need",

I'm fine implementing the lessons and understanding them but I find them demotivating sometimes and haven't really enjoyed them at all, minus the actual engineering classes",

              "text": "As you get further along in your major, you'll end up taking fewer pre req classes. My friends who were in engineering also had to take a bunch of general requirements their freshman/sophomore years that didn't have much to do with engineering (chem, econ, writing classes, language, etc). But calc and physics are the foundation of engineering, so you should be making sure you get good at those.",
