  "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nI\u2019m a sophomore in need of declaring a major this next semester and I am having difficulty choosing what to do. Many people have told me that major\u2019s don\u2019t necessarily matter etc... Nonetheless, I am debating if I should double major in Behavioral Decision Sciences and Econimics or if I should do an Applied Math-Economics major. I\u2019m thinking of doing an MBA or some masters in industrial management or finance and working in either business consulting or finance or anything within those two fields in the near future. Which route should I go? \n\nThanks in advance for any input!",
