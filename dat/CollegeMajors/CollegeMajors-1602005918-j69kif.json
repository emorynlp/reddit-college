  "title:": "(17F) First Gen senior torn between CompSci/Polisci/Neuroscience",
  "text": "Hi guys! I have always like STEM, I really like technology, engineering and math. As a first gen, for my family it\u2019s important for me to make sure I have good job availability. I know computer science and stem are great majors and more recently, from 8-12 grade I\u2019ve had a political awakening, which is why I want to get in Political Science. I used to want to study Criminology but :/. Lastly the Neuroscience, I really enjoyed reading about the brain in my physiology class and I\u2019m in ap psych right now. Can anyone help me choose what to do??",

      "text": "I ask everyone here this same question, but do you plan on going to grad school? \n\nFields like neuroscience and political science often require an advanced degree, so I would start thinking about that and if it\u2019s something you are interested in pursuing. Don\u2019t get too caught up on it, but google \u201cdegree requirement for X job\u201d before you pick your major. I learned this the hard way. \n\nComputer science is a great major if you are interested in it! There are many subfields within it, and even some overlaps with neuroscience (AI, machine learning, natural language processing, etc).",
