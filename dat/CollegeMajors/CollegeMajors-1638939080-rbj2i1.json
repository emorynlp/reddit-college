      "text": "If you\u2019re just concerned about those three things, marketing is a safer bet. Psychology majors who don\u2019t go on to grad school sometimes end up in marketing as well (I know a couple who did), but it\u2019s a less direct route. You probably won\u2019t find a job that\u2019s super closely related to psychology with just a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2014 you usually need a graduate degree for that.\n\nRegardless of which one you study, do at least one marketing internship. Can\u2019t emphasize this enough. Employers will care more about the hands-on experience you gained from the internship than about what you majored in, and it\u2019s really hard to compete for an \u201centry level\u201d job without one.",
