  "text": "Hello! This year I\u2019m a senior in high school. I\u2019m going to be going into college next year. I am wondering if I should get a major in astrophysics. I really enjoy learning about new space discoveries and would love to be making these discoveries one day, but I do not know if it\u2019s hard to get a job as an astrophysicists. I really want my college degree to be one that has lots of jobs opportunities, so that I always have a job opportunity if the economy is not doing well. \n\nSo I thought of a few things: \n\n1) Should I major in an engineering degree like aeronautical or aerospace engineering, minor in astrophysics, and go for a PhD in astrophysics? \n\n2) Can I double major in aerospace engineering and astrophysics, and then go for a PhD in astrophysics? \n\n3) Should I major in aeronautical/aerospace engineering and go for a PhD in astrophysics? \n\nHelpful Information: \n\n-I applied to Michigan and MSU (accepted into MSU. Idk about U of M yet) \n\n-Also applied to Yale, Princeton, and Rice through Questbridge. I\u2019m a questbridge finalist. I find out my acceptance on Dec 2. \n\n-I job shadowed a planetary scientist at MIT. I absolutely loved it. The guy I researched was doing his PhD on magnetic fields on rocks, meteorites, and lunar samples.",

      "text": "I would major in a normal Physics major. Normal physics is a lot more broad, and you\u2019ll be able to see the other sides of physics than Astrophysics. After four years you might be super interested with experimental physics or Theoretical physics or some other branch. Don\u2019t limit yourself in a field where you need post graduate education anyway. I would get a BS in Physics, get really good grades, then find a school to go from BS to PHD",
