  "text": "\nDue to a sudden staff change, one of the classes I was meant to be taking for my freshman fall term is no longer available to me without a scheduling conflict. So,  my university gave me a list of classes I could be taking with my schedule instead and one of them is an intermediate Japanese class (I'm not sure how the boundaries for these classes are defined but it uses  Genki 2 as its main textbook).  I wanted to research the class before making my decision.\n\nMy experience with Japanese before this has mainly been self studying for the JLPT (I intended to take the N3 this summer but it was cancelled due to covid). \n\nA lot of math classes in American universities  tend to be relatively similiar  and many share their exams / Homework assignments publicly.  I am not sure if this is the case with language classes , but if so could someone point me to any examples of what examinations at a university level look like for intermediate Japanese?",
