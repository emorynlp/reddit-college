  "text": "I'm currently a sophomore student majoring in CS. After my first couple terms, I've concluded CS isn't for me. I was always hesitant going into CS, looking into Data Science, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Science Technology Society, etc. I have no interest in learning to code nevermind working in a job in software development. \n\nI should also say I haven't been a fan of Calculus/ Math as well. Took Calc 1 and 2, but had to drop Calc 3 because I had zero clue what I was doing. \n\nMy university offers \"Data Science\", \"Economics and Data Science\", and \"Computing and Security Technology\" degrees which interest me. I've also recently been considering teaching as a possibility, maybe even CS teaching. \n\nI found some interest in CogSci and Science, Technology, and Society degrees as well, but my school doesn't offer those as majors and I'm uncertain as to where those degrees would lead me. \n\nShould I switch to Economics and Data Science or Computing and Security Technology? Or are both of these degrees going to lead me to struggling to find a well paying job.",

      "text": "I don't think any of your major choices (Except maybe psych but you're looking at the better side of it with CogSci) have any career issues. I'd guess there's some gen-ed psych and stat courses that all of them require, I'd look at taking them and seeing where you land on enjoying them.\n\nAs a Data science major, it's got a decent bit of math but it's mainly stats, so struggling with calc shouldn't preclude you from it\n\nIt doesn't look like you're straying too far from your current major, all of what you're looking at has a programming element to it. This means you've got room to play around without too much lost ground, you've probably got the same gen-ed requirements throughout that you've taken.\n\nI'd be tempted to take those entry-level psych and stats (And the intro data course) and just see what you'd like to move forward with (Psych and Data science could be a good combination)",

          "text": "That's pretty much my plan for the next term. I'm a little concerned about how extensive data science will be, which is part of the reason I'm intrigued by our new economics and data science degree, which is basically half data science and half economics. And pretty much all the classes I've taken so far would apply for whatever I end of majoring in. It's just now is when that changes and I have to make some decisions or get screwed if I change my major.",
