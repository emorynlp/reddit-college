I was interested in psychiatrist but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m interested in medicine anymore. I did take a liking to architecture for a while but I\u2019m not sure.",

      "text": "I honestly don't think clinical psychologists do as much math as you think (mainly statistics). Architecture is definitely more of a civil engineering thing, which also involves a lot of math and maybe some statistics. So if you're thinking about architecture but still want to use math frequently, civil engineering is a good idea. If you're solely interested in a career based off its usage of math and/or stats, I would go with any field of engineering.",

I don\u2019t mean to diminish your reply at all, I just want to clarify the discrepancies between OP\u2019s conception about architecture and my own experience with the subject. Completely agree that civil engineering would be a better fit for someone more stem-oriented.",
