I would say evaluate your skill in both and go for what you believe you're weaker in or if possible to do both then consider a double major. \n\nI do want to caution you that you have a very specific plan and timeframe laid out and most of the times what happens almost never aligns with those plans or time frames",

I\u2019m also thinking of minoring in Management and Communication or Theatre arts.\n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s easier for someone to learn how to produce music on platforms such as YouTube compared to learning industry fundamentals plus having connections with professionals.\n\nYeah, life does find a way to mess up your plans but maybe that\u2019s for the best. Either way, if the pop group doesn\u2019t come into fruition in the course of my college years. I could always look into producing and managing for soloists including myself.",

Many parents will mean will and try their best but they may not have a full grasp of the breadth of what is being discussed. Consider what they are saying and use it as a data point to make your decision. \n\nYou don't need to have your life figured out, just keep a general direction of where you want to go.",
