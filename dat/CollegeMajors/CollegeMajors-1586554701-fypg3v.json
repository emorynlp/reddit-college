  "text": "To make my schedule work in my last year of my mathematics degree, I may need to make the switch even though I don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s simply the way my classes line up that can\u2019t be switched around. So what\u2019s the drawback? Graduate school look down on it?",

      "text": "There\u2019s really no drawback usually. BA versus BS is just semantics a lot of times. For example, my school offers a BA and BS in Biology. They\u2019re both under the same school and require the exact same classes, apart from a two year second language requirement in the BA. So in fact, the BA is more difficult just from that requirement, but only slightly. My major is the same way, I simply went with the BA for freedom in my minor and to improve my Spanish. Some colleges only offer a BA and others only offer a BS. Most colleges offer a mix of things, but at the end of the day as long as the classes fulfill what you need, it doesn\u2019t matter if it says Arts or Science. \n\nNow, there are some minute drawbacks. If you want to be a science or math teacher in K-12 in some states, they only allow people with a BS. Along with that, someone who doesn\u2019t know any better may think a BA somehow means you slacked off for 4 years. There may be more differences, but truly, at the end of the day it shouldn\u2019t matter. Graduate schools will know better than to scoff at a BA as long as the coursework lines up with what they require.",

              "text": "From what I can figure, all you need is a [bachelor degree of some sort](https://www.teachercertificationdegrees.com/certification/north-carolina-alternative/) sort in order to eligible for the program. The degree just has to have at least 24 credits in a teachable subject. I couldn\u2019t find anything that specified a science degree. You could call the main office for the lateral entry program and ask them about that just to be sure too!",
