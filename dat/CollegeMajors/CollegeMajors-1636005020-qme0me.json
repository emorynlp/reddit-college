  "title:": "\"Why Major\" Statement -- Struggling",
  "text": "I guess this fits similarly to a \"is this the right major for me\" question.\n\nFor my intended major, I have to apply to the professional school that offers it. Part of the application requires writing a personal statement; why do I want to major in environmental health science?\n\nI love studying human health. I don't like working in a patient-doctor personal relationship type thing. I want to research. I love the environment. Yet I don't know how to put this in a cohesive.. statement. I feel \"studying how we affect the environment and how that affects us excites me\" isn't enough.\n\nThis is making me question if this is the right major for me. The content gets me so excited, but I can't explain why. I don't know how else to convey to people my excitement other than telling them about the exciting things I learn.\n\nThank you to whoever reads and replies to this. It's greatly appreciated.",
