  "title:": "Everything I did from my first line of code up until my first internship during my 1st year of CS degree.",
  "text": " If there's anyone who would like to hear a different perspective, here is mine.\n\nBefore going into CS, I was scared if I could do it. A year and a half later, I truly think it was one of the best decisions I ever made and that this is one of the best career paths one could go in today!\n\nIf you're someone like me before having doubts but is also intrigued, I highly encourage it! CS isn't an easy field but it isn't impossible either like many make it out to be. It's incredibly rewarding with endless career opportunities waiting for you. \n\nHere's my first year of CS in 5 mins!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwT6gGMRr9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwT6gGMRr9s)",
