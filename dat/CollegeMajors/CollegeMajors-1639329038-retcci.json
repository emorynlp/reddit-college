  "text": "Hey ya\u2019ll,\n\nSo I\u2019m a freshmen attending university to persuade in dentistry but I don\u2019t really like it (my parents and relatives made me major in it) and I\u2019m having a hard time keeping up with my Calc and Bio classes. I was going to wait it out and see if I would end up liking it but 3 months of having mental breakdowns and being afraid I might not be cut out for this made me realize I won\u2019t like it even after my science years are over. I\u2019m super passionate about art (digital drawing, traditional drawing, etc.) and anything related to games, programming, coding, etc. so I was wondering what kind of majors would suit me best? I need one that would give me job offers that would help me in the future and keep me from having to worry about money problems.",

      "text": "I second digital design, but not computer science. Comp Sci is just digital math. I would also recommend looking into Gnomon School of Visual Effects and other similar schools (just naming the one I know). You could also go for an animation degree at a university, most state schools offer one.",
