First I'll give some info about myself and then what I've thought of, but I'm open to suggestions too. \n\nIm the speech and debate captain. \n\nI'm an Future Business Leader of America Officer\n\nI'm a DECA Officer. \n\nThose are my three main clubs/interests. I also play sports and am in a lot of other clubs but those are my main ones. \n\n\nIve thought about law school but high unemployment rate and high burnout. \n\n\nI'm interested in business and government and maybe being a politician. \n\n\nSo far I've thought of these majors, please provide more to consider or help me root out a few.  \n\n\nBusiness, mainly business Management\n\n\nPoli Sci\n\n\nGovernment and Policy\n\n\nPyschology.
