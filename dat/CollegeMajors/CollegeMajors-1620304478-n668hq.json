  "text": "I am currently an EMT (3 years), getting ready to go back to school. Originally I was set on nursing school, but recently wind turbine technologies has peaked my interest. Both similar lengths of school, both similar entry pay in my area. Job outlook on both seems decent here as well. I am interested in healthcare as I feel I\u2019m decent at it. Also very intrigued by green energy and working outside. Any suggestions or is this just a preference thing?",

      "text": "If you're already an EMT for three years I think you should just stick to nursing. You already have work experience and a higher level of understanding of how the medical emergency room works. I know some friends who work as EMT and went back to school to pursue a bachelors in nursing simply because EMT doesn't pay well. Also, I don't really see a correlation between EMT and a wind turbine technician, so if you go back to school you might need to take some extra electrician pre reqs.  If you're interested in wind turbines you should first borrow some books and delve into that field before committing. It's your choice but I think you have an advantage in nursing.",
