  "title:": "Picking between a few majors/ Indecisive high school grad who can't make up their mind.",
  "text": " Hello,  \nI've struggled for pretty much the past four years of my high school life with trying to find a major. I've met people who knew what they wanted to be from an extremely young age, yet I have always jumped from one major to another or multiple majors to no major in terms of what I wanted to major in at that time. I went from developing lists of every interest I have had that could applied to a career. I've managed with much distress and excessive amounts of time thinking about such things to shorten my listen down to pretty much A major or a selection of them\u00a0or majors of the same type. Or essentially I have become stuck on either majoring in History (Haven't yet picked a focus) hopefully going on to get my PhD in that subject OR my second option(s) being Engineering (Although I have thought of just majoring in Physics), I've yet to pick a specific type of engineering but since I've always had an interest in Physics I've been leaning to majors with more physics that interest me. So essentially Electrical,Mechanical,Civil,Aerospace. My only issue is just this I fear if I major in one of my passions say such as History I will regret not majoring in a STEM option. The logical choice to solve this would be to just major in one of my engineering choices or just physics and then keep history as a rather keen hobby of mine. However then that brings up the slight issue of personal doubt and rather shoddy skill in regards of mathematics that and the fact I would be robbed of potential interest and passion in the study of history I could further meet with a degree. My fear being that since I had a rather troubled past with Math in school I do not think I could handle the math classes that would be required to major in Engineering or Physics. The question from that would be really, Do I take a rather large risk and go for engineering which could result in my failing out due to being unable to understand and learn the math required (Not for a lack of effort as my issues with math have come largely from lacking earlier knowledge of it as a result of not caring about my earlier education, However I have worked extremely hard to fix this issue with extreme amounts of my free time being put towards studying math.). Or do I just go for the second option being majoring in one of my longest loved interests I have had, History. On one hand I've always liked and somewhat excelled in Science albeit when it came to physics I did struggle with the calculus aspect of the work. On the other I fear of possible regrets I would have from not making the leap and at very least attempting to major in Engineering.  \nAny advice is greatly appreciated. ",

      "text": "I understand some of your anxiety about this. It kind of reminds me of how I saw my brother pretty much know since middle school what he wanted to do, and it took me until halfway through my own college experience to figure out what kind of subject I actually wanted to study. So yes, there are people out there who know exactly what they want to do, but that's definitely not the case for most people who go into college. And in fact, I think you're in fine shape for thinking about what you want to major in, so please don't stress! lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you definitely have a lot of diversity in your possible majors, which is very good because it means that you have a lot of different interests that you might want to explore. So let's start with history, although I think you can already kind of guess what I'm about to say. So yeah, a history major generally doesn't have the greatest job market compared to engineering, but there are still a ton of jobs where the ability to write, research, and analyze is very important. You could get your. masters and become an archivist/librarian, history majors sometimes go into journalism, teaching (obviously), as well as various business positions such as HR and marketing. The thing is, though, if you do get a history degree, you're definitely going to have to be on top of your shit in regards to finding a job and getting extracurriculars. Not the exact same thing, but I knew people who wanted to go into journalism and these people were running themselves ragged doing extracurriculars, writing for their school newspaper, applying for internships, networking, etc. So if you do want to major in history and do something along those lines (business, journalism, writing, sales, etc.), make sure you figure out you want to go down that path ASAP and then start busting your ass as hard as you can, since a lot of those positions are very competitive. This raises the question as well: what kind of job do you want? You're focusing on what you want to major in, which is definitely important, but the job you want to have is more important, in some cases. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then you mentioned the possibility of getting your PHD in history. So I'm just going to say  that getting a PHD is a very big undertaking, and it's not something you should do on a whim. My brother, for example, pretty much knew he wanted to get his PHD since he was like a freshie in high school, lol. And history in particular is very competitive, and it's extremely difficult to get a tenured position at a university in history. So if you want to get a phd in history, make sure that your heart is completely in it. But to be honest, I don't really recommend it unless you know for a fact you wouldn't be happy doing anything else. It's unfortunate, but academia for humanities has become so damn competitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo then there's the choice between physics and engineering. So yeah, you said you find physics interesting, but struggle with the math. In which case, majoring in pure physics might be quite difficult, since there is a TON of math in a pure physics major. And TBH, majoring in physics I don't think is really worth it unless you're actually very good at physics. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a fantastic major for people who have that natural aptitude in physics and math, since it really develops your analytical skills, and finance/tech companies love physics majors, but I would only really recommend that if you're already very good at math and physics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it's not too personal of a question, can I ask how bad at math you are? Did you take any AP tests in it? What were your grades like? If you did at least average in your calc classes I would say that you could major in engineering. It would probably be a lot of work, and quite challenging at a lot of points, but by no means impossible if you're diligent and prepared. Civil engineering tends to have the reputation for being the \"easiest\" engineering degree (it doesn't require as much math as electrical engineering from my understanding), and it has good job placement (unlike environmental: don't quote me on this, but I've heard environmental has lower employment than most engineering disciplines). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I obviously don't know you personally, or your exact interests, which makes giving a straight up recommendation very difficult, but I'll just reiterate what I've been alluding to, which is that a history major is not as safe as an engineering major, but you can still get jobs in a lot of fields if you're motivated. Engineering is safer and higher paying (generally), but you might not find it as interesting and it's harder. But another thing to consider is that the jobs I listed for a history degree don't have to do with history directly, but more the writing and analytical skills you get from a history major. So you could definitely get these jobs with another major, but also realize that you might not find these jobs interesting, since they don't have to do with history that much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition, since it seems like you have very broad interests, I'll provide some other possible majors you might find interesting:\n\n&#x200B;\n\ncomputer science - I'm actually a CS major myself, so ask me any questions you may have on this. Not a super easy major, but there's not as much math in it (generally) as in an engineering degree, and you can create a lot of cool projects with it. It can be very frustrating, though, and there's more stuff you need to do (interview prep, side projects, learning new frameworks/languages) than in other majors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbusiness - there are a lot of business jobs that maybe you would find interesting. Finance, accounting, MIS, IT, supply chain management are generally considered well paying degrees. IDK much about these, but they aren't as much math as engineering but still pay decent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso yeah, just some general advice. LMK if you have any questions or whatever.",
