  "title:": "Can't decide if I should change my major",
  "text": "I'm currently in a public health B.S. program with a literature minor (declared it at 2 am the other day). I really love my field, and I like feeling secure that there are many career paths I could go into with it that are both stable-ish and have a positive impact on the world. However, I just feel a joy in my lit classes that I've rarely if ever felt in my health classes. When I write papers for my lit class, I feel like I actually have a unique voice and way of thinking, and I leave my classes feeling inspired and motivated. My lit classes are usually harder/requiring more work, but I think this is mainly because I care so much more that I want to put in the time. I do care about my health classes, and I'm mainly in intro courses, so it's going to get more specific and hopefully interesting, but I don't feel like I have anything unique to contribute to the field in the ways my peers do. I also thought I wanted to be more involved in science/research \n\n I wonder if the reason I never let myself go into a humanities major is just fear of not having a degree that inherently leads to a career. I've been struggling a lot this semester, primarily with external mental health issues, to the point where I've thought about taking time off/dropping out, and I'm wondering if changing subjects would help make school more bearable. \n\nI'm a sophomore, so it feels a little late to change out of nowhere, so I'm thinking my best bet is to stay on my current track. My program hasn't given me much exposure to the intersections between these fields (medical humanities etc), but I'm really interested in this, so I can try to carve out those opportunities for myself. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has thoughts on this, or like a general framework to think about changing your major without it being an impulsive or emotional decision. Also, job prospects for lit majors? I like the idea of staying in academia but I don't want that to be my only option.",

      "text": "Can you double major in lit and public health? \n\nIf not, research the kinds of jobs people with each degree to typically get and decide what you prefer and are comfortable with. Then you can make an informed decision and choose the path you\u2019re most passionate and excited about, whether that\u2019s public health or literature. Education is about far more than just job prospects, but you still need to consider where you want to go after you graduate.\n\nIf you want to work in content marketing, communications, public relations, or tech writing, English/literature is a good major \u2014 just make sure you do a career-related internship before you graduate. If you don\u2019t, or if you would prefer a job that lets you more directly impact people\u2019s health, you\u2019re probably better off majoring in public health and taking as many literature courses as you can on the aide.\n\nJob prospects for literature majors are better than a lot of people think, especially if you do an internship before you graduate and build some extra job-related skills (like HTML/CSS, Photoshop, and social media marketing experience.) A lot of employers list English as a desirable major for content marketing, copywriting, UX writing, and tech writing jobs. We all know a few underemployed liberal arts majors, but these are usually the people who did little to no career planning and didn\u2019t do any internships before they graduated. \n\nYou can turn any major into a decent job if you find a way to build the right skills and experience. You can also end up underemployed with any major if you don\u2019t do enough career planning/prep. I know a few STEM majors who wrongly assumed their degrees alone would be enough and struggled more after graduation than most of their liberal arts peers.\n\nI was an English major, and I ended up in content marketing after graduation. I got the job because I had done a 10 hr/week marketing communications internship at a nonprofit for a few months (for college credit \u2014 I did this in place of an elective course while also having a paid job), had some writing samples from my student newspaper, and had a connection I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d made through that newspaper. I never would have gotten up the courage to switch to English if I hadn\u2019t burned out on STEM first and realized I didn\u2019t want a job in engineering after all. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s how you feel about public health, but FWIW, I don\u2019t regret my major at all. Studying what I was passionate about opened a lot of doors for me and helped me find better communities and friends.\n\nTL;DR Look up statistics about English/literature major job outcomes and see how you feel about them. If you\u2019re OK with them and willing to put in some extra work to build your resume before you graduate, go for it!",

      "text": "Pretend that you have a literature degree already and start looking for jobs. Don't apply for any, just look at jobs boards as though you were currently job hunting. \n\nNow pretend that you have a public health degree already and are looking for jobs. \n\nHow do you feel about each situation?\n\nI don't mean this in a rhetorical way; my point isn't \"you should major only in public health and not in literature.\" I just mean explore both options as though you are job hunting right now and see what it's like. Maybe you'll see more literature-adjacent jobs than you expected. Maybe you'll see none. Maybe you'll see some jobs you'd be qualified for with a literature degree, but no jobs you'd actually want to do. Instead of worrying about the potential future problem of the job market, pretend you have to deal with this problem right now and not in a few years. If you feel like this isn't a problem you'd want to deal with right now, you probably won't want to deal with it in a few years either. \n\nAlso, try asking the literature and public health academic advisors if they have any information on what jobs their alums are doing now. \n\nFWIW, I have an \"unemployable\" degree and have never regretted it, but a) I was lucky enough to not have any loans/debt, and b) I've never had a post-graduation job directly related to my degree. I would never advise anyone to major in something they hate, but it doesn't actually sound like you hate public health.",
