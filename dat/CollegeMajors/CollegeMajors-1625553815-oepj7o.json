      "text": "Yes. Your major and your experience in college will definitely help you gain these skills. Remember this is why you go to college. They teach you the skills needed for whatever major you want to go into. Nurses aren't born knowing everything about nursing. They are taught. Even personality skills are gained through your experience at university and through your major. Communication is a skill that you will need for any and every job. And trust me, in college you will do more than your fair share of communicating. As you start learning more about your finance major and experience more things in college, you will grow as a person and prepare yourself for your future career.",
