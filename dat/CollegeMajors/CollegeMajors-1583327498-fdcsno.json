      "text": "Anthropology can be an employable degree depending on which of the four subfields you focus on. For example, there are more opportunities for employment directly in the field with archaeology and biological anthropology than there are in cultural and linguistic anthropology at the bachelors level. Are you going to focus on one of those areas or are you going to more general for your bachelors? Also, do you want to work as an anthropologist or just study it?",

              "text": "I take it you\u2019re outside the US? Sociocultural/Cultural Anthropology is a little more difficult to translate to the career world. However, that\u2019s not my specialty, so that could be just a bias of mine. I\u2019d wager that because of the skills you\u2019ll pick up in anthropology in general, as well as in your focus area, you\u2019d be quite equipped for any career that requires you to mediate between \npeople, such as Human Resources. Really, any job that puts you in direct contact with people from varying backgrounds would benefit from one having a degree in Anthropology, which are practically all careers. You\u2019d also pick up plenty of interview and research skills within your focus area, so you could combine that with your minor to really delve into market research for companies or even journalism entirely. Do you have any plans of what career you specifically want?",

Social work would benefit from an anthropology degree, as again, you\u2019d be interacting directly with people from different backgrounds. However, some colleges do offer social work degrees if that\u2019s the route you are considering.",
