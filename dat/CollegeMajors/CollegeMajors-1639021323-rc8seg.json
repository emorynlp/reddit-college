  "text": "I plan on studying Child Development at CSU Dominguez Hills after community college. I want to go further than my bachelors but I don\u2019t know what options are available for child development students, as in I have no idea what different masters programs Child dev bachelors students can go for. What are some good masters degrees that child development majors can go into? Preferably offered in California. Thanks in advance!",
