  "text": "So I'm really interested in environmental conservation, but I tend to lean less on oceanography or like the earth Sciences and more on the designing eco-friendly products side.\nMost colleges I've searched offer either Env'tal studies or science which I find great (and most likely gonna pursue one of those) but I don't know if they could help me get knowledge on how to design those said eco-friendly products. Any recommendations on which undergraduate program/courses to take?",

      "text": "That would be more the realm of engineering or design than environmental science. There is some design that goes on in forestry though, in forest products research, but that is usually a hodgepodge of majors (like chem, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, etc.). \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is to not limit yourself to just something that has \u201cenvironmental\u201d in its name",

          "text": "Thanks a lot. I did do some research on Industrial and Product Design and I love the major too. The only problem is those colleges usually don't have a good env'tal science program or they don't have it at all. Is there a way I can still get to my career-ish goal without the industrial and Product design courses?",

              "text": "Honestly it would be the other way around. If you want to design stuff an ES degree won\u2019t help other than giving the knowledge of what the problem is. \n\nThe design side would be how to fix it, they are just different sides of the same issue. The people who devote the time to find the issues don\u2019t have the time to develop solutions and the people developing solutions rely on them to find the issues. It is a pretty good symbiotic system, but only when there is mutual support. \n\nShort term I would suggest focusing on one or the other. Looping the other in with a graduate degree would be the best way probably.",
