  "text": "I am a senior in high school and I have found a love for graphic design and I\u2019m really good at it. But\u2026 I also love statistics and think it\u2019s a good backup. I have heard about double majors and I think I want to do that. Is it possible to major in both graphic design and statistics? It\u2019s a weird combo but I think it would make me really happy. Thoughts?",

Weird combos are actually great \u2014 they let you develop multiple skills and ways of thinking. \n\nAlso, those sound like they would compliment each other in more ways than you might think. You\u2019d be the absolute best at infographics, be a better candidate for marketing and UX jobs that require both data skills and creativity, and be able to create amazing presentations and other visuals about data. You\u2019re getting data skills and the design skills to communicate the data. There are probably all sorts of interesting ways to combine those skillsets I haven\u2019t thought about.",
