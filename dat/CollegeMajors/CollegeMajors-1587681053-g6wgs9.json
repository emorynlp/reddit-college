  "text": "Im currently a sophomore in high school, so i know have a decent amount of time before i have to make the decision of what i want to do, but i really want to love what i end up pursuing. I've been considering a lot of jobs, such as nursing, being a vet, marine biology/zoology, neuroscience, criminology, even marketing/business/communications. Before i was really into criminal justice and really wanted to major in that, but i just dont know anymore. I want to be of help to people and society, of course make a decent amount of money, and have a stable job. Ive been doing tons of research for the past month or so and im still so uncertain. I just dont know. Any advice, tips, etc would be greatly appreciated, thank you :)",

      "text": "I think the best thing you can do is to try and meet a marine biologist, vet, nurse, neuroscientist, criminologist, .... Getting as much exposure to professionals in different fields will give you a good idea of what to expect. Don't be afraid to pick something, dive in completely, and then change. I don't see the point in sitting in indecision for too long, I'm a much bigger advocate for committing to something and then switching. You won't really know what it's like until you are in it.\n\nAlso, don't think that your major will decide your profession (to some degree). It looks like you would be pretty good if you started out in Biology or Business. You could start out in one of those and see if you want to pivot into the other ones. You pretty much have 4 years to decide. For now, my advice is to meet professionals. In 2 years, pick a major and if you don't like it, pivot.",

              "text": "School was extremely science heavy, so it was a lot of work. I ended up taking eight chemistry courses and loads of bio classes. I enjoyed most of them though and finished with a B average in my classes without having to retake anything. This was while I bartended 15-20 hours a week, acted as an officer of a club, finished some scuba certifications, and still managed to party. I don't think I ever slept in college, but as long as you don't overwhelm yourself with a credit load you can't manage, you should have time to study and live your life. \n\nWhen it came to school, I was more laid back than most of my friends. I lived by the motto \"Cs get degrees\" and focused on gaining experience over my GPA. In zookeeping, it seems like having experience is viewed more highly than a good GPA, both things are obviously ideal though. So while my friends were cramming for exams to maintain a 4.0 so they could go to grad school, I was working on a presentation for the Marine Bio Club because I thought that was more valuable the time. Biggest thing is finding that right balance of school and experience. \n\nMy favorite class was Evolution because I learned a lot about animals and traits they had and it was math heavy. Both are two of my strong suites, so I loved it! The easiest class I took and the most fun was Coral Reef Ecology. There were only 20 of us in the class and we just had weekly readings and a class discussion on them. We all got to know each other and I even ended up going scuba diving with those professors!\n\nI didn't have any problems finding a job because there are three zoos in the city I live in, and I interned at two of them while I was in college. I was established in the zookeeping community, so I had a bit of an advantage when applying to full-time jobs. The best way to be considered for a full-time position is to intern at a zoo while you're a student in college. If there are no zoos around, look into volunteering at animal resuces or humane societies. Once I got my license in high school, I started volunteering at the local animal shelter! It's great experience to put on a college resume and you gain animal care experience. \n\nI do love my job, I get paid to play with sea turtles and i get to scuba dive all the time. It's really cool! But there are a lot of downfalls. First, the field is competitive and you need to be willing to move if you want to advance in the field. It's hard to get a job, especially with the pandemic going on now. Secondly, the hours. I work Sunday to Thursday so I don't have the same weekend as my friends. It puts a little damper on your social life as you can't make it to every event. Finally, the pay sucks. I still bartend to make ends meet because I don't make enough as a full-time zookeeper to support myself. I can work anywhere from 50-70 hours a week. So, just like college, I'm still not sleeping enough haha but I still love the work I do!\n\nAnymore questions I can help with?",

      "text": "If you're still undecided by the time you graduate, I would suggest entering college with an undecided major. The first year is usually nothing but general classes like math, English, and science. The first year would be the perfect time to research careers. Some colleges even offer career counseling and even a whole career exploration class. I would suggest doing both of these. Try speaking with a counselor at your high school. They can help you explore careers and figure out what you like. Also, research majors that interest you. Ask yourself whether you would enjoy taking the classes that may be required for that major. Do you like Science? Then, maybe a science major may be good for you. Do stuff like that. The more information you get, the more you will know yourself. \n\nAs a sophomore, I wouldn't stress too much about it. You've got time. When I was in high school, I thought I knew what I wanted to do, but realized that I didn't when I got to college. Honestly, I didn't discover my true passion until my first semester of college. It was an eye opener after 4 years of thinking I knew what I wanted to do. So, the same might happen to you. I still am not 100% sure as I approach the end of my second semester. I have a back up plan in mind in case I decide to switch. Good luck! I hope you find your true passion.",
