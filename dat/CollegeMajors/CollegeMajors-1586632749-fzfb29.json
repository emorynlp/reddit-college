  "text": "As from the title, you can guess I\u2019m a Computer Science (CS) major. However with each class that goes on, the difficulty increases (as it should) but thru the help of tutors and classmates I can do well enough. However, on my own I begin to think that since I rely on help, why should I go forward in something I\u2019m not entirely able to get myself? Combined with that, I battle a little bit of anxiety and it begins to make me think wildly on the future. Drop out and enlist? Switch majors (more viable), or just try to go deeper into the degree. I do have an alright grasp of the major and what to do but to do really well on assignments I would require outside help. I\u2019m a 22 year old and really want to get my life going. I think of what\u2019s the quickest way to get a worthy degree and enter the work force (without getting a very useless major).\nI currently have an internship/job for the summer coming. Although things aren\u2019t so sure because of the coronavirus. I was going to use that internship on whether or not I liked it and decide to go forth from there? I really don\u2019t know what to think. I\u2019ve never had to quit in my life before, and switching majors would make me think I have quit. It doesn\u2019t help I have these mental battles while at school but it is what it is.",

      "text": "Honestly, most majors are going to get difficult. It's just how college is. I'm majoring in English Education. Right now, I'm doing my generals but eventually I'll have to work on major courses. Eventually, I'm going to have to do classes on lesson planning (which is not easy), research essays, lots of literature reading, and lots of speech classes. Even though I am generally pretty good at these things, I've struggled at certain times. For example, I am not great at delivering speeches. I get severe stage fright, but I work through it to get a good grade on my speeches. It's just what I have to do to do what I love.\n\nYou shouldn't feel wrong about needing help. That's what professors, tutors, and advisers are for. Nobody said college was easy. It's hard work no matter what major you get. I'm guessing the more help you get the better you will understand your classes. It just takes time and practice. \n\nThe bottom line is: even if you are struggling, it does not mean that you can't do your major or that you dislike your major. Everyone struggles in college. My cousin is working on an interior design degree. She has been struggling since she was a freshman. Even for a really good artist like her, she still struggles with her classes. It's just what college is. It will all be worth it in the end though because she'll have a job she loves.\n\nIf you really feel like computer science isn't for you, then you can switch majors. I know it sounds stressful and scary but I know a few people who have switched their majors before. Someone even switched in their senior year. It's not the end of the world. Just keep at it and really think about who you are and what you love. Don't give up just because you are struggling. I would suggest talking to a career counselor, if your school has one. They can help you find out more information on computer science jobs. Good luck! You can do it!",
