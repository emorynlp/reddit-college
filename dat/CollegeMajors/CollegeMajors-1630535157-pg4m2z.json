  "text": "hi! i am a senior in high school and i've started to think about what to major in but honestly i'm completely lost. i don't know what to do. (it also doesn't help that my family full of engineering and science majors tells me i'm going to be useless if i don't go into stem)\n\nmy passion: writing, journalism, media, etc. as in... i've been writing since i was a child. won a scholastic art and writing award, a couple local awards, did my school yearbook, had internships with some solid magazines.\n\nother interests: marketing, pr, psychology, law... basically things involving interaction, communication, and how people are. i guess, social sciences?\n\nhow i feel about stem: i understand computer science, physics, most advanced maths, if i actually take time to learn it. so, i could do it, i just don't really enjoy it at all.\n\ni really want to go into a major that will be worth the money i put into it! i want all of my education to result in a job that makes MONEY!\n\nwhat major would you recommend to me? and what are some paths i could take in life, for higher education + careers?",

      "text": "I would not recommend going to CC (like the other poster recommends) unless you are strapped for cash or are completely lost and think you will not figure out a major in a few semesters. CC has some disadvantages, namely that you miss out on making friends/connections with other students, and it can be harder to get into the college you want as a transfer (depends on what school you are transferring to, though). You will have more opportunities at a four year college. \n\nAs for majors. If you are concerned a lot with getting a degree that will pay well (I'm assuming this based of your second to last sentence), you have some options. Engineering, business (Accounting, IT, finance are generally the best paying business majors), or computer science are all relatively decent paying degrees.",

              "text": "It's definitely not impossible, but we're playing a game of averages here. On average, the higher paying undergraduate degrees will be in things like engineering, finance, computer science, accounting, nursing, etc, and the degrees you mentioned will generally have a lower starting salary. You can find more concrete numbers if you google \"majors by average salary\" or something along those lines. If making a lot of money post graduation is important to you, then it would be riskier to major in one of the subjects you listed. It really is just weighing what's more important to you.\n\nHowever, I think there could be some interesting niches you could find. Economics, for instance, could be a good option if you want to go into finance, since its a social science (a very quantitative one, though) that a lot of people major in if they want to work in finance/consulting. It's very common for Econ majors to double major in political science/sociology or whatever. But you would have to do research into whether a lot of finance places recruit from your college or not, since it really depends.",

      "text": "My advice for you is to go to community college, and figure it out there. It's much easier to pivot majors, and you have more time to think about what schools you want to apply to. Try different classes and see what you enjoy the most. \n\nI know this isn't the answer you're looking for, but since you don't know what to major in I think this is the best option.",
