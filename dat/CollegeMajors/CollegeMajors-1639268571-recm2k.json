  "text": "I am a high school senior.\n\nI've been wanting to be a teacher and further my passion for History with that, hopefully inspiring students. However, taking a step back I think my wanting to be a teacher was more influenced by wanting to help LGBTQ students. Which brings me around to psychology. \n\nI've never been bad at science, with my only B in a science class being Sophomore year AP Chemistry (though that may be because I didn't take a science Junior year). However, I've never felt a really big passion for it, though I find it somewhat interesting. Regardless, if my looking to be a teacher was driven mostly by wanting to help LGBTQ students, majoring in psychology and getting a masters (maybe eventually a Ph.D) in it would allow me to counsel LGBTQ people, letting me achieve my real aspirations with more money. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with psychology as a major? Is it relatively difficult or easy as a science degree, and could it better help me achieve this end goal of mine?",

      "text": "As a STEM major, the only easy major is Business. But in all seriousness, the sciences have distinct differences including in their difficulty, Physical sciences, Social Sciences, Life Sciences. Psych fall underneath Social Sciences, and it is a difficult major for some people.\n\nIf you want to teach people AND counsel people, a good route to go is Psychology as some schools have Psych classes(my highschool was one of the richest in state, so I don't know how widespread psych classes in highschool are). You can also work in schools as a school counselor where you are able to counsel all types of kids, including LGBTQ students. I will warn you, my mother was a psych bachelor's and did an internship in a school, she said that it was horrible because you are unable to do anything for the students.\n\nIf you want a major path of sorts, do Psych major with a Teaching Studies minor and if you want to, some universities have an LGBTQ studies certificate. Good luck.",

I forgot to mention it, but grad school and further certificates will be needed for some counseling jobs, but I don't know the entire specifics.",

      "text": "Hi!!  Also a HS Senior.  My two cents: My mom has her master\u2019s in clinical mental health counseling (since 1996).  She loves her job but at least where I am in the US, New England, it is an underpaid job.\n\nShe is a children\u2019s therapist, and herself along with her colleagues are overworked and not making enough money.  She has many friends who went the PhD route but are suffocating in student loans.  It\u2019s a much needed profession but exhausting and she wants to go back to re-certify as a teacher (that was her second major).  \n\nFor a long time I wanted to get my PhD in clinical psychology but seeing my mom, her colleagues, etc. get screwed over time and time again for a job that is SO IMPORTANT (keeping children ALIVE AND SAFE) it seems like hell.  Bright outlook in the field but just wow.  \n\nJust my insight, it\u2019s why I\u2019m not planning on psych majoring anymore if this is how professionals are treated.",
