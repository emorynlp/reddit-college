  "text": "Hey, back to Reddit to figure out life as usual\\~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the fall semester I finished up my Associate's in Liberal Arts at community college after needing to change it after failing a class when I was a nursing major (it was effecting my GPA for a program that helps pay for tuition). In a rush and realizing that I needed to do something after, I chose to be a theater studies major and transferred to a four year college this spring semester. I realized and slowly confirmed through my time here that I would rather keep theater as a interest and not as a career path. So now I'm back to wondering what I want to do now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought about journalism as suggested by my parents but I knew that my heart wasn't into that field. Someone suggested marketing to me and it seems interesting. Because this is something I'm still unsure of how I feel about it, I thought about going for the associate's degree back to community college instead of spending a lot of money at this four year school I'm in now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've thought about taking a summer class, if I had time, to expose myself to it before deciding but then what?\n\nIf I like it, do I continue it at the community college?\n\nIf I don't, then what, you know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still have to meet up with the faculty adviser here in this college pretty soon and I don't feel like doing so until I know what's going on. I asked about taking a semester or so off so I can think and earn money but apparently me dropping out of school will get me off of insurance and my parents don't want that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know...thoughts on this?
