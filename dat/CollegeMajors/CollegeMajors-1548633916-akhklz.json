      "text": "I'm in a Clinical Laboratory Science(CLS)/ Medical laboratory Science (MLS) program at UTMB in Galveston and will graduate with a bachelors in 2020. \n\n**Word of advice:** It's amazing that you are ambitious to go to med school but as an incoming college freshman you need to **focus on you first degree and choose the right one** before you decide to go all the way to med school. And by choose the right one I mean the **one that will get you a job right after you graduate** **with a bachelors**. This is so you have that cushion to pay for your medical school or if you decide you rather not go anymore/ drop out of medical school you can still support yourself. Your bachelors may not be the final career choice but is a safety net none the less.\n\nNow that we have that cleared up, biology is not the way to go. Biology/ Microbiology/ Chemistry/ biochemistry degrees **by itself** will not give you a job afterwards. Why? because they do not have the certification that comes with it to allow you into the laboratory in any hospital. And they are too broad with not enough skill set and laboratory experience to get a job. And going to the premed route (getting a premed degree) is not advisable because if you do not go all the way to Medical School you are screwed over with no job and in debt. A high GPA is good and all to get in but if you do not have a job ready degree you are putting yourself in a corner with no way out but medical school. You have no idea how many people I met and the subreddits I read tell me about medical students who do not have a job after they decide to not pursue medical school or they drop out because they have a \"too broad\" of a degree like biology. \n\nSo here are my proposed suggestions: nursing or Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS)\n\nThey both get you a job in the medical field and they are both applicable to medical school. \n\nBut over which one: CLS. Here's why: \n\n* Nursing gives you experience with patient interactions, communication skills and bed side manners needed to be a doctor, I'll give them that.\n* But CLS gives you the **KNOWLEDGE to DIAGNOSE patients.** \n* Bedside manners and communication can be learned on the job, that is what those 4 years of residency is for. \n* But the background knowledge in diagnosing, recognizing diseases, understanding results cannot, that is learned in school. So why not get a head start if you are going to learn about it in medical school?\n\nSo what is CLS?\n\nCLS are laboratorians who work with and analyze patient samples to get results ordered by the physician to help them diagnose. We are basically the people doctors consult with on a diagnosis. \n\n70% of the diagnosis comes from the lab\n\nAnd with CLS degree you can be a **generalist** and go through all departments in the lab: Hematology, Blood Bank, Microbiology & Clinical Chemistry so it is never a bore because you can change up which department you go into every week or on the daily if you so desired to. Also if you like one department over another, no worries, you can specialize in that department. CLS is just a great gateway because if gives you a basic foundation. It can have jobs in hospital setting, research and even in industry. It can also be a great stepping stone for med school if so choose to do so. \n\n A CLS program will help you get that ASCP certification needed to work in a lab hospital setting. A biology degree for the most part will not get you a job. Its too broad and the degree doesn't meet criteria to get an ASCP accreditation to get into a laboratory. \n\nWith a CLS degree you can not only have a job but sample other areas of the lab through the different departments and find your niche.  CLS deals a lot with biology already, so much so that its already a pre-req. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany people I know with a non-accredited degree go back to school for CLS. So save the hassle and do your research on this career path. Ask yourself what are you going to be able to do with your degree when you graduate from a 4 year university/college before you go into medical school? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to learn more about the field check out my website I created. Its a good CLS study guide and a place to network and connect. I would love to connect & network with other aspiring CLS or those who are curious in the field. Check out the website and feel free to drop an email for more inquiries.\n\n[www.thelabratartist.com](https://www.thelabratartist.com/)\n\nI wish you good luck and hope you like the site.",
