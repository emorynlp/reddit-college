  "text": "18 here. I'm a hs senior and I'm not exactly sure what I want to do yet. But I find the three topics in the title interesting. However, I don't know much about them aside from the obvious, and that they all use math. Does anyone here have any advice regarding them or good knowledge of the topics? Thanks.",

      "text": "They are all pretty different.\n\nMeteorology is the most different from the other two. It can involve a ton of math, or not much at all, and has mixed opinions of how the field is viewed by others, especially in the natural sciences.\n\nArchitecture and engineering are pretty similar in some regards, but radically different in others. Engineers will tell you that architects only design things and it is totally artistic, but in reality, good architects integrate engineering practices into their designs prior to sending them to engineers. I think the misunderstanding comes from many engineers only working with architects who just do concept and design phase work.\n\nCivil engineering is wildly variant in itself. It covers a massive amount of topics, of which most engineers choose one to only a few to focus on in practice. It can vary from waste and storm water management, to structural design and engineering, to demolition, and many, many more.",
