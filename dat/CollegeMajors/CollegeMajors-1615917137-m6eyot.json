  "text": "Recently, I've been attracted to marketing but im kinda concerned with the salary I would make in that field since it is 50,000. Not sure if that's right. However, I do know some people who double majored or did neuroscience/lyschology then marketing. What do you guys recommend I should major in and would double majoring be difficult?",

              "text": "Marketing is at the cusp of \"hard skill\" and \"soft skill\". There still is a general mentality that marketing can be done by anyone (which is obviously not true), that keeps wages down. It also is a relatively new field (at least how it is done in the internet age), so many may not fully grasp its importance.",
