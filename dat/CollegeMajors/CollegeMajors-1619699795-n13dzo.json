  "text": "Hello everyone,\nI'm currently contemplating about studying CS. It is a field that really interests me from an academical and even business point of view. \nHowever, I know that many people who study CS. Everyone of them is really into PC hardware/software and gaming stuff, which I really don't care about. Am I overthinking this or is it actually preferable to have a certain flair / knowledge in aforementioned things ? Thanks in advance!",

CS is about logic, problem solving, and building things. If that appeals to you, I would recommend studying it, regardless of whether you're into PC/hardware stuff.",

Apple you work longer but most companies fall between those numbers. And the higher the role the more business meeting and stuff and the less coding. If you can focus doing work at a computer desk for a couple hours then you fine. Look up some day in the life videos of working and studying cs. Also remember it\u2019s very math oriented. Also what college are you planning on going too, t10 or a t100. You can ask me any questions if you want.",

As long as you like math and science and are good at both then I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll struggle a lot. The average gpa for cs is like a 2.8-3 so it\u2019s going to be hard but if you like it then it\u2019s worth it, especially from a t10.",
