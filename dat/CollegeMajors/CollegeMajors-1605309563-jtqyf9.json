  "text": "So basically the only major that grabs my attention right now is Environmental Studies. I love the outdoors, conservation, and the only class I enjoyed in high school was Environmental Science. Could any individuals that major in this subject give me the rundown of it? :\n-highs and lows\n-best career options\n-minors i should do with it\n-if its a dumb decision to major in this lol\n\nI would really appreciate any feedback in those regards! I love the idea of it, but I don\u2019t know if its a reasonable thing to major in.",

      "text": "From a non-biased standpoint, in terms of employability for environmental careers:\n\nEngineering >> Geology > Soil Science  >>>>>>>> Environmental Science > Environmental Studies \n\nBut self-fulfillment and enjoyability are subjective so your mileage will vary. \n\nIf you want to make it work do these things:\n\n1. Intern as early as possible \n2. Undergrad research with a professor \n3. Take any GiS class you can\n4. Pick up some basic programming skills like in Python or R, or more preferably try to minor in CS if possible",

I think I also might enjoy working around animals? But that\u2019d probably be a whole other thing. Regardless I appreciate the help.",
