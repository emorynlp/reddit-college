      "text": "Physics and take some Electrical Engineering (EE) classes. The issue is that if you're purely interested in electricity, Physics will only have 3 (maybe even 2) classes directly about the science behind electricity, and they're honestly so fundamental and concept driven that it's hard to connect to the real world. Incredibly interesting, just a bit \"out there.\" That's why I recommend throwing in some EE classes that interest you. Circuits 1 and 2, Digital Logic Design, Electronics 1 & 2, etc. Your school should have a list of courses with descriptions given.",
