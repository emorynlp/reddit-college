  "text": "So I have started looking into majors for college. I want to do something with the environment but not sure what. I am interested in environmental law, but I want to pick a major that I would be able to use if I stop after I graduate and don\u2019t go to law school. In the small amount of research I\u2019ve done i have seen a lot of different names for different majors that involve environmental studies. That\u2019s where it gets hard for me to decide which path to take. Anyone in the environmental science, environmental studies, environmental law, sustainability, biology fields have any advice on narrowing these down?",
