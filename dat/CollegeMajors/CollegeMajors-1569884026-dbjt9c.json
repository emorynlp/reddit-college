  "title:": "I'm a history major. Which language should I officially pursue in college?",
  "text": "To elaborate, I'm a sophomore history major interested in Eastern European history. I came into college with credit towards a French minor and have completed half of the courses required for that minor. However, I recently began taking Russian and I really enjoy it, more than I have enjoyed French. I've worked out that I could double major in Russian and History if I really wanted to, but if I do that, I can no longer pursue French, and if I pursue French, I don't have room to major/minor in Russian. Plus, I fear that it might be difficult to build proficiency if I tried to do both at once.\n\nWould it be silly to quit the French minor now and pursue Russian? Or should I leave French since I enjoy Russian and it's more relevant to my field of study?",

(1) you\u2019ll enjoy it more, (2) a major is better than a minor, and (3) it\u2019s more relevant to your studies. \n\nAre you interested in going to grad school? If you want an MA or PhD in Eastern European history, you\u2019ll have to learn Russian. The same cannot be for French (broadly, at least).",

Don\u2019t get attached to French cus it\u2019s the easier option, being you already started it. And Russian is better for your degree. I\u2019d say go ahead and get started with it. As long as you like what you\u2019re doing it\u2019s all good.",
