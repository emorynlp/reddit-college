  "title:": "Political Science or History?",
  "text": "Currently I am double majoring in History and Economics, and planning to go to law school. My plan was to have the Economics degree for more hard skills, and a History degree/English minor to prepare myself for the writing of law school and leave open the possibility of teaching. I really do love history, but I also love political science, and I just was looking for some insight on the differences between the two degrees. I saw somewhere that political science is more data oriented, which might be more of a fit for me. Does that make it a worse prep degree for law school then? \n\nAlso, I am really interested in politics, and would probably like to do some work in the field, but I plan to practice law first. Would a political science degree make a solid difference in this, or is it more marginal?\n\nThank you!",
