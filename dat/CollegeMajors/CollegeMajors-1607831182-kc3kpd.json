Public health and business administration are both good majors, however with public health you will usually need a masters to get a good job. Plus business administration is more versatile. Id say business administration for sure. Just dont get a psy degree plz, youll end up making 10 bucks an hour",

I read some of your reddit comments and they\u2019re all condescending af. Please don\u2019t give this type of rude advice when you\u2019re at most 17 years old and don\u2019t know a thing about getting a job with a degree. OP if you\u2019re interested in psychology, don\u2019t knock it off the list. Your degree is about the skills you get from it. There are plentyyy of jobs for a psychology bachelors. Don\u2019t be fooled that you automatically have to pick a major that specifically paves the way for you into a specific job. This goes for every major: what\u2019s valuable is the skills you get from it and every major will teach you or give u the opportunity to get valuable (and marketable) skills",

If he enjoys them all, why not go for the best valued degree? You dont go to college to necessarily study something you\u2019re passionate about (although this can intertwine with the next point), you go to college to obtain skills that are valuable to the market or graduate schools. A Business major would kill a psychology major in terms of market value.",

Do some research, im sure you know how",

Im looking at wanting a degree that will make me around 70k-90k any other major you can recommend me other than engineering or computer science majors ? Any input would be greatly appreciated, Thanks once again",
