  "title:": "GIS or Information Systems with BI Emphasis",
  "text": "I am a veteran looking to utilize my GI bill. Geographic Information Science and Information Systems with an emphasis in Business Intelligence are two similar majors that match my interest and experience. I am leaning towards the IS/BI degree. My only concern is getting stuck at marketing job after college where I have to over-analyze customer preferences on what color shoes customers prefer. I\u2019m more interested in fields that align closer to the public sector like space exploration, law enforcement, environment, etc. What are your thoughts?",

      "text": "If your interests are more aligned with law enforcement and the environmental sectors, GIS is certainly the way to go in my opinion. Even outside of this, there are plenty of in-demand careers that will let you draft and analyze maps for your company. Now warranted, you have to really like cartography and geospatial analysis, but if you\u2019re considering a GIS major, you probably have some interest.\n\nI don\u2019t have much information on Information Sciences unfortunately, but I have learned a bit of GIS and I do work with GIS professionals on a day to day basis. It\u2019s pretty variable work. I believe to receive your professional licensure, you do have to get a Masters, but most GIS jobs don\u2019t actually require that apart from land surveying. Some companies may also pay for your certification too.",

          "text": "For reference, you do not need a masters degree to be a GIS Professional, or GISP.\n\nCertification is carried out by GISCI [GISP](https://www.gisci.org/) process. Overall, there is a real love-hate relationship (mostly hate though) with the certificate as you technically don't even need a degree whatsoever, as long as you pass.\n\nFWIW; I majored in geography with a minor in GIS for my BS. The Information Science portion is pretty hard to market on its own, most employers want someone who is bringing other, additional skills to the plate beyond just GIS. \n\nOverall, my experience reflected this as well, as there was no way for my school to come up with enough credits to justify a major in GIS, which is the same as the school I go to now for both MA and BA/BS degrees, they only offer a certificate at each level.",

              "text": "Thanks for more clarification! I\u2019m not someone who really works with it as my main job. I\u2019ve just taken courses on it as a complement to it, but I do work with people who only do that. My company requires licensure to be listed as an actual GIS professional, but I know most people just go by without it and still do the same work.\n\nInteresting, my university offers an MS in GIS, which most people I know do, that has the certification process wrapped into it. I believe it\u2019s an accelerated Masters program if you already have a degree related to it.",
