  "title:": "Stuck Between SCM and HRM",
  "text": "Currently, I am a junior going for a BBA with an emphasis in supply chain management. I figured the pay would be really nice and it would offer many job opportunities. However, I am struggling in my classes and not finding them very enjoyable. I also know the job entails a lot of stress and I am not good with a lot of stress.  \nEveryone tells me I would be great in HR. I am a very friendly, approachable person and the tasks seem up my alley. However, I feel like an emphasis on HR would limit my job opportunities if I decide I am unhappy with it.\n\nI just want to know whether the switch will be worth it. If anyone has any advice or insight please let me know. Thank you! :)",
