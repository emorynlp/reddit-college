      "text": "I'm currently in school as a double major in Economics and Finance. For Economics specifically, intro classes throw a lot of information at you right away so it may seem a little daunting. However, as you take higher and higher classes it gets more instresting. Math is very important, it's only my second semester and I'm in Calc 3 and planning on taking more math courses. If you find it interesting, definitely stick with it.",

      "text": "I got in university at first as an economics major, although I haven't made plenty of research about it, it just sounded good to me. The second I got in I was shocked by how hard it was and got very bad grades in all the classes. My GPA was so low I was scared of getting kicked out of the university so I said fuck it, this isn't for me and switched majors, I'm doing fine now. \n\nThis is coming from someone who's really bad at Math though, like I'm really bad. I'm sure you're way better than me at it, all my life I struggled with math so my opinion may be biased.",

The math might pick up down the line and knowing some calculus will help a great deal. Graphs are a big part of Econ at all levels so I\u2019d get comfortable with those as well. \n\nOverall, Econ seems to be easy for some, difficult for others. The math can seem daunting at times but you\u2019ll most likely have pre-reqs that\u2019ll help teach you more advanced concepts. If you don\u2019t like math then maybe consider something else. If you\u2019re just behind in math, you\u2019ll get caught up in-class and with other pre-reqs as well. I enjoyed the economics classes I took quite a bit but it\u2019s just never hit the spot, personally. Best of luck!",
