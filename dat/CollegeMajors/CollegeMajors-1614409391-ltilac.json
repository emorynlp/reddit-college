  "text": "I'm at a local community college in my state, second semester of my first year. I went into college as a Criminal Justice major and I was so sure I would go somewhere with it, and realized I absolutely hated it so I switched over to English Arts. I don't know what I want to do, I have absolutely no interests as far as a \"dream job\" goes. I don't hate my major, but I don't see myself going anywhere with it and I still feel like I'm in the wrong major. Dropping out isn't really an option and it doesn't help that I feel so lost and unmotivated because I don't know what I'm doing.",

      "text": "If you don't have any interests and don't know what major to pursue, maybe taking some time off to just talk to people in different career paths and do a lot of researching? I know a guy who was a math major his sophomore year of college, planning to go get his PHD, but found out after taking a few higher level classes that it just wasn't for him. So the summer going into his junior year he shadowed a doctor, found out he was really interested in the field, and finished his premed requirements in 2 years and is now at med school. So it can do a lot of good, just asking people in different career paths if you could shadow them, or interviewing them to get a better idea of what their job is like, and watching videos on YouTube, etc. That might be a good way to figure out what you want to do before spending more time in school on something you don't find interesting. Heck, there are a lot of subreddits that are dedicated to specific career paths that could be useful. like if you're interested in nursing, /r/nursing , engineering? /r/engineers. It might be worthwhile.\n\nFortunately, this is only your first year, so you do have time to mess around and try out different majors. You might also want see if your community college has career resources, like career tests (you can find some of these online), counselors, etc. that you can talk to.",
