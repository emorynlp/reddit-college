  "text": "I am currently in a junior college and set to receive my Associates of Arts degree. I am looking to transfer to a four year university but I am unsure which degree I should receive. I want to be a professional film critic, like the ones you see on newspaper or online. I was doing my research and it seems like I should study film studies, of course this deals with films, or study journalism, as most film critics have writing skills. Which route should I go?",

      "text": "Journalism is probably the more lucrative as the opportunities for film criticism are limited.  A film studies degree will put you into a more competitive arena with even fewer open positions whereas a Journalism major will allow you to move a bit more freely within the culture & arts sections, or other sections, of writing, to keep busy with work.\n\nBut I'm not going to sugarcoat: the jobs are few and far between and the pay is abysmal.  This really needs to be something you could love being broke over for the better part of two decades.  What you must love is not film, because you're going to get tired of it.  What you must love is the craziness of being crammed into a press room or newsroom trying to crank out a fully-formed 400 word piece in under two hours.  You must love editors screaming at you to get your piece in.  You must love working all hours of the day, and night.\n\nI haven't even talked about the enablers, the addictions, the layoffs, the harassment... but if none of this makes you pause, and you thrive under insane amounts of pressure, you might be a journalist.",
