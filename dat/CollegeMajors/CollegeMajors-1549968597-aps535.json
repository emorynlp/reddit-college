      "text": "Many SBS majors are useful in a corporate environment, and they either have their own dedicated positions, or fall within categories like HR. As for Psychology, there exists Independent Organization Psychology, which basically means you are a dedicated Psychologist for one corporation and their employees. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, this position seems to have stable growth and opportunities, but requires a Masters degree at the very least in I/O Psych or a related subfield. With only a BA or BS, you could probably find work within HR or a related department! ",
