  "text": "I am now a senior in high school and I have yet to figure out what I want to major in when I go off to college. Most people say you don\u2019t really need to know what you want to major in until your third year of college but I would like to have at least an idea of something I could go into. The hard thing is though that I don\u2019t really have a particular interest in anything and I think that\u2019s mainly because I\u2019ve never really been told what options are out there to choose from. \n\nI'm not the best math (I've mainly made B\u2019s in the math classes I have taken in high school). Other than math I am a straight-A student and member of NHS (if that actually means anything in the real world). I love the read but I can not see myself as a teacher or professor in the subject because reading to me is just a hobby of some sort. \n\nI would like to have a job that pays really well so I can support myself and my family. At this point, I don't mind doing something that doesn't interest me because I'll eventually learn to like it. \n\nIf you could tell me your occupation and why you love it that would be amazing. Thank you.",

      "text": "If you like reading and want a high paying job, look into law. That is not a major, though. Law schools mostly care about your GPA and LSAT test, so theoretically you could major in anything. Most people major in things like english, history, political science (the biggest one for law) and criminal justice.\n\nI am a medieval studies major and I am going into law. Proof that they don't care about your major. What I would suggest for you is to get through high school, get into college, and take courses on anything and everything that sounds remotely interesting in your first year. It will weed out what you do and don't want to learn (for example, I learned I love art history and hate psychology just by using this tactic. I am going into my second year now).\n\nRemember, you are only 17 (I am assuming). You're still in high school. You don't have to know right at this exact second. Things will all fall into place.\n\nHope this helped!",

At this point, I don't mind doing something that doesn't interest me because I'll eventually learn to like it.\n\nThe options I'm going to list are based off of this part of what you wrote. If you are going to well paying majors that don't involve much math, I think the following are the best options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBusiness degrees. The most well paying business degrees are IT, management information systems, finance, accounting. In particular, finance is probably the highest paying if you go to a top business school, if not, accounting is probably the most \"stable\"/best paying degree. Generally these degrees don't involve much math. For business degrees, though, your extracurriculars and networking abilities are going to be important.\n\nNursing. Very stable overall, healthcare jobs are expected to increase a ton in the next few years. Generally a very demanding career though. Your heart definitely should be in it if you want to do this.\n\ncomputer science. This degree has more math than the two previous ones, but it isn't as math heavy as something like engineering or physics. You'll probably have to take a couple of semesters of calculus, linear algebra, discrete math, computer science theory, analysis of algorithms, and maybe a stats class or something else. Depending on what type of programming job you get after college, though, there could be almost no math involved. This major is well paying, but it's definitely competitive, and you're going to have to put in a ton of extra time into studying for interviews, doing outside projects, learning new technologies, etc. \n\nI would definitely recommend doing something you find interesting though. Most of these degrees pay well, but also require extracurriculars and hustle to get the best jobs (nursing may be the exception). Do one you find interesting, and you'll probably be more motivated and ultimately more successful.",

      "text": "IMO you should definitely pick your major before your third year of college. That's very late. Not knowing during your first year is totally fine though. \n\nIf you don't have any particular interests, is there a subject you feel like you accelled at more than the others? Do you want a major that teaches you technical skills, or one that has more of a focus on soft skills? There are online tests that you can take that will tell you what group of majors suits you best since you haven't really narrowed it down at all yet. \n\nMy major, architecture, is full of people who are hard working and passionate. The content is interesting and I get to work on a lot of projects instead of just exams and essays, but the course load is massive. I've also learned how to do a lot of things (AutoCAD, modeling, drawing, 3D printing, etc) that I like.  I would probably only recommend it to people who are also passionate about the topic since it can have a real toll on your social life and sleep schedule.",

I\u2019ve actually wanted to do architecture for a while but people have told me since I\u2019m not the best at math that I shouldn\u2019t really look into it. I just assumed I had to be extremely smart if I wanted to take it on. Do you have any advice for people who want to take architecture and maybe reasons why they shouldn\u2019t take it? I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to answer this :)",

              "text": "No problem! This is the one thing on this sub that I'm actually qualified to answer. \n\nI did not consider myself good at math in high school. I am still not \"good\" at math. There are a few different types of architecture programs and, barring architectural engineering, most of them do not focus on the math part. Yes, you will probably have to take up to at least Calc 1. This is doable if you're willing to put in the time to learn the content. There are also often structures classes that involve math, but they are closer to physics than pure mathematics. I personally had a much easier time with physics than math and found the concepts easier to wrap my head around. \n\nArchitecture isn't about being smart, it's about hard work and time management. Design/art skills also play a significant part but some people are able to learn those if they don't have them already. \n\nThere are a few different types of degrees, but the accrediting body that oversees architecture degrees that can lead to licensure is the NAAB. There is a list of schools available on their website that are accredited and I would highly recommend that anybody interested in an architecture degree pursue one of those. You can work in an architecture firm without one of these degrees, but it is much harder to get a license down the road. There are Bachelor of Arts in Architecture degrees, which are more liberal arts focused and at least at my school have less studio time (not for licensure),  Bachelor of Science in Architecture degrees which have studio and technology as the primary focuses (my undergrad was one of these, not for licensure), Bachelor of Architecture degrees which are usually five years long and allow you to be licensed after just undergrad, and Master of Architecture degrees which can be done both from an architecture or non-architecture background and allow you to pursue a license through your education (I am about to finish one of these). If your undergrad is in architecture, often the M. Arch degrees only take one or two years. My school's program is a 4+1, so I will be graduating with my masters after five years. If you come in with a unrelated undergrad it's usually closer to 3 years for an M. Arch. After you have an accredited degree, you need 3-5 years of experience in a firm under the supervision of an architect as well as a passing grade on the ARE exams to get a license. Not everybody pursues this, but it's good to leave your options open as a first year. \n\nThe most important course in architecture school is studio. Times are a little weird right now so this year might be an exception, but generally most architecture students are given a desk in a semi-open room with their peers where they can work on their projects. This class takes all of your free time like a sponge. It's usually 12 hours per week in class, and I think that my freshman year I usually did 30 hours per week of homework for studio alone before counting my other homework. I had no social life to speak of and most of my peers basically just hung out with only architecture students. I got better at time management as I went through college, but I barely slept for the first two years of undergrad because I understood working hard but didn't know when to call it quits for the night. I don't recommend doing that, I got my first grey hair at 19 lol. The longest I've stayed awake is 3 straight days. Poor time management skills will kill you. \n\nAs bad as the sleepless nights and homework filled days have been, I can't really picture myself doing anything else. There's a broad mix of science, art, writing, and history that I find pretty well rounded. I've learned skills that will actually help me not just in class or a job but also for my hobbies. Also, while it can be hard to get jobs in specific places, most of the people I know from undergrad who didn't pursue their masters are employed in the field. I graduate in August and have a job lined up, which I'm super excited about. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask.",
