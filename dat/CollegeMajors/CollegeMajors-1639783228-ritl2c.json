  "text": "Good evening, everyone! \n\nI am a 24 F and I am currently studying my bachelor\u2019s degree of Biological Sciences specializing in Biopharmaceutical Sciences. I\u2019ve been having this thought now but I feel like the degree I\u2019m close to graduating with (biological sciences) there aren\u2019t much job prospects to it. Am I making a mistake in doing this major? The end goal is to do medical school, not necessarily anything pharmacy related.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear all of your opinions! Thank you for listening.",

      "text": "If you aren't interested in pharmaceuticals, why do a degree related to it? Biological sciences is fine, specialize in something you are interested in. Your specialization won't lock you into one job or field, it's just a small part of a bachelor's degree.\n\nBiological sciences will prepare you for med school, but doesn't guarantee you getting in. Could you see yourself working in ecology? Maybe a fishery? As a lab tech? What about going to grad school for a master's or PhD? Make sure you like your career options, the career not just the idea of one, before you graduate with a degree in that field.",

          "text": "In my school, the bachelor\u2019s program they have available only has three main specializations (bio pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and biology education). Biopharmaceutical sciences concentrations are mainly used for students who either want to pursue pharmacy school or medical school, PA school, vet school, etc any other grad school. The goal I\u2019d like to pursue is med school. You\u2019re absolutely right though, it doesn\u2019t guarantee I get in! I do like things dealing with the environment so possibly. I like that\u2026making sure I like my career options and not just the idea of one. I\u2019ll keep that in mind! Thank you.",
