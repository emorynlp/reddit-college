  "text": "Good evening, everyone! \n\nI am a 24 F and I am currently studying my bachelor\u2019s degree of Biological Sciences specializing in Biopharmaceutical Sciences. I\u2019ve been having this thought now but I feel like the degree I\u2019m close to graduating with (biological sciences) there aren\u2019t much job prospects to it. Am I making a mistake in doing this major? The end goal is to do medical school, not necessarily anything pharmacy related.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear all of your opinions! Thank you for listening.",
