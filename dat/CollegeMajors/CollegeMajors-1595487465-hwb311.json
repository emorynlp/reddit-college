  "title:": "Uncertain about my major",
  "text": "Hello everyone! I\u2019m already two years into my college career and I\u2019m still uncertain about what I want to major in and the future I want to pursue. I recently transferred from a local college to a state university to my options are even larger now. Basically, I\u2019m stuck between pursuing a double major in Fashion and Graphic Design or literally anything else. One of the majors I recently found that sound interesting is Horticulture but knowing me and the amount of science and math classes that takes, it would be the only major I would have. I jump around wanting to work in a social change job, a \u201cdark academia\u201d job, an art job, or a science job so it\u2019s getting particularly difficult to ground myself. College advisors usually suck so any feedback would be helpful. Thank you all!",
