  "text": "Hi guys! \n\nI have been trying to do research on being a weathercaster, and I have not been able to find a specific answer about what majors a weathercaster can find. The websites I read didn't agree with each other. I have seen Atmospheric Studies (Duh), Physics, communications, and journalism. Some even said you technically don't need anything to become one. I originally going to major in journalism until one of my teachers recommended that I consider meteorology, and I found that being a weathercaster would fit for me.\n\nIs it possible for me to become a weathercaster with a journalism degree?\n\nCan I major in journalism then do a course on Atmospheric studies after? (or is this a bad idea)\n\nThank you guys so much in advance.",

      "text": "I would say don't go for a physics degree as that won't really help out. I would say that getting a degree in atmospheric studies or meteorology would be good. If you're willing to double major, do a double major in that and communications, journalism, or media studies. I would research universities that offer these degrees, and go from there. If you are really undecided, consider going to community college, and then continuing on",

          "text": "on the flip side, an atmospheric sciences degree at most colleges will require a lot of math and physics, so if you go physics there will still be many opportunities. Some of the classes that are required at my school for a BA in Atmosphere / Meterology:\n\n\\- Math: Calculus 1, 2, and 3 // Differential Equations // Stats Analysis \n\n\\- Physics: Thermal physics, mechanics, waves // Modern physics + optics  \n\nand i agree with dual majoring in something related to comm / journalism is a good choice if you can fit it in. Networking here seems super important so soft skills are essential.",
