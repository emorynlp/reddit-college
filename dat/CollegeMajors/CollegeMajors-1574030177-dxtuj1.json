  "title:": "Senior in hs need help deciding on a major and don\u2019t know my passion- marketing/advertising, engineering, industrial design, environmental science, zoology?????",
  "text": "Ok so I have many different interests but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be sustainable career paths, especially when student loan debt is involved. On one hand I have teachers telling me to follow my passion, one explaining that studies show money does buy happiness but only up until a certain salary (around 60,000-80,000). But then on the other hand I have my older sisters and a sister\u2019s bf telling me that I have to choose a degree that will make me a lot of money so that I can afford to have a passion in my free time. \n\nMy family thinks I\u2019m some kind of genius because I\u2019ve done significantly better than them in school (a somewhat very dumb school with very low testing averages compared to state). But I feel as if I\u2019m the \u201caverage\u201d smart. A 4.15 gpa (weighted) and a 1350 on my sat, all 7 of my classes right now are AP (I dropped lunch and gym to take more APs). \n\nSo they think I should choose a STEM major, preferably a mechanical engineering one. The problem is that I took AP physics and hated it, took honors precalculus junior year and struggled pretty hard so as a senior I\u2019m taking AP stats instead of a calculus class. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m extremely cut out for an extremely science/math based degree since I\u2019ve always been better at/more passionate about my English/social studies classes. I also researched and watched YouTube videos of the day in the life of a job in engineering and I\u2019m SO put off by the job, the concepts don\u2019t interest me and I know I\u2019d hate everyday of my life having to do confusing stuff, even if the paychecks are big. \n\nBut with that being said, the money/careers aren\u2019t there for those types of degrees. I\u2019d love to study psychology, environmental science, wildlife sanctuary stuff but I know those are more interest based than sustainable career paths. \n\nSo then I was thinking, maybe marketing major and advertising minor? They don\u2019t have the BEST payouts but I think I\u2019d quite enjoy spending the rest of my life with a job in the field. I also would love to have my own business one day so it\u2019d be nice to end up having some background in how to do that. \n\nBut also, in my many hours of research of different career paths, I discovered industrial design. I fell in love with the career and the idea of having a little bit of art, engineering, and marketing all into one and with more small scale creating (as opposed to nuclear plants or sewage treatment like with solely engineering). The pay is about the same/possibly better than a marketing degree. But the problem is that almost every college that has it, the program is within the art school of the college. I\u2019d feel like I was wasting all my potential going to an art program and if I were to not be able to find work, the degree may not be very versatile since it\u2019s so art based. Also, since I\u2019ve focused to hard on taking \u201csmart\u201d classes all through high school, I\u2019ve taken no art classes. So if entry to the program requires a portfolio, I\u2019m screwed. I have no background in art besides my personal interest/drawings, so I believe I have skill, just not \u201cmarketable\u201d skill I could show to colleges. \n\nPlease give me some advice/opinions (you can be as harsh and real as you want) about what I should do, I plan on just getting a bachelors and starting work and then possibly in the future going back for a masters, but if I hate the degree I get I can\u2019t imagine going back.",

      "text": "I can\u2019t tell you what you should do, but based on what you\u2019ve said do not do engineering, or stem unless you KNOW that\u2019s something you actually want to do and have a career in. I have a few friends who do engineering, and from what I\u2019ve heard from them, you will absolutely hate it unless you have a very high interest in it. They all have a lot of interest in it, and being in the field after graduating, but the workload and intensity have them doubting it sometimes. You have to weigh the pros and the cons. Yeah, we all want high paying jobs. You would be able to pursue passions outside of your job, but at the cost of hating your job? Not worth it to me personally.",
