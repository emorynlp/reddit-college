      "text": "I quit Biochemistry because of external factors. Freshmen didn't get to choose their class sections, so I had an EXTREMELY late lab (7:30pm - 10:30pm), making me come back to my dorm around 11:00 - 11:30pm. I know it doesn't *sound* like a lot but it made me miserable. A few month before the semester started, I had a job at a chain bakery (start time was 2:30pm), and I'd come home around 1:00am - 3:00am, so it reminded me of that a lot. My advisor gave me a lot of random 30 minute breaks in between my classes, so it was also extremely annoying because I didn't know what productive thing to do in between classes. Don't even get me started on COMMUTING from dorm to classes. Big waste of time. I think maybe I just didn't know how to time manage...\n\nTo this day, **I still wonder** what would have happened if I had a normal lab time. I dedicated my **whole** high-school career to Biochemistry just for me to become exhausted.\n\nThough, I'm equally happy with my double major today (Economics concentrating in Data Science, and Nursing).",

      "text": "Currently I do Finance and Accounting as a double major. I'm really happy with both, but if I had to do something else, I would choose to pair a \"people-y\" major with my academic portfolio (ie. communications, marketing, or psychology). \n\nJust remember to get the degree. I know more than 80% of Americans land in jobs completely separate of their field of study.",

      "text": "I\u2019m still in college but 3 years behind due to constantly changing it & taking time off. I wish I just stuck with one thing even if I couldn\u2019t see myself doing it. A degree doesn\u2019t put you in a box\u2014you can always branch out or go back to school. Even people who major in something and work in that field say they learn most on the job. Personally I wish I never switched from my communication disorder major (switched due to fear/anxiety). I\u2019m currently switching back to it. I was doing mass communications but my greatest fear is feeling unfulfilled and/or being at a desk/computer job...so...that\u2019s more likely with that degree.",
