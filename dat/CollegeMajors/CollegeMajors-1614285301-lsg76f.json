  "text": "I am a senior in high school and I\u2019m undecided on a career. But, as of now I would like to be a marine biology high school teacher in California. But I would also want to teach biology as well. My selected major right now is marine biology. So I was just wondering if it would be more beneficial to major in biology instead for this specific career.",

      "text": "I am not sure about your state but in my state, you can major in anything, just as long as you take the required education class and take praxis 1 and 2. Some states do not use the praxis or have their own test.\n\nI major in math. I took the ACT in place of praxis 1 and I took praxis 2 in math. Since I minor in Chemistry, that automatically transfers onto my teacher license. I also went in took the Sped praxis test with no background in sped.",
