You'll probably have to take the American MCAT and idk if you can do that in France? Not sure. Honestly I'd email someone from a med school's admissions office, they are usually pretty helpful",

          "text": "Well I've never looked at any foreign universities. If what you say is true then you've done the research so that is your decision to make. But most med schools are based on high academic standards  and they use the American grading system for those standards. A GPA in a foreign country and a score with a foreign MCAT exam will not be looked on as favorably as a similar score from an American college. It's pretty common for STEM majors to do a degree in a foreign country, but their undergrad is usually done domestically and their graduate studies are done abroad.",

I'd highly recommend giving up on all 4 years being spent in France. Do community college for 2 with a French minor and then study abroad during the summer or for one semester.\n\nHaving an undergrad in a foreign country will make med schools see you as less desirable. And for any pre-med or pre-law aspirations always have a backup plan in the case you don't get accepted.",
