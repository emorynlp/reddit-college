  "title:": "Can a Business major help me do what I want?",
  "text": "I\u2019m 20F just applied for college (transferring as a sophomore from Junior college) and chose business as a major, but after some research and questionable looks from friends already in college, I\u2019m having doubts. I\u2019ve already changed my major in junior college twice and my parents tell me that business can apply to anything I want to do but i\u2019m unsure. \n\nI\u2019ve taken probably all of the major quizzes online but I haven\u2019t found any that really stand out. \nI want to be able to communicate with people, promote sustainability in businesses, create marketing strategies, product packaging and design/themes that stand out, and ads that are creative and innovative. I want to communicate with people and change the game to be more modern in both advertising and policy towards both products and workers rights, but I know Marketing is a little risky and broad to go into and I want to actually make a living and may not get me the creative aspects and control I want. \n\nI start in a couple of months, any advice on majors coupled with minors that could help me achieve this?",

      "text": "I think for the first part of your ideas, business is a good starting point. Many want to go into sustainability and have no clue on how business works. But, communicating with people, promoting sustainability and creating marketing strategies are very different jobs from product packaging, from design/themes and from ads. Those are more or less four broad areas which are probably still very far from each other. I think with business you are playing it safe. But if you know what you want, and have a clear image and not just some rough ideas, then go for what ever you want and get as specific as you like in your major. Every single industry can be risky to go into. And you won't get control in the beginning since you'll start out in a junior/intern position and will do what people tell you to and they will take your work and change stuff up. Creativity on the other hand will be present in certain jobs, even tho it might be happening in a stiff set of rules and not the free idea flowing kind of process.   \n\n\nMaybe think it trough, do you want to be creative? Be involved in creating designs? Or do you want to do the strategy behind it?   \nFor the strategy, stay with business. It will give you a good starting point, from which you'll get farther by interning and taking on jobs.   \nFor the creative designing, go into a creative major. Graphic design, UX design, all kinds of design majors will be a better idea. And definitely work on getting yourself a portfolio while still studying. It could be a massive benefit when applying.",
