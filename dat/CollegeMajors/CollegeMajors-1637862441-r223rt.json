  "text": "I know many of you will be applying for colleges this cycle so I have a tip of the week: avoid using \"garble\" in your college essays.\n\n\"Garble\" is a word I coined to refer to filler words that sound like you're saying something but they're so generic and lack direction that they actually mean NOTHING. Essentially, garble is a string of meaningless words.\n\nHere's a resource you might find helpful: [https://thecollegeherald.com/avoid-using-garble-in-your-college-essays/](https://thecollegeherald.com/avoid-using-garble-in-your-college-essays/)\n\n**Just a bit about myself:** I have edited dozens of college essays and see this mistake ALL the time. I'm also a FIRST-GEN student (from a low-income family) who graduated from UCLA (undergrad) and Columbia (grad) - have also been accepted into Penn, USC, and others.",
