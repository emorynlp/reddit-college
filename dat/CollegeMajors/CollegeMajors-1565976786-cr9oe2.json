  "text": "Hi, I\u2019m going to be a college sophomore and want some advice on the majors I\u2019m looking at. I\u2019m currently in communications and have taken several comm classes. Only thing is I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019d really do with the major after school, what field is fo into, and I\u2019m a introvert as well.( I know introverts can do well in comm but I don\u2019t like public speaking and such too much).  Lately I\u2019ve looked at the geography degree as well, it definitely interests me. More the human geography side but I do like computers so GIS could be a possibility too. But like comm, I don\u2019t really know where this would lead me in terms of an entry level job.  Otherwise I do like computers and I\u2019m probably gonna learn Some more IT on the side too have something else to fall back onto if I need. So what do you think would be better to get, a general communications degree, or geography degree ( probably BS degree as my school recommended). Thanks for your recommendations!",

      "text": "There are a lot of careers for geography majors in GIS, environmental policy and consulting, urban planning, design, etc. personally both the courses and the career possibilities for geography excite me more than communications. I would definitely talk to the department head about your entry level career options, at least at my college since it is a smaller department it seems like the faculty is very supportive and involved with students with lots of internship opportunities. I\u2019m not a geography major but I was briefly considering a second major or minor in it.",
