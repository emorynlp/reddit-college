  "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm a senior at an ivy-league majoring in sociology and economics. I've finished my sociology major and am just taking an honors thesis class now. I added on the economics major junior year because I enjoyed the intro level courses and thought economics would complement sociology well and expand my job/grad school prospects. But the classes have taken a toll on me. My gpa went from a 3.9 to a 3.6 because of two C's in intermediate classes and I have 5 courses left to finish the major. I am taking 3 this semester (that makes my courseload 22 credits with all other college requirements) and I'll have to take two more next semester. The classes this semester are doable but I'm afraid of lowering my gpa even further because when I overload, I do poorly on classes and I've only accepted that fact now. I'm considering dropping the econ major to free up my courseload but I'm afraid that I won't have many options after college in terms of jobs/ grad school. The 3 econ courses really add a lot to my workload (even though they're relatively easy compared to the classes I got C's in). I just don't think I can manage it all and it's taking a toll on my mental health. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs it necessary for me to finish the econ major? I've completed 7 classes (with 2 C's and rest A's and B's) and have 5 more left for this year (senior year, currently taking 3). I'm just exhausted. Please advise.",

      "text": "Well are you still in time to drop your current econ classes or do you need to finish them at this point? If you finish these 3, but skip out on the last 2, will you regret not finishing it? 2 years after graduation, will you be saying, \"I should have just finished the degree\"? \n\nWhat will your credit load be next semester? Can you pair them with fewer and easier courses, or will it be like this semester all over again? \n\nI'm usually not in favor of overloading oneself (ex. 22 credits!), so if this were prior to this semester, I'd say drop the major, change it to a minor, or just move on. But at this point...you're so close! And a 3.6 GPA is still a good GPA. If I were you, I'd be super proud of myself. \n\nLastly, another thing you should be asking yourself is: do you want to work in economics? Is there a field or job you think this degree will allow you to work in that the sociology degree would not allow you to do?",

          "text": "Thank you so much for your advice! I can still drop these 3 courses, meaning I'd have 5 courses left. \n\nAnd I want to work in international development or in non-profit and although an economics bachelor's degree would be helpful, I think I would pursue a master's more fitted for my interests. I just don't know if I can handle 22 credits this semester and that's why I want to drop the 3 econ courses, which would mean dropping the major.",
