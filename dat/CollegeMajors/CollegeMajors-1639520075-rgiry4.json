  "title:": "I'm currently an ecology major and I would like to study psychedelics in an academic manor, could a double major in psychology help?",
  "text": "I love animals and I'm very passionate about conservation, but I'm also totally fascinated by the history of psychedelics and how they can be used in a psychiatrist context. My end goal is to get a PhD and work in a lab or teach. Terence McKenna majored in ecology and had an interest in psychology. Timothy Leary was \"just\" a psychologist. Christian R\u00e4tsch is an anthropologist. I'm not saying I'd end up as big as any of them, but they're all my inspirations.",

      "text": "Psychiatry/psychology is going to be absolutely crucial if you're interested in the therapeutic aspect of psyches. Additionally, chemistry/biochemistry/pharmacology will be helpful in understanding the drugs, and why they do what they do. Maybe look into a double major if possible. In regards to the PhD, I imagine you'll know what to pursue that in when the time comes\n\nKeep in mind that you can always work towards conservation efforts whenever, and you can still study ecology on your own. There are plenty of conservationists with degrees not related to what they do. Christopher Gillette has a Bachelor's in climate science, but is a wildlife biologist.\n\nI know Alexander Shulgin got his PhD in biochemistry, and did post doc work related to psychiatry\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I was much help, but this is what I know as I have a lot of the same interests. Good luck my friend :)",

      "text": "It really depends what part of psychedelics you want to research. Development? Chemistry/Biochemistry. Psychological affects? Psychology. How it affects a population? Ecology or Anthropology, maybe even sociology. It really does depend on what scale and what part of psychedelics.",
