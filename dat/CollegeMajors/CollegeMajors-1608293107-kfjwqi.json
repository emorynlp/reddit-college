  "text": "Hello! I'm currently a second year student in college who's thinking of switching majors from biochemistry to an engineering disciple. My intended career is to become a clinical engineer or tissue engineer. But I'm not sure which major would be best for these positions- CE? BME?(I'm aware BME is lacking as a bachelor's but \"ok-ish\" for a master's/phd). ME & EE are out of my list. I do plan on working for 2-4 years with just a bachelor's degree before pursuing graduate school; probably a master's in BME or pharmacy/med school.\n\nSome other questions I'm wondering about are: - How will the job market for chemical engineers look like in the next 2+ years? Specifically here in the US and Canada                                                     \n- Is it possible for a chemical engineer to become a biomedical engineer? If so, how? What classes should be taken/ specialization?                             \n- Do you know any successful engineering premeds? I am fully aware any engineering is tough and will definitely drag down the gpa but this is just something I'm pondering over as an option after working for a few years.\n\nThank you! I appreciate any responses as this is pretty urgent to me (need to declare major for transfer applications within the first week of Jan). I've read a lot of reddit posts but sadly, none of it really answers my questions.",

      "text": "I\u2019m not quite sure what clinical engineering is but as far as tissue engineering goes, I believe that\u2019s less traditional engineering and more pure science based. \n\nBiomedical engineering is more design of medical devices and chemical engineering is design of manufacturing processes to carry\nour large scale chemical reactions. \n\nIn terms of relating to the medical field, obviously biomedical engineering is more close. Chemical engineering can be applied to pharmaceuticals and CGMP and such too. \n\nI\u2019m actually a second year looking to switch from chemical engineering to chemistry, so we\u2019re living like opposite lives haha. I definitely know of some pre-med engineers who have been successful, but personally I feel like it\u2019s better to just focus on one discipline if you already know what to do. Engineering experience will likely not be relevant to med school and clinical experience will not be relevant to engineering jobs, so you\u2019ll ultimately have to choose one over the other.\n\nAll in all, I think engineering (at the bachelor\u2019s level) is all about machinery. Tissue engineering (and I guess clinical engineering too) is a higher level position and I think you\u2019d be better prepared with a background in the sciences like biology and chemistry, rather than a background of engineering which is predominately math and physics.\n\nNot sure if chemical engineers can become biomedical engineers. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible to do a CHE undergrad and BME masters, but there would obviously be a learning curve associated with it. The chemical engineering job market will likely still be stable, maybe a slight shift from coal and petroleum to renewable energy if that\u2019s an industry you\u2019re interested in.\n\nHope some of that helps, good luck!",
