  "title:": "Which Masters Program Should I Take PURELY Based On Future Salary?",
  "text": "Hi guys!\n\nSo as a bit of a background, I am currently a senior at my university graduating in the Spring of 2022 with a dual degree in Pure Mathematics and Secondary Education, so my goal is obviously to be a high school teacher haha. I was thinking of going into grad school not directly after I graduate, but instead during my summers as a teacher since I want some experience first.\n\nMy question is this: which Masters degree should I pursue if I was PURELY looking for a higher salary as a teacher/educator? I love both subjects equally, maybe math a little more, but I am pretty much split on which Masters program to do so I am leaving the decision up to my future salary!\n\nI have heard from my girlfriend that I should even consider a degree in Education Administration or something similar, so I am definitely taking that into account.\n\nAny help at all would be awesome! Thanks guys!",
