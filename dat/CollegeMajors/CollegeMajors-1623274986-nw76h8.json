  "text": "Com with digital media Or mass com with a heavy emphasis on video production. The school I got into for video is fresno state. The one for comm is bakersfield. The comm degree is like half in comm half in digital media so some video courses. The video degree is mostly all video. I would love to work in video production more than anything but I also really enjoy the hospitality and tourism field and would enjoy working in that field in so cal or las Vegas so i know communications would come in handy for that. Fresno state is a nicer school and it has the video program I really wanted but since I had to appeal I already sort of put it in my head that I would go to the other school. Any advice or input please. Much appreciated. Ps got into other schools but since i live in the middle of these 2 ill be commuting an hour either way",
