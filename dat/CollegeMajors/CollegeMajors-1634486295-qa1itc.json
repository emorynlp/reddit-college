      "text": "Literally any of those options are great! Employers will mostly care about your CS degree, internships, and past projects, not the differences between a math or statistics minor. Data science might help a tiny bit more if you specifically want a data science job, but it probably overlaps a lot with your CS degree already. Do whichever one you enjoy most.",

              "text": "For a student, a major requires more courses than a minor. If you double major instead of minoring, you will have less room in your schedule for other types of courses. It may take you longer to graduate depending on how much overlap there is between majors and how many courses each one requires. You may also have to take some harder courses that you otherwise would (depending on if you personally find upper-level courses in the second major difficult).",

The vote is leaning towards a CS major with a data science minor, and am kind of perplexed by this outcome. Aren't there a lot of overlap between them, and maybe that will make me the most money after graduation? (I'm leaning towards CS major with math minor since I enjoy math)\n\nAlso, is there a thesis paper required for a bachelor's degree, and if so, would I have to write two for a double major? (or an additional one for a minor also?)",

                      "text": "It really all depends on your school. Some schools require a thesis or senior project for a major, but some don\u2019t. The level of overlap probably varies from school to school too. You\u2019re going to have research major/minor requirements at whichever college you choose. You can usually find a list of required courses and graduation requirements for each major somewhere on the school website.\n\nI think people are choosing the data science option mostly because it\u2019s closely related to a specific career (which you may or may not be interested in). They might also just think it sounds more interesting to them.",
